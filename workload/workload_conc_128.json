    "prefix_text": "\n \n\u201cRISHE IRMGARD WEITZNER! You are a vile woman! A truly malicious creature unworthy of the crown prince! As of this instant, our engagement is off!\u201d \n\u201cAs you wish, Your Highness.\u201d\n\u201c\u2026Huh?\u201d\nThe prince\u2019s declaration echoed throughout the ballroom. Rishe, the duke\u2019s daughter, bowed in response, her coral-toned hair swaying gracefully. The assembled guests found themselves captivated by her dignified beauty. Despite having just witnessed a broken engagement, they couldn\u2019t bring themselves to pity her.\nSlowly, Rishe lifted her head and fixed the prince with a pale-emerald gaze. It caught him off guard, but he quickly recovered.\n\u201cDidn\u2019t you hear what I just said?! I\u2019m calling off our engagement! Doesn\u2019t that trouble you?\u201d\n\u201cNot really.\u201d\nRishe already knew what happened next: false accusations, exile, and her family severing all ties and leaving her to survive on her own. She turned from the prince. There was no point wasting any time.\nThis is my seventh loop, after all.\nRishe had done this all before.\nThe next few hours will be busy. I must hurry and retrieve my things before I\u2019m barred from the family estate. I don\u2019t want this to be one of the times I\u2019m too slow and I have to start my new life with nothing.\n\u201cRishe, halt and hear me! I have spent the past week perfecting my recitation of your crimes!\u201d\nI should take more than dresses this time\u2014there\u2019s plenty of things I could use out in the world. What trade should I take up? In my first life, I was a merchant. In my second, an apothecary. I\u2019ve got a few more I want to try out\u2026 Augh! If time\u2019s just going to keep resetting, I wish I could start at an earlier point. I need more time to prepare!\n\u201cWait! Rishe!\u201d\nThe crown prince was on the verge of tears, and the spectators struggled to suppress their snickers. \nA thought occurred to Rishe, and she stopped. She then turned, her eyes gleaming beneath long lashes as she stared down her ex-fianc\u00e9. \u201cAh, Your Highness, I almost forgot.\u201d \n\u201cYes, tell me!\u201d the prince fumed. \u201cLet me guess, you are hurt beyond measure and yet love me still\u2026correct?\u201d\nAs if. Rishe was grateful to be granted her freedom. In fact, she was smiling as she said, \u201cI hope you and Lady Mary are happy together.\u201d\n\u201cWhat?!\u201d\n\u201cMay we both lead fulfilling lives. Farewell!\u201d Rishe lifted the skirts of her evening gown and turned on her heel, departing as briskly as she could.\n\u201cHow do you know about Mary? I haven\u2019t told you I love her!\u201d The prince was shouting something behind her, but she paid him no mind. She had things to do.\nDuring her first loop, the prince\u2019s accusations had shocked her to the core and she\u2014foolishly so\u2014had attempted to defend herself. Now she knew better than to expect the prince to behave reasonably. \nHow will life unfold this time? I\u2019m excited to find out! Rishe fixed her mind on the future.\nThis is my seventh \u201cdo-over.\u201d I\u2019ve led happy and carefree lives before, but this time\u2014this time, I swear I\u2019ll live a long happy and carefree life!\nIn other words, she needed to avoid getting killed. At any cost. \n \n***\n \nIn the first loop, with her engagement broken and her reputation in tatters, Rishe roamed with nothing but the clothes on jewelry. Finding them a good-natured band, she hitched a ride to a neighboring country.\nFrom the merchant caravan, she learned a trade, studying how to procure stock and balance ledgers. Eventually, she set out on her own to travel the world. Her upbringing as a daughter of the nobility meant that, even at fifteen years old, Rishe possessed a keen sense for beauty.\nShe collected things that caught her eye and sold them to whoever found delight in her wares. Before she realized it, she had become a major vendor, employing a full staff. She had even done business with the king of a desert nation and the prince of a frozen country up north. She traveled to many distant places, realizing a dream born from her cossetted former life spent doing nothing but preparing to be queen.\nFive years passed, and just as she had only one country left to visit, Rishe fell victim to the war sweeping across the continent.\nThe next thing she knew, she was fifteen years old again and back at that party, with the prince poised to make his pronouncement.\n\u201cRishe Irmgard Weitzner! You are a vile woman! A truly malicious creature unworthy of the crown prince! As of this instant, our engagement is off!\u201d\nNaturally, she didn\u2019t understand what was going on at first. She looked around. Everything was the same. She stood in the same place wearing the same dress and draped in the same jewelry she\u2019d sold to the caravan.\nWas it a dream? Or was everything that had happened up until then the dream? In her confusion, all she could do was stare.\nRishe hurried out of the ballroom, the impending threat of exile hanging over her and the prince\u2019s entreaties to halt ringing in her ears.\nThis is perfect! Now I can get it right! I\u2019ll grab everything valuable from my room.\nRishe had enjoyed her life as a merchant, but she had always felt a stirring of regret about this night. If only she\u2019d brought some funds from home, she would\u2019ve had the capital to establish her business much sooner!\nSpeaking of this regret always prompted disbelief from her customers, including the king of the desert. \u201cWhat? That\u2019s what you\u2019d want to do over?!\u201d\nWhen she arrived back at home on the night of her second life, Rishe grabbed her jewelry box and as many of the books her late grandmother had left her as she could carry, then made haste to the forest to meet the caravan. But the stop at her house took time, and she missed them completely.\nIn that moment, Rishe made a stark realization. Different choices meant different mistakes. Opening one door would close another.\nAnd so the easy path to a life in commerce was closed to her.\nSure, she could try to build her business from the ground up, but personal connections were almost as essential to being a merchant as business savvy. It just wasn\u2019t realistic without a single acquaintance. \nSorting through her belongings in resignation, she came across a foreign encyclopedia of herbs among her grandmother\u2019s books. Taking it as a sign, Rishe sold her jewels elsewhere and used the funds to cross the sea and pursue the study of medicine.\nFortunately, Rishe retained all her knowledge from her previous life. She remembered that certain expensive herbs could be acquired cheaply in other regions. When word spread of a disease running rampant in a neighboring country, she recalled that too. This foreknowledge proved invaluable, as did her wide travel and exposure to many different teachers with many different points of view.\nAs such, Rishe led a successful life as an apothecary. She saved a feeble prince, synthesized a number of rare medicines with her mercantile knowledge, and thus spent her days in the simple joy of helping those in need.\nUnfortunately, all the joy in the world couldn\u2019t stand up to an epidemic. Thus ended her second life. \nOnce again, she found herself in the moment of her broken engagement, the curtain rising on the third loop. Her next four lives proceeded much the same way. As a skilled lady\u2019s maid, she helped a young noblewoman to a fortuitous marriage. Once, she even disguised herself as a man and became a knight. Every life was worth living, and she enjoyed them all. She enjoyed living, period.\nThere was just one problem.\nNo matter what I do, I die at twenty.\nShe enjoyed her lives, but she was not permitted to do so for long. With this time limit always hanging over her, she spent each loop in a state of constant activity.\nI would love to take it easy for a while. Is a little leisure time too much to ask? Obviously I don\u2019t want to die either! This time, I\u2019ll make as much money as I can in the first five years. Then, when I turn twenty, I\u2019ll live a life free of worldly cares. I\u2019ll do whatever\u2019s necessary to stay alive!\nHer mind made up, Rishe began her seventh life in a dead sprint through the palace",
    "query_text": ". Regardless of her future plans, she was in a race against time. She needed to beat the messenger bearing news of her scandal.\nAs she ran, she yanked off her hair ornaments; she planned to sell them and didn\u2019t want to risk losing one. Her hair billowed out behind her, falling in loose waves.\nSuddenly, an idea occurred to her, one she hadn\u2019t had in any of her previous six lives.\nLeaving through the palace gardens would be faster. I can climb down a tree from the balcony.\nRishe had gone to war as a knight in the life just before this one. After the punishing battlefield training, climbing trees was nothing.\nSeamlessly, she changed direction. She raced for the balcony, where she ran into something at full speed.\n\u201cBwargh!\u201d Ris"

    "prefix_text": " flagrant disrespect!\u201d\n\u201cDietrich, don\u2019t pay them any mind,\u201d Lady Mary said. \u201cLady Rishe, is this cruelty necessary?\u201d\n\u201cPerhaps this is a blessing in disguise.\u201d Rishe\u2019s attention moved to Mary, making the girl\u2019s slender shoulders jump. She had no reason to worry; Rishe didn\u2019t bite. \u201cI\u2019ve been wanting the opportunity to speak to you, Lady Mary. You\u2019re strong. I admire you very much.\u201d\n\u201cWhat are you talking about?\u201d\n\u201cYou\u2019re a lovely girl who never fails to smile despite your troubles. You don\u2019t put up walls around your heart, and you do your utmost to put others at ease. Even now, you bravely stand before me to protect the prince.\u201d\nMary\u2019s eyes were wide with confusion. Rishe picked her words carefully, attempting to diminish the girl\u2019s guilty feelings, if only a little. \u201cYou need to marry the prince for your family\u2019s sake, right?\u201d\n\u201cHow do you\u2014?\u201d\nRishe had learned this truth in one of her past lives. Mary was born to a poor family, and she had studied like mad to be accepted into the academy to hunt for a husband. She intended to make sure neither she nor her brothers ever went hungry again.\nShe went on, \u201cRemember this: you are the one in control of your life. Don\u2019t sell it to anyone else. Can you trust a man who so easily discards the woman he\u2019s been engaged to since childhood? Do you truly believe he cares for you?\u201d\nAstonishment bloomed across Mary\u2019s face. She looked over at Dietrich, who hadn\u2019t bothered to stand up. The truth was\u2026within a year, Prince Dietrich would be in prison, his title stripped from him. He would plan a mad coup d\u2019\u00e9tat against the king, attempting to provoke the citizens to war. His plan would be discovered in its early stages, rendering him a laughingstock across the kingdom.\n\u201cYou must shape your future with your own hands\u2014you mustn\u2019t entrust your desires to others.\u201d \n\u201cMy\u2026my desires?\nRishe nodded.\nMary was looking at her like she was speaking a foreign language. \u201cBut I\u2019m their elder sister.\u201d Her voice quivered. \u201cI must endure, no matter what. Otherwise, my brothers will never be happy.\u201d\n\u201cAnd you believe their happiness can only be achieved by sacrificing your own?\u201d\nMary gasped as she gaped at Rishe.\n\u201cYou don\u2019t need to throw away your own future to protect those you love,\u201d Rishe told her. \u201cNo matter what path you choose, never forget that.\u201d\n\u201cMy future?\u201d Mary\u2019s voice went ragged, like she was barely suppressing a wail of pain.\n\u201cI wish you a life where both you and your family can be happy,\u201d said Rishe.\nMary stood frozen in place, eyes gleaming like precious stones. Rishe couldn\u2019t help but admire how pretty she was. She truly did wish her happiness. But right now, she needed to take care of herself. \n\u201cWell.\u201d Rishe suddenly broke into a smile, making Dietrich flinch. \u201cI think it\u2019s time for me to be on my way.\u201d\nShe regretted losing access to her room, but she knew her parents wouldn\u2019t let her in. Turning her back on the crowd, Rishe contemplated her next move.\n\u201cWait, Lady Rishe!\u201d Mary\u2019s voice rang out.\n\u201cThat\u2019s right. You\u2019re not going anywhere, Rishe!\u201d The prince joined her. \u201cYou won\u2019t get away with treating me like trash to relieve your own injured heart.\u201d\n\u201cUgh, enough already!\u201d Rishe\u2019s patience was fraying. \u201cI don\u2019t have anything else to say to you. Goodbye!\u201d\n\u201cKnights, stop her!\u201d\nReluctantly, the knights moved to tail Rishe as she walked briskly back down the path. She sympathized with them, but she wasn\u2019t about to let them keep her here. Rounding a corner, she sensed something uncanny. She stopped, the knights quickly catching up with her.\n\u201cMy apologies, Lady Rishe. If you could please remain for just a\u2014whoa!\u201d\nRishe grabbed the hilt of the knight\u2019s sword. Yanking it from his belt, she spun around and stood at the ready. Metal rang against metal as Rishe parried a blow. She glared at her would-be attacker as he stepped out of the shadows.\nArnold Hein!\n\u201cWell, what do you know.\u201d The man smiling so sweetly while their swords locked was the very man who had ended her life. \u201cYou do have some skill.\u201d\nMetal screeched and slid, before Arnold sheathed his sword. Rishe lowered hers. Neither looked away.\n\u201cWho the hell are you?\u201d demanded one of the knights.\n\u201cStand down, good sirs,\u201d Rishe said. \u201cYour interference will only make this worse.\u201d\nThis mostly served to befuddle the knights further. Rishe absolutely couldn\u2019t allow them to come to blows with the crown prince of a friendly nation. And they couldn\u2019t beat him\u2014not even if they took him all at once. Rishe had blocked his blow, but her arm was completely numb. To think he\u2019d be even more powerful in five years.\nHe regarded her unabashedly. \u201cRishe, was that your name? Where did you learn such swordsmanship?\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m afraid I cannot say. Besides, you were clearly going easy on me.\u201d\n\u201cHa! You could tell?\u201d\nArnold\u2019s manner was throwing her off. He seemed to be enjoying himself. He\u2019s laughing. This monstrous prince is\u2026actually laughing.\nWhen she had met him in her other life, he was cold and merciless, like a genuine monster. And yet here he stood, mellow and smiling.\nThe Emperor Arnold Hein I knew was twenty-four years old, so he\u2019s, what? Nineteen now? This is so weird. He\u2019s grinning like a boy getting into a scrape.\nThat attack had been good-natured as well, almost playful. It had muscle behind it but certainly not any lethal intent. He\u2019d just wanted to force Rishe to catch the blow. She found it unbelievable that he could exude such an overpowering air of menace when he was just messing around.\nWhile Rishe was focused on Arnold, Mary and Dietrich caught up, seemingly recovered.\n\u201cExcuse me, my lord!\u201d Mary squeaked. \u201cI-I-I don\u2019t know who you are, but kindly step away from Lady Rishe!\u201d\n\u201cYes, do as she says! Who the hell are you, anyway?!\u201d\nDon\u2019t tell me Prince Dietrich doesn\u2019t recognize one of his personal guests.\nDietrich\u2019s interests did not lean toward diplomacy; he likely hadn\u2019t bothered to introduce himself to Arnold. Mary, for her part, seemed to grasp that Arnold wasn\u2019t ordinary. She stood up to defend Rishe, despite the tremble in her voice. In a better world, perhaps the two of them could have become friends.\n\u201cThat\u2019s your ex-fianc\u00e9?\u201d Arnold cocked a brow. \u201cHe\u2019s even worse than I imagined. Pathetic.\u201d\nDietrich flushed. \u201cI\u2019ll have your head!\u201d\n\u201cDietrich, I beg of you, contain yourself,\u201d Rishe said, then rounded on Arnold. \u201cAs for you, Your Highness\u2014you know who Dietrich is, and you know what speaking carelessly could mean. Are you trying to pick a fight?\u201d\n\u201cWhatever do you mean?\u201d Arnold\u2019s brows lifted high, making him the picture of innocence. \u201cBelieve me, Lady Rishe, every word I speak is chosen with extreme care.\u201d\nFinally realizing who Arnold was, Dietrich visibly paled. \u201cArnold? He\u2019s the crown prince of Galkhein?\u201d\nMary yelped. The knights stood down, shamefaced. The gossip-hungry neighbors who\u2019d gathered to witness a scandal play out drew back in fear.\n\u201cHe\u2019s the demon prince? The one who single-handedly destroyed a whole order of enemy knights?\u201d\n\u201cWatch your tongue, fool! Do you want him to do the same to you?\u201d\nThe two nations enjoyed peaceful relations, but Arnold remained the dreaded prince, heir to the throne of a former enemy. Current rumor wasn\u2019t as widespread as it would be in five years, but he was still regarded with distrust.\nThe onlookers stood rooted to the spot, too terrified to flee.\nWell, this has devolved into a full-fledged disaster.\nRishe heaved a frustrated sigh. \u201cPrince Arnold, to what do we owe this honor? Surely a crown prince would not draw his sword for a mere jest.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m here on business,\u201d Arnold said. \u201cBut first, I must beg forgiveness for my rudeness.\u201d\nHuh, what do you know? Once he became emperor, he\u2019d gladly behead any subject who so much as dared speak a word against him.\nI guess at nineteen he still knew how to apologize.\nIf that surprised her, Arnold\u2019s next act completely obliterated her sense of reality. \nWith a flourish, he fell to his knees. \n\u201cHuh?\u201d Is this actually happening? \nHe was a man destined for an imperial crown. A man who would stand at the head of a military powerhouse and spread his rule across continents.\nArnold, known for his frigid pride, knelt to the disgraced daughter of a duke.\nAnd not only that\u2014his head was bowed, looking nothing so much as a knight swearing allegiance to his lady. If it were anyone else, it would be a delightful, pious image. Instead, the assembled looked on in terrified awe.\nNot Rishe, though.\n\u201cWhat are you doing?\u201d she hissed. \u201cGet up!\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m apologizing for my baseless impertinence. Also, I\u2019m asking you\u2026\u201d He trailed off to take Rishe\u2019s hand, tugging her forward so forcefully she staggered. He gazed up at her.\nUgh. He\u2019s so beautiful. No matter how many times she looked at him, it didn\u2019t become any less disarming. Long eyelashes, arched brows, a noble nose. His bright blue eyes reminded her of the drift ice she\u2019d seen in a northern kingdom, gazing out from a ship in one of her past lives. She knew she was dwelling on this to buy time, even as the reality before her sank in.\n\u201c\u2026to become my wife.\u201d\nShe froze, unable to process the words. \u201cWhat?\u201d Rishe glanced around, desperately searching the faces of the crowd. They all seemed as stunned as she felt. She looked down at Arnold again. \u201cYour wife?\u201d \n\u201cYes, that\u2019s right.\u201d\n\u201cYou want me to become your wife?\u201d\n\u201cYes.\u201d\nRishe couldn\u2019t speak. This was truly happening. It was real. It clicked into place in her head, and she let out a strangled grunt.\nWhat is going on? Why is this happening?\nShock lapped at her, fuzzing at the corners of her vision. He wanted to marry her. Arnold wanted to marry Rishe. Her murderer wanted to marry her.\nWhy is he doing this? He must have some ulterior motive, a broader goal. But I have to give him an answer.\nThe onlookers were holding their breath as Rishe said flatly, \u201cI reject your proposal.\u201d\nArnold said nothing.\nShe had to reject him. She was going to live a long, peaceful, carefree life, damn it, and no one would stop her. And yet\u2026\nArnold began to laugh, and the deep, creeping sense of dread inside Rishe only grew. Why does he seem so amused by this?!\n \n***\n \nHer previous life was her sixth. Disguised as a man, Rishe rose as a warrior of an island country she came upon in her travels. It was a conventional yet charming kingdom formed of red brick. After striking up a friendship with a group of knights who didn\u2019t realize she was a woman, Rishe followed their advice and joined them.\nThe training was grueling enough to make her wish she were dead. Back when she had lived as a noble, she\u2019d learned how to wield a sword for basic self-defense, but training as a noble lady had in no way prepared her for this. She drilled relentlessly, barely taking the time to sleep. Just as she became a full-fledged knight, Emperor Arnold\u2019s forces lay siege to the castle.\n \n***\n \nHow could this happen? \nIn her seventh life, Rishe wearily sank into her chair. Across from her sat Arnold, his legs crossed and chin propped up on his hand, watching her lazily.\n\u201cWhat\u2019s the matter?\u201d he asked. \u201cYou seem unhappy.\u201d\n\u201cYou could say that.\u201d Even her voice was grumpy. Still, she couldn\u2019t very well tell him it was because she bore a grudge from a previous life. After the first time her life rewound to that pivotal moment, she\u2019d resolved to keep her loops a secret. \u201cI had plans for my exile. A brand-new life. And now because of you, my parents are involved. Even the king has heard about it!\u201d\nAfter Rishe rejected Arnold, Dietrich had immediately cried out, \u201cTh-the crown prince of Galkhein proposed to Rishe?!\u201d\nHis shrieks were loud enough to attract the attention of the master and mistress of the manor.\nWhen her parents came out, Rishe had protested, \u201cI\u2019m not going to marry him! I\u2019m leaving the country just as Dietrich commanded.\u201d\nNo one listened. Their faces just paled with nervous confusion.\nJust then, a glittering coach arrived. Half-stuck in the mud, the man inside it was forced to trudge over the swampy ground, and so the king of Hermity himself arrived, staggering and dirt-stained. \nHe grabbed hold of his son\u2019s collar, pushing him into a low bow. He then turned to Prince Arnold and said, rather loudly, \u201cYour Highness! Allow me to apologize for my son\u2019s foolishness! You are an esteemed guest all the way from Galkhein! It is unthinkable he would not offer you the courtesy you are due!\u201d\n\u201cYou\u2019re hurting me, Father! My back!\u201d\nThe king then turned to Rishe. \u201cMy lady, allow me to sincerely apologize as both a king and a father. My son\u2019s behavior toward you has been utterly disgraceful. I beg you to please give Prince Arnold\u2019s proposal due consideration. Not only for your own sake but for the sake of your country.\u201d\nThe king bowed to her as deeply as his son had to Arnold, and her parents joined him. Rishe felt dizzy at the sight of this abject debasement in the presence of citizens.\nArnold, who had been watching the proceedings with a detached amusement, sobered and stepped toward the king. \u201cYour Majesty, please rise.\u201d\nWithout the smirk, Arnold\u2019s face immediately reverted to its cold mask. The king didn\u2019t move. Maybe something in Arnold\u2019s voice kept him frozen.\n\u201cSuch a trifle won\u2019t cause discord between our kingdoms,\u201d he went on. \u201cHowever, I would beg a little time to speak with Lady Rishe.\u201d\nLater, Rishe would learn that Arnold\u2019s attendant had spoken to the king\u2019s own gentleman, certain that his words would reach their target. \u201cMy master took such trouble to attend these festivities, and this is the welcome he is offered? I wonder, what will the emperor think when he learns of his son\u2019s slighting at your nation\u2019s hands?\u201d\n\u201cIf you would, Lady Rishe?\u201d The plump king looked to be on the verge of tears.\nRishe had no obligation to accept and no desire to spend a moment longer in this country than was absolutely necessary. But acquiescence seemed the fastest way to move things along.\nAs her mind whirled, Arnold leaned in to whisper, \u201cIf you refuse to hear my suit, you won\u2019t deter me. I\u2019ll simply move on to Plan B.\u201d\nAnd that was how she found herself in one of the palace\u2019s parlors, here to \u201cjust talk\u201d to Prince Arnold. The ball guests were all gone. It was just the two of them.\n\u201cI want to know what you\u2019re planning,\u201d Rishe said flatly.\n\u201cPlanning? Me?\u201d\n\u201cBy asking me to marry you. You don\u2019t know me. A proposal like this wouldn\u2019t come out of the blue.\u201d\nThis man was destined to become an aggressive warmonger over the next few years. He wouldn\u2019t do anything without a dozen motives.\nPrince Arnold just smiled. \u201cI have no plans. I\u2019m simply enamored with you.\u201d\n\u201cEnamored\u2026?\u201d\nThat was the last thing she\u2019d expected him to say. Asking him to elaborate didn\u2019t seem worth the breath\u2014he was obviously lying. As if this ruthless, inhuman creature with ice in his veins could feel even a flicker of affection.\n\u201cWhy refuse me?\u201d Arnold asked. \u201cYour engagement is broken, you\u2019re on the verge of exile, and you have no faction or supporters. At this rate, you\u2019ll be dead within a fortnight. I\u2019d call my offer a stroke of unbelievable fortune.\u201d\n\u201cYou\u2019re not wrong,\u201d Rishe admitted. \u201cOnce upon a time, I would have jumped at your offer.\u201d\nIf it had been made in her first life, for instance. But now Rishe knew better. Her life was only just getting started, and the future held endless possibilities. After the horror of her sixth loop, she yearned for freedom.\nI don\u2019t want to marry him. I won\u2019t be anyone\u2019s captive. Still\u2026\nRishe, more than anyone, knew that the slightest adjustment could enact profound changes on the trajectory of a life. No doubt she\u2019d have many more lives, but this could be the only one where marriage to Arnold would be an option.\nThe dread emperor. The tyrant. The man who will stoke the fires of war. \nRishe knew the gossip, the endless conjecture behind Arnold Hein\u2019s bloody reign, but she didn\u2019t know the truth.\nWhy? The question had haunted her since her first life. She\u2019d never before had the chance to even speak to him.\nShe had wondered it as a merchant, hearing of the distant outbreak of war. She\u2019d wondered when the news of the dead and dying reached her apothecary. When she had comforted her terrified mistress in her life as a maid, assuring her everything would be all right. When she squared off against him in battle, as he plunged a sword through her heart\u2014even then she wondered. \nIf I stick around, maybe I\u2019ll finally have my answer. Half of her was dying to know. The other half didn\u2019t give a damn. And yet\u2026\nShe recalled a childhood dream. Rather, a longing.\nRishe let out a breath. \u201cYou claim you are enamored with me.\u201d\n\u201cYes. I am completely under your spell.\u201d\nTo think he could spout such nonsense with a straight face!\n\u201cThen will you grant me anything I desire?\u201d\n\u201cSo long as it is within my power,\u201d Arnold said. \u201cAnything you want will be yours.\u201d\nRishe hesitated, gathering her thoughts. \u201cI have some conditions.\u201d Arnold silently motioned for",
    "query_text": " her to go on. \u201cI want full control over the wedding festivities. Everything must be procured through merchants of my choosing.\u201d\n\u201cFine.\u201d Arnold nodded. \u201cYou\u2019re free to do business with whomever you wish.\u201d\n\u201cAfter we are married, I must be in a position to mingle with guests from abroad.\u201d\n\u201cThat sounds within the purview of the crown princess. Anything else?\u201d\n\u201cI will be allowed to live in a separate residence from your mother"

    "prefix_text": ", that\u2019s how.\n\u201cI assume there\u2019s more to you than your devotion to the sword. You seem to like flowers.\u201d\nShe followed Arnold\u2019s gaze to where she\u2019d bundled a small bouquet in a handkerchief. This was their fifth day on the road to Galkhein. Every day, without fail, she\u2019d picked flowers whenever they stopped to water the horses. The ones from today were still fresh, but the ones she\u2019d begun drying five days ago were just about ready.\n\u201cI didn\u2019t pick these because they\u2019re pretty.\u201d Rishe brought the blooms to her face, spirits rising at their sweet scent. Spring wildflowers had a soft and gentle smell. Rishe looked out the window at the forest spreading toward Galkhein, thinking of the rare native flowers going into bloom. She wished she could pick those as well, but that would cause too much delay. She gazed on wistfully.\nAfter watching her in silence for some time, Arnold said, \u201cBy the way, I sent one of my men ahead on a fast horse to deliver your order to the company you requested. They\u2019ll be invited to Galkhein to discuss the wedding ceremony.\u201d\n\u201cThank you,\u201d Rishe said. \u201cI\u2019m glad you kept your word.\u201d\n\u201cThe Aria Trading Company,\u201d Arnold mused. \u201cI\u2019ve heard of them. They\u2019re up-and-comers, aren\u2019t they? Have you done business with them before?\u201d\n\u201cNo, but I heard from a friend that they hold a very high standard of quality.\u201d\nRishe was pleasantly surprised at how easily Arnold had acceded to her request. Typically, a royal household had their own personal dealer. Getting them to do business with someone else could be difficult.\nI want to establish a connection with Aria as soon as possible, Rishe thought. It was, of course, the company that had taken her in during her first life.\nThe company had been established just two years prior to picking her up by its owner, a man named Tully. They were still in their growth stage, but in just a few years, they would be the grandest trading company in all the world. They\u2019d proven a great boon in her life as an apothecary as well, helping to distribute her newest medicines. She\u2019d struggled to win their trust initially, but she pledged to work much harder this time around.\nThis marriage isn\u2019t going to happen\u2014I need an escape plan for when it all falls apart. I must bring to bear all my knowledge and influence as a crown princess.\nRishe didn\u2019t know Arnold\u2019s plans, but she had no intention of sitting around and waiting for him to use her as he pleased. She\u2019d spend her time as his consort wisely. Everything must serve her ultimate goal: to live longer than five years, and live well.\nHer fierce determination must have shown on her face because Arnold gave her a little bemused smile. \u201cYes?\u201d\nGod! Rishe grimaced at that flawlessly handsome countenance. Such beauty, possessed by such powerful destruction. The fact that he\u2019d been the man to kill her did nothing to lessen her fascination. In fact, it almost made it worse. The study of contrasts.\n\u201cSorry, I just\u2014\u201d\nShe was interrupted by the horses\u2019 loud whinnies.\n\u201cStop! Hey, stop the coach!\u201d\nShouts drifted back from conveyance ahead of theirs, which contained the luggage and attendants. The squadron of knights tailing the column of coaches sped off toward the front.\n\u201cWho do you think you\u2014graaargh!\u201d\nThat didn\u2019t sound good. Rishe moved to climb out, but Arnold was faster. He drew his sword.\n\u201cHey!\u201d\nArnold locked the door from the outside. \u201cStay hidden.\u201d\nWhy is he putting himself in danger? That\u2019s what knights are for! The fact that Rishe had been about to do the same thing didn\u2019t occur to her. It\u2019s probably bandits. He told me to stay hidden in here, but I\u2019m not so sure about that.\nArnold had left her locked in from the outside, hoping to keep her safe, but Rishe didn\u2019t like her odds. There were five coaches, but this one was certainly the grandest. It locked on the inside as well, but that wouldn\u2019t stop someone with enough determination. If she did as she was told, she\u2019d just be waiting patiently for a bandit to break a window and drag her out.\nKeeping one eye on the coachmen fleeing into the forest, Rishe began a methodical search for something to help her. Right\u2014her hairpin!\nThis sure brings me back. She unfastened it, twisting it into the gap in the door. Back when I was a maid, my lady would lock herself in her chambers all the time to avoid her studies. I had to break her out just like this.\nThe lock on the coach was simple, and it came open easily. Once she was free, she scanned her surroundings. She didn\u2019t see anyone who looked immediately hostile, but there was noise up ahead. Cautiously, she headed toward it.\nBefore long, she found Arnold.\nWow.\nRoughly ten men\u2014the bandits, she presumed\u2014lay crumpled on the ground. In their midst stood Arnold, in the process of tripping another man into the dirt. He scowled, blade at the man\u2019s throat. \u201cIs that it, then?\u201d\n\u201cGwugh!\u201d\nArnold kicked the bandit in the stomach, eyes blazing with cruelty. \u201cThat\u2019s all the thrill you offer me after I went to the trouble of drawing my sword? Barely worth it. I\u2019m bored already.\u201d\nHe wasn\u2019t angry; on the contrary, he stared his enemies down with chilly disappointment, as if this had all been a letdown. Even Arnold\u2019s own knights seemed terrified of their master when he was in a mood. Arnold smoothly flicked the blood off his sword, wiping the blade on the bandit\u2019s shirt before sheathing it. The rest of the men on the ground seemed to be unconscious.\nWait, he didn\u2019t kill anyone? Why not? Is it because we haven\u2019t reached Galkhein?\nShe supposed even Arnold knew better than to go around killing the citizens of other countries. Or perhaps he had yet to become the ruthless monster she knew him as.\nArnold seemed to sense her gaze, turning around with a start. Genuine emotion bloomed on his face, worlds away from the blank mask he wore to face down the bandits. \u201cHow did you get out of the coach?\u201d\nRishe shrugged. \u201cIf I tell you, you\u2019ll be able to prevent me from doing it again.\u201d\nArnold snickered. \u201cYou continue to amaze me.\u201d\nHow can you go from ice-cold to suddenly looking like a normal nineteen-year-old? It\u2019s disconcerting. \nRishe fought down her disquiet as a man alighted from a coach and shouted, \u201cYour Highness! Not again!\u201d He was Oliver, one of the prince\u2019s attendants. He had silver hair and was roughly as tall as Arnold.\n\u201cWhat do you think all these knights are for, decoration? Why do you insist on endangering yourself?\u201d\nRishe had only met Oliver briefly a few days ago, but he didn\u2019t appear to be intimidated by Arnold at all. And, well\u2026he\u2019s not wrong.\nShe feared the menace would return to Arnold\u2019s expression, but he just looked annoyed. \u201cI could tell they were prepared to kill. I\u2019d prefer to take the burden on myself than risk multiple injuries so far afield. And we already have casualties.\u201d\nHe was right. Several injured knights leaned listlessly among the trees. Arnold issued orders to those still able-bodied. \u201cFirst squad, see to the wounded. Second squad, arrest these men.\u201d\n\u201cYes, sir!\u201d\nOliver appeared unsatisfied. \u201cYour Highness, that is a weak justification. I\u2019m overjoyed you\u2019re well, but you must consider Lady Rishe. Perhaps next time we run into a team of murderous brigands, you could allow your consort to remain in the coach.\u201d\n\u201cI told her to remain in the coach!\u201d\nRishe quickly averted her gaze, turning her attention to the wounded knights. They didn\u2019t appear badly injured, yet they all seemed exhausted.\n\u201cExcuse me, can I take a look?\u201d Rishe approached the knight acting as a medic. He looked round, startled by her presence.\n\u201cNonsense, my lady. Don\u2019t trouble yourself, you must have had quite a scare.\u201d\nThis was not unreasonable, but the wariness in his eyes made it clear he wanted her nowhere near his comrade. He isn\u2019t just being polite. He truly is on guard. \nBeside them, an injured knight groaned as another helped him up. \u201cWhat\u2019s wrong with you?\u201d the second knight asked the first. \n\u201cI-I feel\u2026numb.\u201d\n\u201cWhat? Damn.\u201d The knight grabbed up one of the fallen bandit\u2019s swords, going pale as he inspected the blade. \u201cYour Highness, look at this. Poison.\u201d\nArnold clicked his tongue. \u201cLocate every laceration and bind them close to the heart. Suck the poison from the wounds.\u201d\nHe mostly got that right, at least. In the meantime, Rishe located the nearest bound bandit and pulled his dagger out of its sheath. Its wet coating gleamed in the sunlight, just as the knight had said.\nThey applied the poison liberally\u2014whatever it is must be cheap and easily bought in bulk.\nShe wafted the smell toward her, bracing for something rancid, but detected nothing. Then she brought it closer to her nose.\nIt smells sweet, like an overripe apple. Shea grass and\u2026bluecap mushrooms. All the knights appear to have the same symptoms, so I won\u2019t have to check every blade.\nRishe stood back up and headed for the coach.\nOliver took a step after her. \u201cYour Highness, Lady Rishe is\u2014\u201d\n\u201cLeave her. She may do as she pleases.\u201d\n\u201cShe\u2019s well trained,\u201d Oliver mused. \u201cBut a battlefield is no place for a young lady. She probably wasn\u2019t prepared for such a dreadful spectacle.\u201d\nRishe ignored the murmurs and focused on her work. There they are. I\u2019ll take these, these, and\u2026\n\u201cThe poison must be a sleeping drug,\u201d she overheard Arnold saying. \u201cHunters use such drugs to weaken larger prey. I doubt this dose is lethal.\u201d\n\u201cBut it certainly is annoying,\u201d replied Oliver. \u201cWe\u2019re still two days out from Galkhein. Lugging a company of sleeping men in armor won\u2019t be pleasant.\u201d\n\u201cWe\u2019ll have to stop somewhere nearby. A hunter\u2019s settlement. Perhaps they will have an antidote\u2014\u201d\n\u201cExcuse me.\u201d Rishe, who\u2019d returned from the carriage, raised a hand. \u201cI have an antidote.\u201d\n\u201cWhat?\u201d\nThe entire company stared at her in awe.\n \n***\n \nAs it turned out, Arnold\u2019s guess was right. \nThis sweet-smelling substance was a hunter\u2019s drug, made from ingredients that were only toxic in their raw form. Heat rendered them harmless. Rishe had encountered this poison several times before, curing a customer afflicted with it during her life as an apothecary.\n\u201cA lethal dose for a grown man would fill a wine glass. They likely got less than a hundredth of that,\u201d Rishe explained to Arnold, not looking up from her work. \u201cStill, the numbness can block their airways with the roots of their tongues. It\u2019s best to lay them on their sides.\u201d\n\u201cYes, I understand the theory and the solution.\u201d Arnold gazed down at Rishe\u2019s hands. \u201cThe part I\u2019m struggling with is why you\u2019re the one telling me this.\u201d\n\u201cWell, I know how to make the antidote,\u201d Rishe said patiently as she muddled the herbs together in the white soup bowl she\u2019d borrowed for her flowers. She crushed them with the back of a spoon",
    "query_text": " before adding another dried flower, crushing that as well, and combining them to form a paste. This process would be easier with a pestle, but she wasn\u2019t about to complain. \u201cThis poison is common\u2014it\u2019s cheap and easy to make, which often means the antidote is simple as well.\u201d\nThe antidote was synthesized, in fact, when hunters witnessed a deer showing no symptoms after eating a certain mushroom. They tested those along with other common herbs the deer ate. Rishe mentally thanked them for their scientific rigor as she added a bit of water, straining it all through a cloth.\nRishe stood up"

    "prefix_text": " prince and his fianc\u00e9e.\nArnold stepped out of the coach, holding out his hand to Rishe. She took it reflexively as she alighted. A prince would be expected to help any lady out of carriage, never mind his own consort, yet for some reason the knights looked a bit disturbed.\nRishe shot them back of look of innocent confusion.\n\u201cOur long journey is at last at its end, Your Highness, Lady Rishe.\u201d Oliver emerged from the ranks of the knights, bowing. He shot Arnold a curious glance. \u201cHow novel to see you taking the hand of your fianc\u00e9e.\u201d\nAh! Rishe realized that she herself had willingly broken the condition that she had imposed. Arnold had offered his hand, but she was the one who accepted.\nArnold gave a little laugh of triumph. Rishe felt a rush of frustration at being tricked. \nOliver stared at them before leaning in to whisper in Arnold\u2019s ear. Arnold let out a breath of annoyance. \n\u201cIs something the matter?\u201d Rishe asked.\n\u201cI sent orders ahead to have a detached wing of the palace prepared for us, but it seems the preparations are behind schedule. I\u2019m sorry, but you\u2019ll need to stay in a guest room in the main palace for a few days.\u201d\n\u201cOh, I don\u2019t mind if the wing isn\u2019t ready,\u201d Rishe said. \u201cWe can head over there now.\u201d\n\u201cIt hasn\u2019t been used in quite a while. It\u2019ll be covered in dust.\u201d\n\u201cI said that I didn\u2019t mind if it was a mess, remember? But there\u2019s no need for you to put yourself out. By all means, stay in the main palace for as long as you need.\u201d Rishe had spent a life as a maid\u2014dust didn\u2019t scare her. \u201cBesides, I\u2019m a hostage, after all.\u201d\n\u201cYou could at least attempt to sound distressed,\u201d Arnold said with the slightest trace of petulance. \nRishe, who had a huge grin spreading over her face and her chest puffed out with pride, didn\u2019t respond.\n \n***\n \nThe detached wing turned out to be just a separate palace in the distant corner of the grounds\u2014a scant four stories tall and, as advertised, absolutely swimming in dust.\nNot so bad, though. Rishe had pictured decay and clutter, but it was mostly just bare. Bare and musty, but not rotten or falling apart.\n\u201cYou can do whatever you want with this place. I\u2019ll be occupied over the next few days, but feel free to use the guest apartments in the main palace if you get tired of choking to death,\u201d Arnold said before he left.\nAccording to Oliver, work had piled up while the prince was away, and it wasn\u2019t just a few things that could be dispensed with over a few days working around the clock.\nEmperor Arnold Hein\u2026 He\u2019s just a crown prince right now, but I still wish I knew what\u2019s going on in his head. For now, I\u2019ll just focus on what I can do. Like make this place livable.\nShe changed into her plainest dress and rolled up her sleeves. The knights who\u2019d remained to serve as her guard kept watch over her as she went from window to window, throwing them all open.\nIn a stroke of luck, the weather was good, and the detached wing was well placed to soak up the sun. The lack of any creature comforts made it look ascetic and drab, but once it was furnished, Rishe had no doubt it would be lovely.\nLeaving the top floors to air out, Rishe found the stairs to the basement. She pushed the heavy wooden doors open, and mice skittered over her feet. The knights yelped as Rishe descended into the darkness.\n\u201cL-Lady Rishe, why are you going down here?\u201d\n\u201cCleaning supplies are usually kept in the basement. See?\u201d\nThe knights followed her gaze to a duster, broom, dustpan, and pile of fresh cloths. She filled a bucket with water and went to work, rolling up a handkerchief to cover her mouth as she swept dust down from high on the walls. Then she swept up all the dust on the floor.\nIt\u2019s always satisfying to tackle a place this filthy.\nShe corralled the dust bunnies until they were piled up like snow in the center of the hall, and then she swept them out the open door. Once the floors were free of debris, she attacked them with the cloth.\n\u201cLady Rishe, is there anything we can do to help?\nRishe was grateful for the knight\u2019s offer, but she shook her head. \u201cYour job is to guard me, not do my housekeeping.\u201d\n\u201cThis is quite the place to clean on your own, detached though it may be,\u201d the knight said hesitantly. \u201cIt\u2019s not too late to move into the guest chambers instead.\u201d\n\u201cThat\u2019s all right. I like the place already.\u201d\nRishe remained steadfast in her refusal for one reason: readying guest chambers was an awful chore. The palace maids would be expected to work overnight to prepare them, even if the guests were only staying a single night. No speck of dust or strand of hair could remain. Certainly no wrinkled sheets. Rishe knew how exhausting and rigorous a maid\u2019s job was, how nerve-racking.\nShe refused to put the poor dears through such an ordeal for just a few days\u2019 stay. From the sound of things, the palace wasn\u2019t equipped with many housemaids. No doubt they already had their hands full.\n\u201cBesides, take a look.\u201d She held out her arms wide, gesturing to her sparkling clean floor. The knights stared at the bright room in admiration. \u201cCleaning a place with your own hands makes living there that much more satisfying, you see.\u201d\nThe knights smiled their awkward but good-natured agreement.\nRishe worked tirelessly, and before long, the chambers where she would spend the night were ready. The knights offered to carry in the bed, which she allowed.\nWhile they brought in furniture, Rishe started cleaning another room. She had run out of clean water, so she quietly slipped out to the well without informing the knights. It wasn\u2019t quite fair to them, but these were the palace grounds. Surely she didn\u2019t need to be chaperoned everywhere.\nBesides, they\u2019re guards in name only. They\u2019re clearly just here to report my movements to Arnold Hein, Rishe reflected as she walked through a courtyard full of flowers, bucket in hand. Iridescent butterflies cavorted playfully around her feet. He doesn\u2019t seem in a hurry to introduce me to the king. Although if I\u2019m just a hostage, that doesn\u2019t surprise me.\nShe hoped she got to meet the current emperor at least once. The future Arnold\u2019s violent conquest only began after he killed the man and made himself emperor, after all.\nI wonder what happened to Arnold Hein after I died in my past life. Did he reign supreme after winning his war? Or did some country manage to put a stop to his conquest? Whatever the case, I absolutely cannot allow him to start a conflict this time. Being the empress of a wartime nation sounds like so much work! The very thought is unacceptable!\nPerhaps they could divorce, but Rishe had a feeling that if Arnold decided to discard her in the middle of a war, she would fail in her mission to make it past the age of twenty. Better to avoid the situation all together.\nWait. When she thought about it, the cause of every single one of Rishe\u2019s deaths was Arnold and his war. I died fighting. I died when Galkhein\u2019s army invaded\u2026\nLooking at her six lives, all of them had ended in more or less the same way.\nRishe found herself crouched on the ground, cradling her head in her hands. Maybe we should get a divorce right now. But it wasn\u2019t in Rishe\u2019s nature to take back her decisions once she\u2019d made them. \nIf I leave, I\u2019ll probably just die in some war-related disaster again. If I can\u2019t live apart from him, I should take this opportunity to learn everything that I can. \nRishe didn\u2019t know the cause of her repeating lives, but there was no guarantee that the loops were infinite. She had to operate under the possibility that this life could be her last. This required some thought, but standing around seething with anxiety wouldn\u2019t help.\nRight now I\u2019ll focus on cleaning. Once the bath is here, I\u2019ll scrub off all the dust and travel exhaustion. And then I can finally relax! \nBrimming with new determination, she stood up and headed for the well. She was forestalled by the sound of jeering giggles. \n\u201cAww, look at the new girl, trying so hard,\u201d said one voice.\n\u201cAll the enthusiasm in the world won\u2019t make a difference,\u201d said another. \u201cWe\u2019re going to be the crown princess\u2019s maids, not you.\u201d\nThe first added, \u201cHey, are you even listening? Stop wasting your time!\u201d\nRishe heard a weak scream, followed by a thump, like a body hitting the ground. She broke into a run, finding a blonde girl sprawled in the dirt, surrounded by four other women.\n\u201cAre you all right?\u201d Rishe hurried over to help the girl up. Her maid\u2019s uniform\u2014a loose navy-blue dress with a white apron\u2014was smeared with mud. The others were dressed identically.\n\u201cWho are you?\u201d one of the girls snapped at Rishe. She had a mop of blazing-red hair. \u201cAnother newbie?\u201d\nAn understandable mistake. Rishe\u2019s dress was simple, free of ornamentation, and her hair was bound back in a ponytail to keep it out of the way. She was dust-streaked, sweaty, and carrying a bucket in her arms.\nTelling them who I am will be more trouble than it\u2019s worth. Her silence only angered the girls more.\n\u201cAre you one of the crown princess\u2019s maids? They\u2019ve been snatching up every new girl. Those pretty hands of yours don\u2019t look like they\u2019ve ever held a broom,\u201d said one of them.\n\u201cUnfortunately for you, we\u2019ve been working here three years, and we\u2019ll be the ones to serve Prince Arnold as the maids of his palace.\u201d\n\u201cCan you stand? Oh, good, it looks like you\u2019re not injured.\u201d Rishe helped the girl up out of the dirt. \n\u201cHey, don\u2019t ignore us!\u201d the redheaded maid shouted. \u201cYou\u2019ve got some nerve. If you want to make it here, you\u2019ll know your place! I doubt the two of you will last a week!\u201d\nRishe didn\u2019t respond, her attention snagging on something else. The redhead was carrying curtains, probably to bring them to the wash. Rishe stared at them so hard the maid began to shift uncomfortably. \u201cWhat\u2019s your problem?\u201d\n\u201cYou should wait to wash those,\u201d Rishe said.\nThe girl glared daggers at her. \u201cExcuse me? Are you telling me it\u2019s too late in the day? You really are an amateur! The light lasts longer in the spring, you know. And it\u2019s hot today. There\u2019ll be plenty of\u2014\u201d \n\u201cIt\u2019s going to rain, is all.\u201d\nThe maids exchanged glances. \u201cHow can you be so sure?\u201d\n\u201cLook at the clouds amassing. The butterflies and the bees are flying low. The moisture in the air will make the drying take longer.\u201d\n\u201cWhat?\u201d\nAnother maid spoke up in a soft voice. \u201cDiana, you were the one who said we should take the initiative to wash the bigger pieces. You said the crown prince would choose us for his household!\u201d\n\u201cStop putting the blame on me! This isn\u2019t my fault.\u201d An indignant flush crept over the redhead\u2019s face. \u201cThere\u2019s no way some upstart can tell what time it\u2019s going to rain! The weather is going to be fantastic all day. Come on, we\u2019re hauling these over to the wash!\u201d\nThe three girls meekly followed Diana.\nRishe sighed, turning to the blonde girl. \u201cAre you hurt?\u201d\n\u201cNo, I\u2019m fine.\u201d The girl\u2019s gaze darted around nervously. \u201cI\u2019m Elsie. Thank you for helping me.\u201d Her face was studiously blank, but from the way she struggled with her words, Rishe could tell she was being genuine.\n\u201cDon\u2019t worry about it,\u201d Rishe said. \u201cYour uniform seems to have fared less well.\u201d\n\u201cOh no.\u201d Elsie looked down at herself. Her face remained vacant, but she seemed sad. \u201cAnd I just got it.\u201d \n\u201cYou can get the dirt out if you wash it straight away. It\u2019s going to rain, but this dress should dry quickly. Use lots of soap, but don\u2019t scrub it by hand\u2014scrape the mud off with a brush.\u201d\n\u201cWhy a brush?\u201d\n\u201cBecause your fingers will just grind dirt into the threads. A brush is more porous.\u201d\nThe young sons of the family Rishe served spent their time tumbling in the dirt, and she had plenty of experience scraping mud out of clothes. She could even salvage dirty socks that had spent days crumpled in the corner.\n\u201cDo you\u2026 Are you\u2026\u201d Elsie trailed off, blinking rapidly a couple of times before finally looking Rishe in the eyes. \u201cAre you the crown princess\u2019s maid?\u201d\nUnsure how to answer, Rishe couldn\u2019t meet her eyes.\n \n***\n \nAfter parting ways with Elsie, Rishe returned to the detached wing with her fresh water. She put clean sheets on the bed the knights had installed, satisfied that she had a comfortable place to sleep. This room also had the highest-up balcony in the whole detached palace.\nTaking a break, she wandered out onto the",
    "query_text": " balcony and looked off over the capital, the golden afternoon tinged with the onset of twilight. The day was fresh with a recent rain, the air clear enough to see for miles. The spring breeze felt good against her skin, sweaty from cleaning. Rishe leaned against the railing, leaning her head back and closing her eyes.\nShe felt like collapsing into bed immediately, but she desperately needed a wash. Still, she didn\u2019t want to pull herself away from the view and the breeze just yet. When she resumed gazing out absentmindedly, something her mother once said drifted back to her. \n\u201cRishe, there is no need for you to think for yourself.\u201d\nShe frowned, the memories coming thick and fast now.\n\u201cYou mustn\u2019t forget that the duty of our family is to live our lives fully devoted to the kings of the land. You\u2019re smart"

We\u2019ve been climbing through mountains of paperwork, but never mind me. His Highness has been working around the clock.\u201d\nRishe thought back to yesterday, how he had come all the way out to the balcony. He should have used that spare time to sleep. \u201cHe\u2019s in high demand, isn\u2019t he? He was even working on the trip over.\u201d\n\u201cHe finished all the work he brought along with us,\u201d Oliver confirmed. \u201cNow he\u2019s dealing with everything that piled up during his visit to Hermity.\u201d\n\u201cOh.\u201d Rishe grimaced in sympathy. He may have killed her in a past life, but she wouldn\u2019t wish the bureaucracy of kingship on anyone. \u201cIt\u2019s a shame he had to put his work on hold to attend a silly engagement party.\u201d\n\u201cNo matter. That party was how a committed bachelor finally found a bride.\u201d\nHis smile was sincere, but Rishe knew better. She spread her arms. \u201cGo on. Shall I spin around so you have a better view?\u201d\nOliver blinked. \u201cI beg your pardon?\u201d\n\u201cYou\u2019re looking me over like I\u2019m a horse for sale. If there\u2019s anything I can help you with, please let me know.\u201d\nOliver\u2019s brows went up. He let out a little breath of resignation. \u201cHis Highness was right. You do possess the keen perception of a knight. Of course, I\u2019m purely an amateur myself.\u201d\nI\u2019d say this was a merchant\u2019s sixth sense, rather than battle intuition.\nThis wasn\u2019t the first time Rishe had caught Oliver looking at her. It reminded her of the way her noble customers would examine a product, assessing worth and authenticity. Or a merchant weeding out potential merchandise from a wide array of choices.\nIn other words, he was appraising her.\nOliver moved into a deep, sweeping bow. \u201cMy sincerest apologies, my lady. I have been unaccountably rude to my lord\u2019s consort. My behavior was unacceptable.\u201d\nRishe shook her head. \u201cPlease don\u2019t, it\u2019s fine.\u201d It wasn\u2019t unreasonable for the prince\u2019s closest attendant to be wary of strangers. But it did make her curious. \u201cHow long have you worked for Arnold? Have you always been a valet?\u201d\n\u201cI trained as a squire, actually,\u201d Oliver replied. \u201cBut I was injured and dismissed from the order. His Highness took me into his household soon after. I have served him for nearly a decade.\u201d\n\u201cThen maybe you can answer this,\u201d Rishe said. \u201cWhy is Prince Arnold so very intent on making me his wife?\u201d\nOliver hesitated, as if weighing the pros and cons of speaking, \u201cTo be quite honest, I was as surprised as you were. He\u2019s always insisted he had no interest in marriage. But the sight of you in Hermity has changed his mind. Apparently.\u201d\nSo not even his attendant understood his motives. Rishe remained at a complete loss.\n\u201cIf I may, however?\u201d Oliver mistook Rishe\u2019s confusion for anxiety and added, \u201cI have served Prince Arnold for a long time, and never before have I seen him so happy. When he is with you, he laughs. His smiles are sincere.\u201d\nRishe was taken aback. She\u2019d figured all of Arnold\u2019s laughter and teasing was at her expense. His own private jokes.\n\u201cAre you\u2026unhappy with him?\u201d Oliver ventured. \u201cWith his looks, His Highness is exceedingly popular with the ladies of the court, you know.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m sure he has many admirers.\u201d She paused. \u201cWould you really call the way he acts around me \u2018happy\u2019? To me, it seems more like a cat with a mouse.\u201d\nOliver laughed. He didn\u2019t deny it. \u201cI am pleased you understand His Highness so well. Oh, I nearly forgot. Here.\u201d\nHe held out a sheaf of three documents. \u201cThis is the guest list for your wedding. His Highness bids you look over it.\u201d\n\u201cThank you,\u201d Rishe said, pleasantly surprised. She hadn\u2019t even needed to ask. She gave it a quick glance, quickly identifying the most prominent and powerful names.\nKing Zahad, Prince Kyle, Princess Harriet. And from the Kingdom of Domana, we have Lord Jonal attending as the representative of the king. No surprise there.\nMore than a wedding guest register, this was a list of key people from the countries Arnold would go on to antagonize. Even before the murder of the king and the start of the war, there must have been a trigger\u2014a sea change in the affairs of state. Everyone on this list was most likely involved.\nKing Zahad. I hope we can be friends again like in my first life. Hmm\u2026 Prince Kyle is rather frail. I hope he isn\u2019t working himself too hard. He has a strong sense of responsibility\u2014he\u2019ll attend the wedding even though it\u2019ll be a long trip.\nThe sight of these names filled Rishe with a longing for those lives, for the people she\u2019d once known. And sometime in the very near future, they would all be Galkhein\u2019s enemies.\nIf I take matters into my own hands, perhaps I can salvage some of these relationships before they sour. Even if we aren\u2019t allies, we don\u2019t have to be enemies. Anything to stave off the outbreak of war.\nOliver had no idea what was going through Rishe\u2019s head. Brightly, he continued their conversation. \u201cThe ceremony will be held in three months\u2019 time. All preparations must be complete by then. And now\u2026we need to discuss tonight\u2019s party.\u201d\n\u201cTonight\u2019s what?\u201d\nOliver stiffened. \u201cDid His Highness not tell you?\u201d\n\u201cNo, he most certainly did not! There\u2019s to be a party?\u201d\n\u201cUgh, not again!\u201d Oliver dug his knuckles into his forehead.\nRishe put two and two together. She hesitated, then said, \u201cSo there is one, then. As you must know, His Highness is trying to stamp it down without telling me.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d Oliver replied. \u201cHe should have mentioned it to you. You don\u2019t need to attend, but he will. At least, I hope he will. I think I managed to convince him.\u201d\nShe sympathized with Oliver. Under normal circumstances, it would be unheard of for the crown prince and his fianc\u00e9e to fail to appear at a banquet. \u201cDon\u2019t worry, Oliver. I\u2019ll go.\u201d\nOliver let out a sigh of relief. \u201cReally? Thank you so much, my lady. I\u2019ll put finding you a maid at the top of my to-do list.\u201d\n\u201cNo need.\u201d Rishe smiled. \u201cI can prepare for the party on my own.\u201d\nThis maid-selection process made Rishe uneasy. After witnessing that exchange between the servants in the garden, she imagined quarrels breaking out all through the palace. And she doubted the disputes would go away even after they decided.\nOliver frowned. \u201cBut won\u2019t dressing be difficult without a lady\u2019s maid?\u201d \nShe shook her head. \u201cI can do my hair and put on a gown by myself. I brought dresses and cosmetics from home. Don\u2019t worry.\u201d\nRishe ignored Oliver\u2019s stunned look, already reevaluating her cleaning plans.\n \n***\n \nThe first thing Rishe said to Arnold that night was, \u201cYour Highness, I have a request.\u201d Her gown rustled as she leaned in close. \u201cI would like some herb seed and a corner of the gardens. I made a list. I hope we can discuss this in more detail later.\u201d\nArnold was silent a moment. \u201cRishe.\u201d\n\u201cWhat? Didn\u2019t you tell me to let you know if there was anything I wanted?\u201d She looked at him quizzically, and Arnold sighed.\nShe\u2019d heard that he\u2019d finished his mountain of work and even managed to sleep for a while. He was dressed in his usual military black, trimmed with a red mantle and black gloves.\nArnold shook his head. \u201cThat\u2019s not what I mean. I\u2019m guessing that Oliver didn\u2019t tell you the reason for this party? It\u2019s merely for appearance\u2019s sake. I need to look like I\u2019m searching for a bride within our borders as well. There\u2019s no reason for you to attend.\u201d\nIt made sense. The crown prince\u2014the greatest catch in the kingdom\u2014marrying a foreigner without even the slightest nod to propriety would invite unwanted discontent from the nobility.\n\u201cHowever, we\u2019re betrothed,\u201d Arnold said. \u201cThis whole evening is merely a formality. And with news that you\u2019re my \u2018hostage\u2019 going around, you\u2019ll be an object of curiosity. I don\u2019t want to put you through that.\u201d\n\u201cWell, I already went to the trouble of getting ready.\u201d Rishe plucked at her soft blue dress, draped in fluttering layers around her like a flower bud. She\u2019d braided her hair, decorating it with accessories. Her makeup was light, her shoes polished to a mirror shine. Her only jewelry was a pair of pearl earrings.\n\u201cRishe\u2026\u201d\n\u201cYour Highness, the court may consider my status as a captive princess shameful in the extreme, but I don\u2019t.\u201d She\u2019d chosen this course, after all.\nArnold was again watching her with a mixture of wonder and confusion.\n\u201cSo don\u2019t worry,\u201d she said, extending her hand. \u201cFeel free to show off your fianc\u00e9e.\u201d\nArnold relented, his dashing smile creeping out once again. \u201cVery well. I should take advantage of this opportunity to touch my betrothed.\u201d\n\u201cWe\u2019re wearing gloves.\u201d\nArnold took Rishe\u2019s hand.\nA throng of guests was gathered in the ballroom as a group of musicians performed on a platform. Women in gowns stood clustered, while gentlemen in military attire grouped together. A mere glance was enough to tell their clothes were of the highest quality. They mingled happily, making small talk with glasses in hand.\nRishe let her hand rest on Arnold\u2019s arm as she paused at the threshold to take it all in. \u201cThis is a bigger event than I was expecting.\u201d\n\u201cIs it? I\u2019d say it\u2019s a rather small gathering, actually.\u201d\n\u201cMaybe for a military powerhouse,\u201d Rishe muttered. \nYet another reminder of Galkhein\u2019s wealth took her off guard. Arnold just looked bored.\n\u201cThe size doesn\u2019t matter,\u201d he said. \u201cIn the end, they\u2019re only here for gossip. Look, here they come.\u201d\nIn the blink of an eye, they were surrounded by guests.\n\u201cPrince Arnold, thank you for gracing us with an invitation,\u201d said one man. \u201cSuch a pleasure.\u201d \n\u201cThe pleasure is mine, Lord Abel,\u201d Arnold drawled.\n\u201cYour Highness! We were so glad to hear of your safe return,\u201d another guest chirped. \u201cPlease, our daughter is simply dying to be regaled with tales of your trip.\u201d\n\u201cI can\u2019t imagine I\u2019d have anything particularly exciting to share with her,\u201d Arnold said curtly.\nAfter the last few days, Rishe found this look of glazed apathy disturbing. His good looks only compounded it\u2014he was so handsome that every expression was stark.\nHe looks more like Emperor Arnold Hein now, but still not the same.\nArnold appeared to notice her watching him. When he looked at her, his sourness disappeared, replaced by a genuine smile. All around him, women found themselves flushing. Arnold paid no heed to their fervent gazes, instead leaning in to give Rishe a brief moment of consideration.\nThen he leaned in close enough to kiss her.\n\u201cA dull trip,\u201d he said again, pulling away. \u201cBut fortuitous. Without it, I",
    "query_text": " would have never met the woman destined to be my wife.\u201d\nA shocked murmur rolled through the crowd. Rishe, who hadn\u2019t recovered from seeing Arnold\u2019s beautiful face at close range, barely noticed the looks of utter loathing the assembled women were throwing her.\n\u201cH-His Highness is smiling? At his hostage bride?\u201d\n\u201cHe called her his wife?! He\u2019s never even looked at us!\u201d\nThey were whispers, but they carried.\nA portly man stepped forward with his daughter in tow. \u201cYour Highness, do you mean to say that this lovely young woman is your fianc\u00e9e?\u201d\nEvery eye in the ballroom was on Rishe, alight with curiosity, envy, or schemes. None of them could hide their contempt. But Rishe didn\u2019t falter.\nThis is nothing compared to being publicly dumped in a banquet hall. And I\u2019ve done"

    "prefix_text": " you\u2019re empty-handed.\u201d\nA gaggle of other ladies nearby began giggling among themselves.\n\u201cHow dare she act so haughty when she\u2019s a captive. It\u2019s time for her learn just what she is. A pawn to be played and discarded.\u201d\n\u201cShe should enjoy her time on Prince Arnold\u2019s arm while she can.\u201d\n\u201cShe is from a minor nation, after all.\u201d\nAs Rishe took note of their whispers, Cornelia gazed at her with doe eyes. \u201cDoes my offering offend you in some way?\u201d\nIf I remember correctly, House Toona holds a vast territory in southern Galkhein.\nRishe held out a hand to accept the glass. \u201cHow could it? Thank you, Lady Cornelia.\u201d\nBefore Rishe could touch the glass, Cornelia gave a dramatic shout. \u201cOh dear! My hand slipped!\u201d She dropped it, quite obviously on purpose. Without thinking, Rishe grabbed her skirts and leaned back, plucking the glass out of the air with the other hand.\nCornelia let out a cry of surprise as Rishe caught the wine before any could spill. She swirled the glass and brought it to her nose to breathe in the bouquet.\nHmm\u2026 That\u2019s mashed capsicum. Where did she even get that? What a waste of perfectly good wine. And why bother spicing it enough to singe the tongue if she just planned to ruin my dress? Pick a plan, my dear.\nHiding her exasperation, Rishe smiled brightly. \u201cI\u2019ve never had a wine quite like this. What an unusual scent.\u201d\nCornelia bit her lip in frustration. Rishe beamed at her. You\u2019ve got such a pretty face, Lady Toona. Why don\u2019t you smile?\nRishe leaned in close to Cornelia. \u201cThis vintage isn\u2019t available where I\u2019m from. I\u2019m ever so anxious to learn more. Should I perhaps invite Prince Arnold over to enjoy a glass? Which tray did you get this from?\u201d\n\u201cWhat? Oh, um\u2026\u201d Rishe had a policy of never backing down from a fight, but it seemed Cornelia didn\u2019t share it. \u201cS-sorry, but I don\u2019t remember. Such a large hall, you see.\u201d\n\u201cA shame. I\u2019ll just give His Highness this one, then. I\u2019ll be sure to let him know who it\u2019s from.\u201d\n\u201cUh, wait!\u201d Cornelia rapidly shook her head. \u201cI-I got that glass for you, so I think you should\u2014you know what? Never mind! Maybe I should just take that\u2014oh no!\u201d\nRishe ignored the ashen-faced Cornelia, raising the glass and swallowing down a gulp. \n\u201cI-I can\u2019t believe\u2026\u201d\n\u201cSuch a spicy flavor, just as I imagined.\u201d Rishe smiled again to the assembled group\u2019s astonishment. \u201cWhat a warm welcome. I do hope the two of us can spend more time together. Perhaps\u2026a tea party?\u201d\n\u201cTh-the two of us?\u201d Cornelia stammered.\n\u201cYes. I want to know all about House Toona.\u201d\nCornelia looked flabbergasted, but she recovered herself and nodded.\nThat should do. One of Rishe\u2019s eventual plans required a plot of land in a temperate climate. House Toona\u2019s would likely be perfect, but she needed to confirm a few things with Cornelia. Never back down from a fight. Even further\u2026\nShe recalled the words of her mentor from her days as a merchant.\nDon\u2019t bother with fights you can\u2019t win.\nThe other ladies fled, fearful of this strange girl who gulped down painfully spicy wine like it was nothing. \n \n***\n \nRishe retreated to the empty balcony to enjoy the music, grimacing with every stinging mouthful of wine. She drank it in decreasing sips until Arnold joined her.\n\u201cWhat are you making that face for?\u201d\nRishe swirled the glass. \u201cDon\u2019t worry, it\u2019s not you. It\u2019s just this wine is so spicy.\u201d\n\u201cSpicy? The wine is?\u201d\n\u201cMm. It\u2019s seasoned with capsicum. I barely managed to get that first mouthful down without gagging.\u201d\nArnold swiped the glass from her hand. \u201cDon\u2019t tell me this was a poisoning attempt!\u201d\nRishe clicked her tongue in annoyance at her own lack of vigilance. No one else would be able to grab something from her so easily.\nArnold glared at the wine. \u201cYou don\u2019t need to drink this. I\u2019ll get rid of it.\u201d\n\u201cHey, give that back! They ruined a perfectly good glass of wine because of me. I\u2019m not going to waste it.\u201d She grabbed it back and took another sip, shuddering at the taste.\nArnold glowered. \u201cTell me who did this. I\u2019ll have them executed.\u201d\n\u201cDon\u2019t be ridiculous. You don\u2019t kill people like her\u2014you use them.\u201d Just the tiniest bit of wine to go, but it was getting harder to make herself drink it. She gave the glass a reproachful look, then glanced back at Arnold. \u201cOh, and I owe you an apology.\u201d\n\u201cDo you?\u201d\n\u201cI used your name to defend myself.\u201d The girls had only backed off when she threatened to tattle to Arnold. Rishe found that sort of thing inelegant in the extreme, and she was embarrassed.\nArnold sighed at Rishe\u2019s apologetic bow. \u201cThere\u2019s nothing wrong with a wife invoking her husband\u2019s name.\u201d\nRishe hesitated. \u201cWe\u2019re not married yet.\u201d\n\u201cThat\u2019s a formality. It\u2019s as good as done, if you ask me.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2026see.\u201d\nHe took her distraction as an opportunity to swipe her glass back. Instead of dumping it out, Arnold gulped the rest of it down. \n\u201cDamn, that packs a punch,\u201d he grumbled.\n\u201cI told you that!\u201d Rishe snapped. \u201cAre you all right? Let me get you some water!\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m fine. But now you\u2019ve fulfilled your obligation to the wine, haven\u2019t you?\u201d\nRishe didn\u2019t know what to say. He\u2019d helped her\u2014not by taking charge but by following her lead. Without cutting her down and telling her she was being foolish. Without rolling his eyes and dismissing her desires as trifles.\n\u201cThank you,\u201d Rishe said stiffly, which just made him laugh.\n\u201cWhat were you thinking about when we were dancing?\u201d he asked.\n\u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d\n\u201cYou were thinking about someone else, weren\u2019t you? Who?\u201d\nRishe didn\u2019t know a delicate way to say I was thinking about a future version of you I met in another life.\n\u201cHmm?\u201d His tone was oddly light, teasing even. But the gleam in his hunter\u2019s eyes said she wouldn\u2019t get away so easily.\nObviously, Rishe couldn\u2019t give him an honest answer. \u201cI wasn\u2019t thinking about anyone else. I was worried about you.\u201d\n\u201cWhy?\u201d\nThis was the closest she could come to the truth. \u201cWere you injured here?\u201d She patted her own left shoulder with her forefinger. \nArnold went silent. His left shoulder was slightly slower to react than his right\u2014if his right was at one hundred, then his left was at maybe ninety-eight. It was hardly noticeable, but Rishe had picked up on it. He was right-handed, and she wouldn\u2019t have noticed it if they\u2019d been dancing normally. \nThat, and if it hadn\u2019t been for memories from her past life.\nRishe had only managed to inflict a single injury on him. An instant, a moment\u2019s hesitation where she saw her chance and slashed left. Of course, he\u2019d shrugged off the injury and effortlessly run her through. \n\u201cHeh.\u201d Arnold finally broke his silence with grim laughter. His eyes sent shivers down her spine, cold and bewitching. In lieu of an answer, he reached for his collar, unfastening the clasp with a snap and drawing his jacket open with a rough tug.\nOh my.\nRishe drew in a breath. A great scar was engraved into the nape of his neck, just low enough to be concealed by clothing. It looked several years old. \u201cIt\u2019s an old wound. It continues to the top of my shoulder and pulls the skin taut.\u201d\n\u201cHow awful.\u201d Rishe couldn\u2019t help but reach out to gingerly touch the nape of his neck.\nArnold accepted her touch without a word. She\u2019d half expected to be slapped aside.\nHer fingers slowly traced the shape of it. She could feel the rough skin through her gloves.\nHe must have gotten this over a decade ago. Someone stabbed him\u2014and not just once or twice. They must have done it over and over to make this scar pattern.\nHer medical training had her shuddering at the image of a nine-year-old Arnold ashen and trembling with blood loss. The fact that he\u2019d survived and retained the use of his arm was incredible. And then to go on to wield a sword so skillfully\u2014his suffering must have been immense.\n\u201cOnly a few people know about this injury. You\u2019re the first to notice on your own.\u201d\n\u201cHow did it happen?\u201d\nThat grim smile returned as he looked down at Rishe. With the moon hanging behind him, he was as opaque as ever, but Rishe understood the sentiment.\nI shouldn\u2019t pry.\nRishe pulled her hand away, and that ominous smile that sent chills down her spine disappeared. Arnold put his jacket back in order, reclasping it at the neck.\nSomeone tried to kill Arnold Hein about ten years ago. But who and why? Rishe cast her eyes down as she ruminated. The most obvious beneficiaries of a dead crown prince would be potential heirs and those loyal to them. I believe Arnold has a younger brother, but I haven\u2019t met him yet.\nOdd. Rishe might be a hostage, but shouldn\u2019t she meet her future relatives? Perhaps it was Arnold\u2019s doing and not the will of the imperial family themselves. He didn\u2019t seem to want to involve her in anything unless it was absolutely necessary\u2014he hadn\u2019t told her about this ball, after all. \nRishe looked up at him. \u201cYour Highness, may I select my maids some time over the next few days?\u201d \n\u201cVery well. I\u2019ll tell Oliver to make that a priority.\u201d\n\u201cAh, I can do the selection myself. We needn\u2019t trouble him.\u201d\nArnold arched an amused brow. Gone was that unsettling smile, replaced with his easy manner. \u201cWhat are you planning this time?\u201d\n\u201cOh, nothing important,\u201d Rishe said. She picked up her empty glass. \u201cI\u2019m merely concerned about the servants\u2019 working conditions.\u201d\nTo protect her life and well-being, she needed to keep from dying at twenty years old again. And to do that, she had to prevent Arnold Hein\u2019s war. Her best bet would be to appeal to the important people she\u2019d known in her past lives. People with influence.\nPlus, there was a mountain of things she needed to do in preparation for the marriage ceremony.\nI need to sow a plot of land, grow herbs, do lots of shopping, get cheap alcohol, and then\u2026 \nRishe began a to-do list that had nothing to do with war in the least.\n \n***\n \nAs the ball wound to a close, a lone boy stood in the gloomy courtyard of the imperial palace. He had soft black hair and round blue eyes. No older than sixteen, he had an androgynous grace to him, gaze fixed on the balcony above. \nHe was watching a girl.\nShe had coral-colored hair, and even from this distance, he could tell she was beautiful. She stood there alone, apparently waiting for someone. Whoever it was must have shown up because her hand slipped from the banister, and she stepped away. Not too long after, a man appeared where she had been standing.\nThe man turned a silent glare down into the garden, as if he\u2019d known the boy had been there the whole time, despite the shadows.\nA shiver ran down the boy\u2019s spine and he smiled reflexively, delighting in the intense aura of threat the man gave off. It was just a warning, it seemed, as the man abruptly turned on his heel and disappeared. \n\u201cAww, we can\u2019t play together either?\u201d The boy hung his head. \u201cI miss you, Brother.\u201d\nIt had to be the woman. The beauty. She\u2019d made the boy\u2019s life hell since the day she arrived. \nHis brother had prohibited him from attending balls like this one. That was fine; he\u2019d sooner avoid them altogether. Still, he\u2019d wanted to meet that girl. \n\u201cBut we\u2019ll meet soon enough, won\u2019t we?\u201d He spoke to himself in a soft voice. \u201cI\u2019ve got plans for you, Sister.\u201d \n\n(2) chapter number given is likely out of range: 0\nChapter: 8\n\nChapter 3\nChapter 3\n \n\u201cYOU\u2019RE ALL SO USELESS!\u201d Diana the redheaded maid\u2019s voice rang out inside the stone washhouse. \nThree days had passed since the afternoon Rishe shook off her guard and came out to the well. Rishe was once again dressed to fit in with the maids. At Diana\u2019s shout, she looked up without pausing in her work. \n\u201cIs even laundry beyond your capabilities? I asked you to wash these this morning, and now it\u2019s past noon! Meanwhile, we\u2019ve finished cleaning the entire first floor in a third of the time!\u201d\n\u201cI-I\u2019m sorry, Diana.\u201d\nThe new maids went silent with shame. Among them was Elsie, the girl Rishe stood up for the other day. Rishe pulled her hands out of the soapy water, gently rinsed them, and said, \u201cLet me help. What still needs to be done?\u201d\n\u201cYou again?\u201d Diana rounded on Rishe. \u201cI don\u2019t know who you serve, but I\u2019m amazed you have the time to do other people\u2019s work. I wish I had so much free time.\u201d\nHuffily, she turned from Rishe. \u201cLet\u2019s just ignore these useless fools. Laura, Maya. Come on. If we want to be chosen as Lady Rishe\u2019s maids, we mustn\u2019t waste our time.\u201d\nDiana took out a slip of paper from her pocket, smoothing it out. \u201c",
    "query_text": "It looks like the new bedsheets for her palace will arrive today. We should inspect them to make sure everything is perfect!\u201d\n\u201cWait up, Diana!\u201d\nThe two maids followed Diana out. Rishe waited for the door to close before turning to Elsie and the others. \u201cLet\u2019s keep working. If there\u2019s anything too large and cumbersome, feel free to pass it over to me.\u201d\n\u201cTh-thank you so much!\u201d The new maids went weak with gratitude. One of them, a girl on the verge of tears, even fell into a full bow. Rishe muttered encouragement as she scrubbed some bedsheets.\nElsie, who was washing the sheets with her, wore a rueful look. \u201cI\u2019m so sorry for the trouble. We\u2019re just not learning fast enough.\u201d\n\u201cYou haven\u2019t been working here long, have you? It takes time to learn a new job, no matter who you"

Her gaze darted around as if looking for help.\nPulling herself together, she forced herself to follow Rishe\u2019s directions. She thought back and finally alighted on a response. \u201cI\u2026I didn\u2019t know how to do the job. Before, when my family was still prominent, I\u2019d washed shirts and bedsheets. Never gowns or military uniforms.\u201d\n\u201cPerfectly reasonable,\u201d Rishe said. \u201cOnly natural for someone just starting out.\u201d\n\u201cThe older girls were so busy, they told me to just watch them since they didn\u2019t have time to teach me. When I had questions\u2026well, there was nobody to ask.\u201d\n\u201cI bet. And did you have any other problems?\u201d\n\u201cWell, yes. There was a lot to learn. Different kinds of soap and washboards depending on the cloth. You use different tools for different materials. I had to learn how they worked and how to put them away. I was\u2026punished if I didn\u2019t get it right the first time.\u201d\nThe newcomers were exchanging surprised looks. Rishe understood why.\nEverything Diana said was familiar to them. They spent valuable time searching for their materials and the proper ways to use them, but they shrank from asking for help. Everyone always looked so busy. This was a universal problem.\n\u201cDespite all that, I got better!\u201d Diana protested. \u201cI only needed to be taught once. Unlike them! They\u2019re useless!\u201d\n\u201cYes, well. There\u2019s a difference between you and them,\u201d Rishe told Diana. \u201cYou can read and write.\u201d\n\u201cOh!\u201d Diana started in surprise. Elsie looked at the floor.\nThe literacy rate among commoners was low no matter where you went. Very few families had the means to afford an education, especially for daughters. Diana had been born to a merchant\u2019s family\u2014she\u2019d received formal schooling. The maids she was close friends with were likely from similar backgrounds. The majority of those in service were not so fortunate.\n\u201cWhat if you only received instructions on how to do a job once and weren\u2019t able to write it down to remind yourself later?\u201d Rishe asked. \u201cWould you be so confident?\u201d\n\u201cI-I don\u2019t\u2014\u201d Diana reflexively thrust a hand into her apron pocket, where she had a list of daily tasks recorded in her neat handwriting to reference throughout the day. Hopefully now she would understand how much of an edge her privileged literacy gave her over the other maids.\n\u201cEveryone else works as hard as they can, just like you do,\u201d Rishe said. \u201cRemember how it was for you at first? They all have to start somewhere. I hope you\u2019ll keep that in mind.\u201d\n\u201cThey\u2019re no different from me,\u201d Diana mumbled begrudgingly, glancing around the room, looking at the less experienced maids. As if coming to a decision, she said, \u201cI\u2019m sorry.\u201d\n\u201cDiana?\u201d\nLike a child enumerating her regrets, Diana went on, \u201cI\u2019ve done you wrong, all of you. It\u2019s just, I had nothing. Or so it felt like. No money, no title. I thought I had to make my way in the world on my own. That I had to start from zero.\u201d Her shoulders trembled as she buried her face in her hands. \u201cBut I was wrong! I wasn\u2019t starting from zero. I had everything that I learned growing up. I didn\u2019t realize how fortunate I was. I let it all go to my he\n \n\u201cRISHE IRMGARD WEITZNER! You are a vile woman! A truly malicious creature unworthy of the crown prince! As of this instant, our engagement is off!\u201d \n\u201cAs you wish, Your Highness.\u201d\n\u201c\u2026Huh?\u201d\nThe prince\u2019s declaration echoed throughout the ballroom. Rishe, the duke\u2019s daughter, bowed in response, her coral-toned hair swaying gracefully. The assembled guests found themselves captivated by her dignified beauty. Despite having just witnessed a broken engagement, they couldn\u2019t bring themselves to pity her.\nSlowly, Rishe lifted her head and fixed the prince with a pale-emerald gaze. It caught him off guard, but he quickly recovered.\n\u201cDidn\u2019t you hear what I just said?! I\u2019m calling off our engagement! Doesn\u2019t that trouble you?\u201d\n\u201cNot really.\u201d\nRishe already knew what happened next: false accusations, exile, and her family severing all ties and leaving her to survive on her own. She turned from the prince. There was no point wasting any time.\nThis is my seventh loop, after all.\nRishe had done this all before.\nThe next few hours will be busy. I must hurry and retrieve my things before I\u2019m barred from the family estate. I don\u2019t want this to be one of the times I\u2019m too slow and I have to start my new life with nothing.\n\u201cRishe, halt and hear me! I have spent the past week perfecting my recitation of your crimes!\u201d\nI should take more than dresses this time\u2014there\u2019s plenty of things I could use out in the world. What trade should I take up? In my first life, I was a merchant. In my second, an apothecary. I\u2019ve got a few more I want to try out\u2026 Augh! If time\u2019s just going to keep resetting, I wish I could start at an earlier point. I need more time to prepare!\n\u201cWait! Rishe!\u201d\nThe crown prince was on the verge of tears, and the spectators struggled to suppress their snickers. \nA thought occurred to Rishe, and she stopped. She then turned, her eyes gleaming beneath long lashes as she stared down her ex-fianc\u00e9. \u201cAh, Your Highness, I almost forgot.\u201d \n\u201cYes, tell me!\u201d the prince fumed. \u201cLet me guess, you are hurt beyond measure and yet love me still\u2026correct?\u201d\nAs if. Rishe was grateful to be granted her freedom. In fact, she was smiling as she said, \u201cI hope you and Lady Mary are happy together.\u201d\n\u201cWhat?!\u201d\n\u201cMay we both lead fulfilling lives. Farewell!\u201d Rishe lifted the skirts of her evening gown and turned on her heel, departing as briskly as she could.\n\u201cHow do you know about Mary? I haven\u2019t told you I love her!\u201d The prince was shouting something behind her, but she paid him no mind. She had things to do.\nDuring her first loop, the prince\u2019s accusations had shocked her to the core and she\u2014foolishly so\u2014had attempted to defend herself. Now she knew better than to expect the prince to behave reasonably. \nHow will life unfold this time? I\u2019m excited to find out! Rishe fixed her mind on the future.\nThis is my seventh \u201cdo-over.\u201d I\u2019ve led happy and carefree lives before, but this time\u2014this time, I swear I\u2019ll live a long happy and carefree life!\nIn other words, she needed to avoid getting killed. At any cost. \n \n***\n \nIn the first loop, with her engagement broken and her reputation in tatters, Rishe roamed with nothing but the clothes on jewelry. Finding them a good-natured band, she hitched a ride to a neighboring country.\nFrom the merchant caravan, she learned a trade, studying how to procure stock and balance ledgers. Eventually, she set out on her own to travel the world. Her upbringing as a daughter of the nobility meant that, even at fifteen years old, Rishe possessed a keen sense for beauty.\nShe collected things that caught her eye and sold them to whoever found delight in her wares. Before she realized it, she had become a major vendor, employing a full staff. She had even done business with the king of a desert nation and the prince of a frozen country up north. She traveled to many distant places, realizing a dream born from her cossetted former life spent doing nothing but preparing to be queen.\nFive years passed, and just as she had only one country left to visit, Rishe fell victim to the war sweeping across the continent.\nThe next thing she knew, she was fifteen years old again and back at that party, with the prince poised to make his pronouncement.\n\u201cRishe Irmgard Weitzner! You are a vile woman! A truly malicious creature unworthy of the crown prince! As of this instant, our engagement is off!\u201d\nNaturally, she didn\u2019t understand what was going on at first. She looked around. Everything was the same. She stood in the same place wearing the same dress and draped in the same jewelry she\u2019d sold to the caravan.\nWas it a dream? Or was everything that had happened up until then the dream? In her confusion, all she could do was stare.\nRishe hurried out of the ballroom, the impending threat of exile hanging over her and the prince\u2019s entreaties to halt ringing in her ears.\nThis is perfect! Now I can get it right! I\u2019ll grab everything valuable from my room.\nRishe had enjoyed her life as a merchant, but she had always felt a stirring of regret about this night. If only she\u2019d brought some funds from home, she would\u2019ve had the capital to establish her business much sooner!\nSpeaking of this regret always prompted disbelief from her customers, including the king of the desert. \u201cWhat? That\u2019s what you\u2019d want to do over?!\u201d\nWhen she arrived back at home on the night of her second life, Rishe grabbed her jewelry box and as many of the books her late grandmother had left her as she could carry, then made haste to the forest to meet the caravan. But the stop at her house took time, and she missed them completely.\nIn that moment, Rishe made a stark realization. Different choices meant different mistakes. Opening one door would close another.\nAnd so the easy path to a life in commerce was closed to her.\nSure, she could try to build her business from the ground up, but personal connections were almost as essential to being a merchant as business savvy. It just wasn\u2019t realistic without a single acquaintance. \nSorting through her belongings in resignation, she came across a foreign encyclopedia of herbs among her grandmother\u2019s books. Taking it as a sign, Rishe sold her jewels elsewhere and used the funds to cross the sea and pursue the study of medicine.\nFortunately, Rishe retained all her knowledge from her previous life. She remembered that certain expensive herbs could be acquired cheaply in other regions. When word spread of a disease running rampant in a neighboring country, she recalled that too. This foreknowledge proved invaluable, as did her wide travel and exposure to many different teachers with many different points of view.\nAs such, Rishe led a successful life as an apothecary. She saved a feeble prince, synthesized a number of rare medicines with her mercantile knowledge, and thus spent her days in the simple joy of helping those in need.\nUnfortunately, all the joy in the world couldn\u2019t stand up to an epidemic. Thus ended her second life. \nOnce again, she found herself in the moment of her broken engagement, the curtain rising on the third loop. Her next four lives proceeded much the same way. As a skilled lady\u2019s maid, she helped a young noblewoman to a fortuitous marriage. Once, she even disguised herself as a man and became a knight. Every life was worth living, and she enjoyed them all. She enjoyed living, period.\nThere was just one problem.\nNo matter what I do, I die at twenty.\nShe enjoyed her lives, but she was not permitted to do so for long. With this time limit always hanging over her, she spent each loop in a state of constant activity.\nI would love to take it easy for a while. Is a little leisure time too much to ask? Obviously I don\u2019t want to die either! This time, I\u2019ll make as much money as I can in the first five years. Then, when I turn twenty, I\u2019ll live a life free of worldly cares. I\u2019ll do whatever\u2019s necessary to stay alive!\nHer mind made up, Rishe began her seventh life in a dead sprint through the palace. Regardless of her future plans, she was in a race against time. She needed to beat the messenger bearing news of her scandal.\nAs she ran, she yanked off her hair ornaments; she planned to sell them and didn\u2019t want to risk losing one. Her hair billowed out behind her, falling in loose waves.\nSuddenly, an idea occurred to her, one she hadn\u2019t had in any of her previous six lives.\nLeaving through the palace gardens would be faster. I can climb down a tree from the balcony.\nRishe had gone to war as a knight in the life just before this one. After the punishing battlefield training, climbing trees was nothing.\nSeamlessly, she changed direction. She raced for the balcony, where she ran into something at full speed.\n\u201cBwargh!\u201d Rishe let out a very unladylike grunt, staggering a few steps. She looked up to see what she\u2019d bounced off of. \u201cOh\u2026\u201d\nAn exceptionally handsome man stood in her path.\nHe had refined, patrician features and cruel, thin lips. He was slender yet powerful; even through his clothes, Rishe could tell his body was well conditioned. His jet-black hair covered his ears, creeping down to the nape of his neck. The tips of his locks bounced with his movements. They looked to be soft to the touch.\nFrom head to toe, he was a pleasure to look at\u2014but what held Rishe\u2019s attention were his eyes. They were long in shape and impossibly blue, but they possessed a blade-sharp intensity. His gaze was clear, beautiful, and cold as ice. His eyelashes cast shadows on his striking face. He was a work of art.\nCurrently, this work of art was staring her down with a look that could kill.\nHe laughed. \u201cYou barreled right into me. For a moment, I thought I\u2019d been attacked by a wild boar.\u201d\nIt was an exceedingly rude thing to say to a stranger, but as luck would have it, this man was not a stranger. At least not to Rishe.\n\u201cWhat are you even doing here?\u201d the man went on. \u201cThe party is in the\u2014\u201d\nRishe interrupted him with a wordless shout of dismay. The man drew back, reflexively reaching for his sword. He composed himself with visible difficulty. \u201cWho are you? You look like any noblewoman, but your manner is\u2026\u201d \n\u201cEmperor Arnold Hein!\u201d \nThe man\u2019s eyes widened. He didn\u2019t mistake her surging contempt. Rishe had crossed swords with this man. Recently. He was the one responsible for ending her sixth life. \nHe must be a guest at the banquet. It makes sense.\nArnold Hein was the scion of a military nation not far from Rishe\u2019s home country of Hermity, the one in which they now stood. Their kingdoms, so recently at war, had brokered an ostensible peace, and the two ruling families met from time to time. Crown Prince Dietrich\u2019s engagement party would be one such occasion. He\u2019d gathered elites from far and wide to introduce to his beloved Mary.\nThe man eyed Rishe with rising curiosity. \u201cYou know me? This is my first time in Hermity.\u201d\nUh-oh. Rishe pasted on a smile as her mind spun in circles. This man was dangerous. She had to avoid entanglements with him at all costs. Five years from now, Arnold Hein would invade Hermity. \nHe was an extraordinarily skilled swordsman and, with a powerful military at his back, was destined to conquer kingdom after kingdom. He had done as much in her second, third, fourth, and fifth lives. In her sixth, Rishe had faced him in battle herself and died by his hand.\nWe never had a chance. That war was lost before it began.\nArnold\u2019s brilliance lay not in his swordplay but in his skill as a tactician. He set countries up for conquest and knocked them down, swallowing them one by one.\nI know him, but he doesn\u2019t know me. We haven\u2019t met in this life. I need an excuse fast. \nRishe curtsied slowly. \u201cMy name is Rishe Irmgard Weitzner. We\u2019ve never been introduced,",
    "query_text": " but I\u2019ve heard of you.\u201d\nArnold donned an amused smile. \u201cYou plant your weight like a trained swordswoman. Your center of gravity is perfect.\u201d\n\u201cYou exaggerate,\u201d Rishe demurred. \u201cThat was simply a curtsy to an esteemed guest.\u201d \n\u201cI must have misheard, but I swear you called me \u2018emperor\u2019 just now.\u201d \nRishe froze.\n\u201cMy father yet lives,\u201d Arnold said. \u201cI am simply a crown prince. Why would you call me that?\u201d \n\u201cUh, um\u2026\u201d Rishe floundered for an answer.\nShe\u2019d made such a foolish mistake. Arnold\u2019s gaze cut right through her. It felt like he\u2019d see through any lie she told right down to her soul. She remembered this from the battlefield"

Rishe had cautioned him about his attitude before, but he never paid her any mind.\nI\u2019m so glad I don\u2019t have to marry him.\nShe wished she could go back and tell the shocked, scared girl from her first life not to worry about her shattered engagement. Still, she might as well say it all here and now, with the assembled knights and citizens to bear witness.\n\u201cYour Highness, you exist to love and protect your people. It\u2019s unbecoming to speak of them in this manner.\u201d\n\u201cYou\u2019re the unbecoming one!\u201d the prince snapped. \u201cBeg me for forgiveness!\u201d\n\u201cI won\u2019t. Calling off our betrothal is the best course, and I applaud Your Highness for your good sense.\u201d\nNow even the knights were trembling with suppressed mirth. \nDietrich was turning red. \u201cD-don\u2019t laugh at me!\u201d\n\u201cLady Rishe,\u201d came a sweet voice. \u201cAren\u2019t you ashamed of yourself?\u201d \nRishe fought down a groan.\nOut of the crowd stepped a charming, dainty girl. Her big eyes moist with tears, she took her place at Dietrich\u2019s side. \u201cI do not allow the people I care about to be treated so very ill!\u201d \n\u201cWhy, Lady Mary. You\u2019re here.\u201d Rishe sighed. \u201cHow nice.\u201d\nThe young Mary scowled through her tears. Hidden behind her skirts, Dietrich continued to shout his disapproval. \u201cRishe! You\u2019ve brought my beloved Mary to tears! She\u2019s told me everything. How you bullied her, ridiculed her. How you find it amusing to lock her in the classroom overnight! Such a wicked woman could never be queen!\u201d\nNone of that\u2019s true.\nRishe glanced at Mary, who averted her gaze a little awkwardly.\n\u201cMore importantly,\u201d Rishe said, \u201chave you already brought your concerns to my parents, Your Highness?\u201d\n\u201cMore importantly?! I did, if you must know! Your parents are furious. They have vowed to disown you.\u201d\n\u201cAh. Then I\u2019m too late.\u201d Her parents held their reputation above all else. Rishe had little hope of retrieving any of her money or belongings now.\n\u201cWhy are you acting so strangely?\u201d Dietrich sniffed. \u201cAh, I understand. You\u2019re in such shock from this turn of events that\u2014\u201d\n\u201cListen, Dietrich.\u201d In her exasperation, Rishe dropped his title. \u201cI accept your decree. We are no longer engaged. I shall never darken your doorstep again. So\u2026relax a little.\u201d\n\u201cHuh? What are you saying?\u201d\n\u201cSince I was a child, I believed that my only value was in our betrothal. Being engaged to the crown prince was my whole reason for living. I was wrong about that. Only I determine my value\u2014no one else. That\u2019s why I don\u2019t care about this. I\u2019m beyond it.\u201d Rishe made sure to look him directly in the eye as she spoke. \u201cYou are an unnecessary element in my life.\u201d\nDietrich staggered back. His legs seemed to go out from under him, and he crumpled. At that, the knights finally let go of their composure, laughing along with the courtiers.\n\u201cSt-stop!\u201d the prince wailed. \u201cYou are my subjects. This\u2026this shows such flagrant disrespect!\u201d\n\u201cDietrich, don\u2019t pay them any mind,\u201d Lady Mary said. \u201cLady Rishe, is this cruelty necessary?\u201d\n\u201cPerhaps this is a blessing in disguise.\u201d Rishe\u2019s attention moved to Mary, making the girl\u2019s slender shoulders jump. She had no reason to worry; Rishe didn\u2019t bite. \u201cI\u2019ve been wanting the opportunity to speak to you, Lady Mary. You\u2019re strong. I admire you very much.\u201d\n\u201cWhat are you talking about?\u201d\n\u201cYou\u2019re a lovely girl who never fails to smile despite your troubles. You don\u2019t put up walls around your heart, and you do your utmost to put others at ease. Even now, you bravely stand before me to protect the prince.\u201d\nMary\u2019s eyes were wide with confusion. Rishe picked her words carefully, attempting to diminish the girl\u2019s guilty feelings, if only a little. \u201cYou need to marry the prince for your family\u2019s sake, right?\u201d\n\u201cHow do you\u2014?\u201d\nRishe had learned this truth in one of her past lives. Mary was born to a poor family, and she had studied like mad to be accepted into the academy to hunt for a husband. She intended to make sure neither she nor her brothers ever went hungry again.\nShe went on, \u201cRemember this: you are the one in control of your life. Don\u2019t sell it to anyone else. Can you trust a man who so easily discards the woman he\u2019s been engaged to since childhood? Do you truly believe he cares for you?\u201d\nAstonishment bloomed across Mary\u2019s face. She looked over at Dietrich, who hadn\u2019t bothered to stand up. The truth was\u2026within a year, Prince Dietrich would be in prison, his title stripped from him. He would plan a mad coup d\u2019\u00e9tat against the king, attempting to provoke the citizens to war. His plan would be discovered in its early stages, rendering him a laughingstock across the kingdom.\n\u201cYou must shape your future with your own hands\u2014you mustn\u2019t entrust your desires to others.\u201d \n\u201cMy\u2026my desires?\nRishe nodded.\nMary was looking at her like she was speaking a foreign language. \u201cBut I\u2019m their elder sister.\u201d Her voice quivered. \u201cI must endure, no matter what. Otherwise, my brothers will never be happy.\u201d\n\u201cAnd you believe their happiness can only be achieved by sacrificing your own?\u201d\nMary gasped as she gaped at Rishe.\n\u201cYou don\u2019t need to throw away your own future to protect those you love,\u201d Rishe told her. \u201cNo matter what path you choose, never forget that.\u201d\n\u201cMy future?\u201d Mary\u2019s voice went ragged, like she was barely suppressing a wail of pain.\n\u201cI wish you a life where both you and your family can be happy,\u201d said Rishe.\nMary stood frozen in place, eyes gleaming like precious stones. Rishe couldn\u2019t help but admire how pretty she was. She truly did wish her happiness. But right now, she needed to take care of herself. \n\u201cWell.\u201d Rishe suddenly broke into a smile, making Dietrich flinch. \u201cI think it\u2019s time for me to be on my way.\u201d\nShe regretted losing access to her room, but she knew her parents wouldn\u2019t let her in. Turning her back on the crowd, Rishe contemplated her next move.\n\u201cWait, Lady Rishe!\u201d Mary\u2019s voice rang out.\n\u201cThat\u2019s right. You\u2019re not going anywhere, Rishe!\u201d The prince joined her. \u201cYou won\u2019t get away with treating me like trash to relieve your own injured heart.\u201d\n\u201cUgh, enough already!\u201d Rishe\u2019s patience was fraying. \u201cI don\u2019t have anything else to say to you. Goodbye!\u201d\n\u201cKnights, stop her!\u201d\nReluctantly, the knights moved to tail Rishe as she walked briskly back down the path. She sympathized with them, but she wasn\u2019t about to let them keep her here. Rounding a corner, she sensed something uncanny. She stopped, the knights quickly catching up with her.\n\u201cMy apologies, Lady Rishe. If you could please remain for just a\u2014whoa!\u201d\nRishe grabbed the hilt of the knight\u2019s sword. Yanking it from his belt, she spun around and stood at the ready. Metal rang against metal as Rishe parried a blow. She glared at her would-be attacker as he stepped out of the shadows.\nArnold Hein!\n\u201cWell, what do you know.\u201d The man smiling so sweetly while their swords locked was the very man who had ended her life. \u201cYou do have some skill.\u201d\nMetal screeched and slid, before Arnold sheathed his sword. Rishe lowered hers. Neither looked away.\n\u201cWho the hell are you?\u201d demanded one of the knights.\n\u201cStand down, good sirs,\u201d Rishe said. \u201cYour interference will only make this worse.\u201d\nThis mostly served to befuddle the knights further. Rishe absolutely couldn\u2019t allow them to come to blows with the crown prince of a friendly nation. And they couldn\u2019t beat him\u2014not even if they took him all at once. Rishe had blocked his blow, but her arm was completely numb. To think he\u2019d",
    "query_text": " be even more powerful in five years.\nHe regarded her unabashedly. \u201cRishe, was that your name? Where did you learn such swordsmanship?\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m afraid I cannot say. Besides, you were clearly going easy on me.\u201d\n\u201cHa! You could tell?\u201d\nArnold\u2019s manner was throwing her off. He seemed to be enjoying himself. He\u2019s laughing. This monstrous prince is\u2026actually laughing.\nWhen she had met him in her other life, he was cold and merciless, like a genuine monster. And yet here he stood, mellow and smiling.\nThe Emperor Arnold"

No work, no study. I shall be utterly useless.\u201d\nLet\u2019s see just how much you want me as your princess.\nAfter a long moment of silence, Arnold cracked a merry laugh. The proposal remained; all her conditions were met.\n\n(2) chapter number given is likely out of range: 0\nChapter: 7\n\nChapter 2\nChapter 2\n \n\u201cYOU KNOW, it was only after I went into commerce that I truly had a dream for the future,\u201d Rishe had once confided in a friend. \u201cUp until then, I existed only as the crown prince\u2019s fianc\u00e9e or my father\u2019s daughter. My every act was to become more worthy of that status. But now, for the first time, I actually have a goal of my own.\u201d\n\u201cOh, yeah?\u201d her friend said. He was the ruler of the desert kingdom, and his smile was awfully charming. \u201cWhat\u2019s that?\u201d\nRishe smiled back. \u201cI want to travel to every single country in the world. I want to see everything in every town, peruse their markets, and meet the eyes of every person who lives there!\u201d\nBy now, that felt like such a distant dream.\n \n***\n \nRishe awoke with a start, eyes snapping open as she sensed a disturbance in the air.\nShe unsheathed her sword halfway, primed for danger. \nInside the coach, her old enemy sat across from her, one hand outstretched. \u201cWhat do you think you\u2019re doing?\u201d she demanded.\nWhen they\u2019d boarded the coach, Rishe had warned him not to lay a single finger on her throughout the trip to his kingdom. Ordering the prince not to touch his consort was absurd, but Arnold readily agreed. He had, after all, promised to follow her every direction.\nAnd yet, here he was, already breaking his promise.\nArnold appeared unperturbed by her glare. \u201cDon\u2019t look at me like that. I was merely trying to recover what you took from me.\u201d\nConfused, Rishe looked at the sword in her hand. It had a black lacquered scabbard with a simple golden decoration. Engraved on the hilt was the Galkhein crest.\n\u201cOh!\u201d Rishe thrust the sword back at Arnold. \u201cMy apologies.\u201d\nArnold chuckled. \u201cYou caught me off guard. You were nodding off, and then you suddenly snatched up my sword. You looked quite content snuggling up with it.\u201d\nArnold propped the sword beside him. Rishe pressed a hand to her chest to quell her racing heart. The sword that gutted me in my previous life is now my bedmate. What a world. Her recent stint as a knight had left her ill at ease without a blade at hand. She just couldn\u2019t believe it was Arnold\u2019s she\u2019d reached for.\n\u201cI didn\u2019t mean to disturb you, but I doubted sleeping with a weapon would be comfortable. I\u2019m impressed you sensed my intent before I even touched you.\u201d Arnold rested one elbow against the window frame, watching her with shameless fascination. \u201cOne only develops instincts like that from combat training. And you were also a member of the court? How in the world did you find the time?\u201d\nRishe shrugged. She couldn\u2019t just say, I pretended to be a man in a previous life, that\u2019s how.\n\u201cI assume there\u2019s more to you than your devotion to the sword. You seem to like flowers.\u201d\nShe followed Arnold\u2019s gaze to where she\u2019d bundled a small bouquet in a handkerchief. This was their fifth day on the road to Galkhein. Every day, without fail, she\u2019d picked flowers whenever they stopped to water the horses. The ones from today were still fresh, but the ones she\u2019d begun drying five days ago were just about ready.\n\u201cI didn\u2019t pick these because they\u2019re pretty.\u201d Rishe brought the blooms to her face, spirits rising at their sweet scent. Spring wildflowers had a soft and gentle smell. Rishe looked out the window at the forest spreading toward Galkhein, thinking of the rare native flowers going into bloom. She wished she could pick those as well, but that would cause too much delay. She gazed on wistfully.\nAfter watching her in silence for some time, Arnold said, \u201cBy the way, I sent one of my men ahead on a fast horse to deliver your order to the company you requested. They\u2019ll be invited to Galkhein to discuss the wedding ceremony.\u201d\n\u201cThank you,\u201d Rishe said. \u201cI\u2019m glad you kept your word.\u201d\n\u201cThe Aria Trading Company,\u201d Arnold mused. \u201cI\u2019ve heard of them. They\u2019re up-and-comers, aren\u2019t they? Have you done business with them before?\u201d\n\u201cNo, but I heard from a friend that they hold a very high standard of quality.\u201d\nRishe was pleasantly surprised at how easily Arnold had acceded to her request. Typically, a royal household had their own personal dealer. Getting them to do business with someone else could be difficult.\nI want to establish a connection with Aria as soon as possible, Rishe thought. It was, of course, the company that had taken her in during her first life.\nThe company had been established just two years prior to picking her up by its owner, a man named Tully. They were still in their growth stage, but in just a few years, they would be the grandest trading company in all the world. They\u2019d proven a great boon in her life as an apothecary as well, helping to distribute her newest medicines. She\u2019d struggled to win their trust initially, but she pledged to work much harder this time around.\nThis marriage isn\u2019t going to happen\u2014I need an escape plan for when it all falls apart. I must bring to bear all my knowledge and influence as a crown princess.\nRishe didn\u2019t know Arnold\u2019s plans, but she had no intention of sitting around and waiting for him to use her as he pleased. She\u2019d spend her time as his consort wisely. Everything must serve her ultimate goal: to live longer than five years, and live well.\nHer fierce determination must have shown on her face because Arnold gave her a little bemused smile. \u201cYes?\u201d\nGod! Rishe grimaced at that flawlessly handsome countenance. Such beauty, possessed by such powerful destruction. The fact that he\u2019d been the man to kill her did nothing to lessen her fascination. In fact, it almost made it worse. The study of contrasts.\n\u201cSorry, I just\u2014\u201d\nShe was interrupted by the horses\u2019 loud whinnies.\n\u201cStop! Hey, stop the coach!\u201d\nShouts drifted back from conveyance ahead of theirs, which contained the luggage and attendants. The squadron of knights tailing the column of coaches sped off toward the front.\n\u201cWho do you think you\u2014graaargh!\u201d\nThat didn\u2019t sound good. Rishe moved to climb out, but Arnold was faster. He drew his sword.\n\u201cHey!\u201d\nArnold locked the door from the outside. \u201cStay hidden.\u201d\nWhy is he putting himself in danger? That\u2019s what knights are for! The fact that Rishe had been about to do the same thing didn\u2019t occur to her. It\u2019s probably bandits. He told me to stay hidden in here, but I\u2019m not so sure about that.\nArnold had left her locked in from the outside, hoping to keep her safe, but Rishe didn\u2019t like her odds. There were five coaches, but this one was certainly the grandest. It locked on the inside as well, but that wouldn\u2019t stop someone with enough determination. If she did as she was told, she\u2019d just be waiting patiently for a bandit to break a window and drag her out.\nKeeping one eye on the coachmen fleeing into the forest, Rishe began a methodical search for something to help her. Right\u2014her hairpin!\nThis sure brings me back. She unfastened it, twisting it into the gap in the door. Back when I was a maid, my lady would lock herself in her chambers all the time to avoid her studies. I had to break her out just like this.\nThe lock on the coach was simple, and it came open easily. Once she was free, she scanned her surroundings. She didn\u2019t see anyone who looked immediately hostile, but there was noise up ahead. Cautiously, she headed toward it.\nBefore long, she found Arnold.\nWow.\nRoughly ten men\u2014the bandits, she presumed\u2014lay crumpled on the ground. In their midst stood Arnold, in the process of tripping another man into the dirt. He scowled, blade at the man\u2019s throat. \u201cIs that it, then?\u201d\n\u201cGwugh!\u201d\nArnold kicked the",
    "query_text": " bandit in the stomach, eyes blazing with cruelty. \u201cThat\u2019s all the thrill you offer me after I went to the trouble of drawing my sword? Barely worth it. I\u2019m bored already.\u201d\nHe wasn\u2019t angry; on the contrary, he stared his enemies down with chilly disappointment, as if this had all been a letdown. Even Arnold\u2019s own knights seemed terrified of their master when he was in a mood. Arnold smoothly flicked the blood off his sword, wiping the blade on the bandit\u2019s shirt before sheathing it. The rest of the men on the ground seemed to be unconscious.\nWait, he didn\u2019t kill anyone? Why not? Is it because we haven\u2019t reached Galkhein?\nShe supposed even Arnold knew better than to go around killing the citizens of other countries. Or"

That\u2019s certainly one way to describe it.\u201d Dietrich had kicked up an almighty fuss, despite being the one who broke the engagement.\n\u201cMy father approves of you because he sees you as a bargaining chip. There will be others who aren\u2019t prepared to accept you so willingly.\u201d\n\u201cIs that so?\u201d Rishe said steadily.\n\u201cNever fear,\u201d Arnold responded. \u201cThey\u2019ll eat their words, every one of them. They will receive you as their crown princess if they value their\u2014\u201d\n\u201cNo, being a hostage is perfect.\u201d \nArnold stared at her. \u201cHm?\u201d\n\u201cAs a hostage, I\u2019ll have no official duties, will I? We can pretend I\u2019m here only under great duress, and there will be no need for my comment on governmental or diplomatic affairs.\u201d\nArnold hesitated. \u201cI suppose not.\u201d\n\u201cExcellent! Then I can live my dream of being utterly useless.\u201d Rishe trembled with delight. The thought of acting as an ambassador had really been weighing on her mind. Being a princess was nonstop work. Having been groomed for the position from an early age, Rishe knew members of the royal family barely even had time to sleep.\nBut prisoners didn\u2019t have places in government.\n\u201cThis is such a weight off my mind,\u201d Rishe admitted. \u201cThank you so much for keeping your promise, Your Highness.\u201d\n\u201cEr, of course.\u201d\n\u201cBut don\u2019t worry, I won\u2019t shirk my duties as wedding planner.\u201d Nearly ready to collapse with relief, Rishe returned to her herbs.\n \n***\n \nAfter the bandit incident, Rishe felt the knights begin to ease a bit in her presence.\nDespite their initial reluctance to accept her help, they continued to report the injured men\u2019s progress and bring any concerns directly to her. In return, they took over gathering herbs from the surrounding countryside on their rest stops.\nShe hadn\u2019t done it for gratitude, but she was nonetheless touched. Gathering medicinal herbs had been second nature ever since her life as an apothecary, and it was foolish to ever turn down loyalty.\nSeveral days after the altercation with the bandits, the coach train finally arrived in the imperial capital of Galkhein.\n\u201cOh my,\u201d Rishe murmured as they passed through the gates.\nWhite stone buildings stood in straight rows, lining clean, orderly streets. The first stories all appeared to be shops, while the second-floor windows were festooned with flowers. Everywhere she looked were smiling faces, citizens turned out to witness their prince\u2019s return over the smooth brick roads. Overlooking it all was the towering magnificence of the imperial palace.\n\u201cThe capital is the seat of power in Galkhein,\u201d Arnold explained. \u201cSeveral key trade routes converge here.\u201d\nRishe nodded, suddenly anxious to be out of the coach. More and more people were gathering to watch their progress, some carrying shopping bags in both arms or holding hands with children. Many of them waved, as if greeting someone dear to them.\nHappy citizens and clean, orderly streets meant wealth. Galkhein was well-off. Rishe couldn\u2019t help but grin at an adorable little girl watching them roll by with sparkling eyes. When she saw Rishe\u2019s smile, she blushed and leapt up in the air, laughing with delight.\nThe coach made its way through the city before passing through the castle gates. Lines of disciplined knights flanked the road, ready to greet the crown prince and his fianc\u00e9e.\nArnold stepped out of the coach, holding out his hand to Rishe. She took it reflexively as she alighted. A prince would be expected to help any lady out of carriage, never mind his own consort, yet for some reason the knights looked a bit disturbed.\nRishe shot them back of look of innocent confusion.\n\u201cOur long journey is at last at its end, Your Highness, Lady Rishe.\u201d Oliver emerged from the ranks of the knights, bowing. He shot Arnold a curious glance. \u201cHow novel to see you taking the hand of your fianc\u00e9e.\u201d\nAh! Rishe realized that she herself had willingly broken the condition that she had imposed. Arnold had offered his hand, but she was the one who accepted.\nArnold gave a little laugh of triumph. Rishe felt a rush of frustration at being tricked. \nOliver stared at them before leaning in to whisper in Arnold\u2019s ear. Arnold let out a breath of annoyance. \n\u201cIs something the matter?\u201d Rishe asked.\n\u201cI sent orders ahead to have a detached wing of the palace prepared for us, but it seems the preparations are behind schedule. I\u2019m sorry, but you\u2019ll need to stay in a guest room in the main palace for a few days.\u201d\n\u201cOh, I don\u2019t mind if the wing isn\u2019t ready,\u201d Rishe said. \u201cWe can head over there now.\u201d\n\u201cIt hasn\u2019t been used in quite a while. It\u2019ll be covered in dust.\u201d\n\u201cI said that I didn\u2019t mind if it was a mess, remember? But there\u2019s no need for you to put yourself out. By all means, stay in the main palace for as long as you need.\u201d Rishe had spent a life as a maid\u2014dust didn\u2019t scare her. \u201cBesides, I\u2019m a hostage, after all.\u201d\n\u201cYou could at least attempt to sound distressed,\u201d Arnold said with the slightest trace of petulance. \nRishe, who had a huge grin spreading over her face and her chest puffed out with pride, didn\u2019t respond.\n \n***\n \nThe detached wing turned out to be just a separate palace in the distant corner of the grounds\u2014a scant four stories tall and, as advertised, absolutely swimming in dust.\nNot so bad, though. Rishe had pictured decay and clutter, but it was mostly just bare. Bare and musty, but not rotten or falling apart.\n\u201cYou can do whatever you want with this place. I\u2019ll be occupied over the next few days, but feel free to use the guest apartments in the main palace if you get tired of choking to death,\u201d Arnold said before he left.\nAccording to Oliver, work had piled up while the prince was away, and it wasn\u2019t just a few things that could be dispensed with over a few days working around the clock.\nEmperor Arnold Hein\u2026 He\u2019s just a crown prince right now, but I still wish I knew what\u2019s going on in his head. For now, I\u2019ll just focus on what I can do. Like make this place livable.\nShe changed into her plainest dress and rolled up her sleeves. The knights who\u2019d remained to serve as her guard kept watch over her as she went from window to window, throwing them all open.\nIn a stroke of luck, the weather was good, and the detached wing was well placed to soak up the sun. The lack of any creature comforts made it look ascetic and drab, but once it was furnished, Rishe had no doubt it would be lovely.\nLeaving the top floors to air out, Rishe found the stairs to the basement. She pushed the heavy wooden doors open, and mice skittered over her feet. The knights yelped as Rishe descended into the darkness.\n\u201cL-Lady Rishe, why are you going down here?\u201d\n\u201cCleaning supplies are usually kept in the basement. See?\u201d\nThe knights followed her gaze to a duster, broom, dustpan, and pile of fresh cloths. She filled a bucket with water and went to work, rolling up a handkerchief to cover her mouth as she swept dust down from high on the walls. Then she swept up all the dust on the floor.\nIt\u2019s always satisfying to tackle a place this filthy.\nShe corralled the dust bunnies until they were piled up like snow in the center of the hall, and then she swept them out the open door. Once the floors were free of debris, she attacked them with the cloth.\n\u201cLady Rishe, is there anything we can do to help?\nRishe was grateful for the knight\u2019s offer, but she shook her head. \u201cYour job is to guard me, not do my housekeeping.\u201d\n\u201cThis is quite the place to clean on your own, detached though it may be,\u201d the knight said hesitantly. \u201cIt\u2019s not too late to move into the guest chambers instead.\u201d\n\u201cThat\u2019s all right. I like the place already.\u201d\nRishe remained steadfast in her refusal for one reason: readying guest chambers was an awful chore. The palace maids would be expected to work overnight to prepare them, even if the guests were only staying a single night. No speck of dust or strand of hair could remain. Certainly no wrinkled sheets. Rishe knew how exhausting and rigorous a maid\u2019s job was, how nerve-racking.\nShe refused to put the poor dears through such an ordeal for just a few days\u2019 stay. From the sound of things, the palace wasn\u2019t equipped with many housemaids. No doubt they already had their hands full.\n\u201cBesides, take a look.\u201d She held out her arms wide, gesturing to her sparkling clean floor. The knights stared at the bright room in admiration. \u201cCleaning a place with your own hands makes living there that much more satisfying, you see.\u201d\nThe knights smiled their awkward but good-natured agreement.\nRishe worked tirelessly, and before long, the chambers where she would spend the night were ready. The knights offered to carry in the bed, which she allowed.\nWhile they brought in furniture, Rishe started cleaning another room. She had run out of clean water, so she quietly slipped out to the well without informing the knights. It wasn\u2019t quite fair to them, but these were the palace grounds. Surely she didn\u2019t need to be chaperoned everywhere.\nBesides, they\u2019re guards in name only. They\u2019re clearly just here to report my movements to Arnold Hein, Rishe reflected as she walked through a courtyard full of flowers, bucket in hand. Iridescent butterflies cavorted playfully around her feet. He doesn\u2019t seem in a hurry to introduce me to the king. Although if I\u2019m just a hostage, that doesn\u2019t surprise me.\nShe hoped she got to meet the current emperor at least once. The future Arnold\u2019s violent conquest only began after he killed the man and made himself emperor, after all.\nI wonder what happened to Arnold Hein after I died in my past life. Did he reign supreme after winning his war? Or did some country manage to put a stop to his conquest? Whatever the case, I absolutely cannot allow him to start a conflict this time. Being the empress of a wartime nation sounds like so much work! The very thought is unacceptable!\nPerhaps they could divorce, but Rishe had a feeling that if Arnold decided to discard her in the middle of a war, she would fail in her mission to make it past the age of twenty. Better to avoid the situation all together.\nWait. When she thought about it, the cause of every single one of Rishe\u2019s deaths was Arnold and his war. I died fighting. I died when Galkhein\u2019s army invaded\u2026\nLooking at her six lives, all of them had ended in more or less the same way.\nRishe found herself crouched on the ground, cradling her head in her hands. Maybe we should get a divorce right now. But it wasn\u2019t in Rishe\u2019s nature to take back her decisions once she\u2019d made them. \nIf I leave, I\u2019ll probably just die in some war-related disaster again. If I can\u2019t live apart from",
    "query_text": " him, I should take this opportunity to learn everything that I can. \nRishe didn\u2019t know the cause of her repeating lives, but there was no guarantee that the loops were infinite. She had to operate under the possibility that this life could be her last. This required some thought, but standing around seething with anxiety wouldn\u2019t help.\nRight now I\u2019ll focus on cleaning. Once the bath is here, I\u2019ll scrub off all the dust and travel exhaustion. And then I can finally relax! \nBrimming with new determination, she stood up and headed for the well. She was forestalled by the sound of jeering giggles. \n\u201cAww, look at the new girl"

    "prefix_text": " surprise. Arnold had every right to demand she act the part of a proper consort. This was a political marriage; Rishe was essentially a hostage, after all. Yet here he was, cosigning her misbehavior. Moreover, he was all but swearing to defend her from the consequences.\n\u201cWhy?\u201d\n\u201cYou know why. I\u2019m enamored with you.\u201d Arnold fed her the same line. \u201cI know you said you don\u2019t care about other people\u2019s approval, but I like your asymmetrical talents. I don\u2019t find them useless at all.\u201d \nRishe didn\u2019t know how to respond.\n\u201cI thought I\u2019d already made that clear.\u201d He took his hand back, drawing away, stopping just on the threshold. He turned back to a stunned Rishe and said, \u201cLet me know if there\u2019s anything you desire. I realize I just broke our agreement\u2014the one about not touching you.\u201d\nAnd with that, he was gone.\nShaken, Rishe sank to the floor of the balcony. I can\u2019t predict him at all! Just what is Arnold Hein planning?\nThe quiet of evening fell over the imperial capital of Galkhein.\n \n***\n \n\u201cMmm.\u201d\nSunshine streamed through the window as Rishe roused from sleep. She rolled over, basking in the morning light. The wall she expected wasn\u2019t there, and the bed seemed larger than usual. Taking advantage of it, she stretched out as far as she could.\nWas this her chamber at home? Or maybe she was a merchant again, spending a night at the desert king\u2019s palace. Perhaps this was her bed of straw from her life as a maid? Her memories met and interwove as she drifted into wakefulness.\nWhen Rishe finally opened her eyes, she grew even more confused.\nLight blue curtains surrounded the bed, thin enough to allow sunlight to pass through. She pulled them aside to find herself in a bare room devoid of furniture and carpet.\nOh, right. She didn\u2019t need to report for morning training, tend to her herb garden, prepare breakfast, or see how the bottles she had brewed overnight were coming along.\nRealizing that, Rishe buried her face in the pillow. \u201cSo soft,\u201d she murmured. \nJudging by the position of the sun, it was about six o\u2019clock in the morning. She was pretty sure she had gone to bed around midnight last night.\nI slept for six whole hours? Rishe couldn\u2019t believe it. Generally, she was used to getting about four hours of sleep. On bad days, at the height of an emergency as a knight or apothecary, she wouldn\u2019t even get that much. \nI\u2019ve got nothing but cleaning on the schedule today. Hostages can sleep in, right? At least a little? Excitement suffused her at the thought, but that was interrupted by a knock on the door.\n\u201cLady Rishe, are you awake? It\u2019s Oliver\u2014Prince Arnold\u2019s attendant.\u201d\nRishe sat up with a start. \u201cI\u2019m awake!\u201d\nOliver continued to speak through the door. \u201cI apologize for bothering you at such an early hour. I\u2019m here with a delivery.\u201d\n\u201cJust a moment!\u201d Rishe slipped out of the bed, dressed quickly, and tugged the bed\u2019s canopy closed. She opened the door to find Oliver standing in the hallway with a polite smile.\nHe apologized again. \u201cThis was the only time I could slip away from His Highness\u2019s office. I\u2019m glad to see that you\u2019re already dressed.\u201d\n\u201cNot at all.\u201d Rishe paused, stepping back to allow him inside. \u201cOh my. You look exhausted.\u201d\nOliver grimaced. \u201cIs it that obvious? We\u2019ve been climbing through mountains of paperwork, but never mind me. His Highness has been working around the clock.\u201d\nRishe thought back to yesterday, how he had come all the way out to the balcony. He should have used that spare time to sleep. \u201cHe\u2019s in high demand, isn\u2019t he? He was even working on the trip over.\u201d\n\u201cHe finished all the work he brought along with us,\u201d Oliver confirmed. \u201cNow he\u2019s dealing with everything that piled up during his visit to Hermity.\u201d\n\u201cOh.\u201d Rishe grimaced in sympathy. He may have killed her in a past life, but she wouldn\u2019t wish the bureaucracy of kingship on anyone. \u201cIt\u2019s a shame he had to put his work on hold to attend a silly engagement party.\u201d\n\u201cNo matter. That party was how a committed bachelor finally found a bride.\u201d\nHis smile was sincere, but Rishe knew better. She spread her arms. \u201cGo on. Shall I spin around so you have a better view?\u201d\nOliver blinked. \u201cI beg your pardon?\u201d\n\u201cYou\u2019re looking me over like I\u2019m a horse for sale. If there\u2019s anything I can help you with, please let me know.\u201d\nOliver\u2019s brows went up. He let out a little breath of resignation. \u201cHis Highness was right. You do possess the keen perception of a knight. Of course, I\u2019m purely an amateur myself.\u201d\nI\u2019d say this was a merchant\u2019s sixth sense, rather than battle intuition.\nThis wasn\u2019t the first time Rishe had caught Oliver looking at her. It reminded her of the way her noble customers would examine a product, assessing worth and authenticity. Or a merchant weeding out potential merchandise from a wide array of choices.\nIn other words, he was appraising her.\nOliver moved into a deep, sweeping bow. \u201cMy sincerest apologies, my lady. I have been unaccountably rude to my lord\u2019s consort. My behavior was unacceptable.\u201d\nRishe shook her head. \u201cPlease don\u2019t, it\u2019s fine.\u201d It wasn\u2019t unreasonable for the prince\u2019s closest attendant to be wary of strangers. But it did make her curious. \u201cHow long have you worked for Arnold? Have you always been a valet?\u201d\n\u201cI trained as a squire, actually,\u201d Oliver replied. \u201cBut I was injured and dismissed from the order. His Highness took me into his household soon after. I have served him for nearly a decade.\u201d\n\u201cThen maybe you can answer this,\u201d Rishe said. \u201cWhy is Prince Arnold so very intent on making me his wife?\u201d\nOliver hesitated, as if weighing the pros and cons of speaking, \u201cTo be quite honest, I was as surprised as you were. He\u2019s always insisted he had no interest in marriage. But the sight of you in Hermity has changed his mind. Apparently.\u201d\nSo not even his attendant understood his motives. Rishe remained at a complete loss.\n\u201cIf I may, however?\u201d Oliver mistook Rishe\u2019s confusion for anxiety and added, \u201cI have served Prince Arnold for a long time, and never before have I seen him so happy. When he is with you, he laughs. His smiles are sincere.\u201d\nRishe was taken aback. She\u2019d figured all of Arnold\u2019s laughter and teasing was at her expense. His own private jokes.\n\u201cAre you\u2026unhappy with him?\u201d Oliver ventured. \u201cWith his looks, His Highness is exceedingly popular with the ladies of the court, you know.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m sure he has many admirers.\u201d She paused. \u201cWould you really call the way he acts around me \u2018happy\u2019? To me, it seems more like a cat with a mouse.\u201d\nOliver laughed. He didn\u2019t deny it. \u201cI am pleased you understand His Highness so well. Oh, I nearly forgot. Here.\u201d\nHe held out a sheaf of three documents. \u201cThis is the guest list for your wedding. His Highness bids you look over it.\u201d\n\u201cThank you,\u201d Rishe said, pleasantly surprised. She hadn\u2019t even needed to ask. She gave it a quick glance, quickly identifying the most prominent and powerful names.\nKing Zahad, Prince Kyle, Princess Harriet. And from the Kingdom of Domana, we have Lord Jonal attending as the representative of the king. No surprise there.\nMore than a wedding guest register, this was a list of key people from the countries Arnold would go on to antagonize. Even before the murder of the king and the start of the war, there must have been a trigger\u2014a sea change in the affairs of state. Everyone on this list was most likely involved.\nKing Zahad. I hope we can be friends again like in my first life. Hmm\u2026 Prince Kyle is rather frail. I hope he isn\u2019t working himself too hard. He has a strong sense of responsibility\u2014he\u2019ll attend the wedding even though it\u2019ll be a long trip.\nThe sight of these names filled Rishe with a longing for those lives, for the people she\u2019d once known. And sometime in the very near future, they would all be Galkhein\u2019s enemies.\nIf I take matters into my own hands, perhaps I can salvage some of these relationships before they sour. Even if we aren\u2019t allies, we don\u2019t have to be enemies. Anything to stave off the outbreak of war.\nOliver had no idea what was going through Rishe\u2019s head. Brightly, he continued their conversation. \u201cThe ceremony will be held in three months\u2019 time. All preparations must be complete by then. And now\u2026we need to discuss tonight\u2019s party.\u201d\n\u201cTonight\u2019s what?\u201d\nOliver stiffened. \u201cDid His Highness not tell you?\u201d\n\u201cNo, he most certainly did not! There\u2019s to be a party?\u201d\n\u201cUgh, not again!\u201d Oliver dug his knuckles into his forehead.\nRishe put two and two together. She hesitated, then said, \u201cSo there is one, then. As you must know, His Highness is trying to stamp it down without telling me.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d Oliver replied. \u201cHe should have mentioned it to you. You don\u2019t need to attend, but he will. At least, I hope he will. I think I managed to convince him.\u201d\nShe sympathized with Oliver. Under normal circumstances, it would be unheard of for the crown prince and his fianc\u00e9e to fail to appear at a banquet. \u201cDon\u2019t worry, Oliver. I\u2019ll go.\u201d\nOliver let out a sigh of relief. \u201cReally? Thank you so much, my lady. I\u2019ll put finding you a maid at the top of my to-do list.\u201d\n\u201cNo need.\u201d Rishe smiled. \u201cI can prepare for the party on my own.\u201d\nThis maid-selection process made Rishe uneasy. After witnessing that exchange between the servants in the garden, she imagined quarrels breaking out all through the palace. And she doubted the disputes would go away even after they decided.\nOliver frowned. \u201cBut won\u2019t dressing be difficult without a lady\u2019s maid?\u201d \nShe shook her head. \u201cI can do my hair and put on a gown by myself. I brought dresses and cosmetics from home. Don\u2019t worry.\u201d\nRishe ignored Oliver\u2019s stunned look, already reevaluating her cleaning plans.\n \n***\n \nThe first thing Rishe said to Arnold that night was, \u201cYour Highness, I have a request.\u201d Her gown rustled as she leaned in close. \u201cI would like some herb seed and a corner of the gardens. I made a list. I hope we can discuss this in more detail later.\u201d\nArnold was silent a moment. \u201cRishe.\u201d\n\u201cWhat? Didn\u2019t you tell me to let you know if there was anything I wanted?\u201d She looked at him quizzically, and Arnold sighed.\nShe\u2019d heard that he\u2019d finished his mountain of work and even managed to sleep for a while. He was dressed in his usual military black, trimmed with a red mantle and black gloves.\nArnold shook his head. \u201cThat\u2019s not what I mean. I\u2019m guessing that Oliver didn\u2019t tell you the reason for this party? It\u2019s merely for appearance\u2019s sake. I need to look like I\u2019m searching for a bride within our borders as well. There\u2019s no reason for you to attend.\u201d\nIt made sense. The crown prince\u2014the greatest catch in the kingdom\u2014marrying a foreigner without even the slightest nod to propriety would invite unwanted discontent from the nobility.\n\u201cHowever, we\u2019re betrothed,\u201d Arnold said. \u201cThis whole evening is merely a formality. And with news that you\u2019re my \u2018hostage\u2019 going around, you\u2019ll be an object of curiosity. I don\u2019t want to put you through that.\u201d\n\u201cWell, I already went to the trouble of getting ready.\u201d Rishe plucked at her soft blue dress, draped in fluttering layers around her like a flower bud. She\u2019d braided her hair, decorating it with accessories. Her makeup was light, her shoes polished to a mirror shine. Her only jewelry was a pair of pearl earrings.\n\u201cRishe\u2026\u201d\n\u201cYour Highness, the court may consider my status as a captive princess shameful in the extreme, but I don\u2019t.\u201d She\u2019d chosen this course, after all.\nArnold was again watching her with a mixture of wonder and confusion.\n\u201cSo don\u2019t worry,\u201d she said, extending her hand. \u201cFeel free to show off your fianc\u00e9e.\u201d\nArnold relented, his dashing smile",
    "query_text": " creeping out once again. \u201cVery well. I should take advantage of this opportunity to touch my betrothed.\u201d\n\u201cWe\u2019re wearing gloves.\u201d\nArnold took Rishe\u2019s hand.\nA throng of guests was gathered in the ballroom as a group of musicians performed on a platform. Women in gowns stood clustered, while gentlemen in military attire grouped together. A mere glance was enough to tell their clothes were of the highest quality. They mingled happily, making small talk with glasses in hand.\nRishe let her hand rest on Arnold\u2019s arm as she paused at the threshold to take it all in. \u201cThis is a bigger event than I was expecting.\u201d\n\u201cIs it? I\u2019d say it\u2019s a rather small gathering, actually.\u201d\n\u201cMaybe for"

I felt like I was watching a sword duel!\u201d\n\u201cIs this a dance from Hermity? I\u2019ve never seen such steps before.\u201d\n\u201cUh, well\u2026\u201d Rishe floundered. She glanced up at Arnold, who appeared to be enjoying her struggle. She\u2019d get no help from him.\nRishe dealt with the barrage of questions as best she could, letting the crowd sweep them into the dining room, which was set up for a buffet-style meal. She made sure to greet every guest, riveting their faces into her memory.\nShe must have been acting peculiar, because Arnold eventually said, \u201cRishe, I think the wine is getting to you. Shall we get some fresh air?\u201d\nRishe hadn\u2019t touched a single drop. In fact, she\u2019d been caught up in so many conversations that she hadn\u2019t even had the chance to eat, but she had experience working on an empty stomach. She accepted Arnold\u2019s encouragement as the escape it was.\nJust when I least expect it, he\u2019ll act the gentleman. Maybe he\u2019d remembered her demand for a carefree life of doing nothing.\nRishe cast a charming look across the crowd. \u201cThank you for your consideration, Your Highness. Forgive me.\u201d She gave a polite bow before quietly slipping away. \nShe didn\u2019t head straight to the balcony but rather slowly walked around the hall. There was only so much she could find out glued to Arnold\u2019s side all night.\nI need information. Galkhein\u2019s political landscape was a mystery to me through all my past lives. I only know the rumors that made it abroad.\nAlthough she knew of Arnold\u2019s eventual patricide, she had no concept of the circumstances leading up to it. She needed a better picture of the factions and power balance inside the court. The lives these people led.\nI know better than to believe wartime gossip. This Arnold Hein is a lot different from what I\u2019d heard he was like at nineteen. He\u2019s not as diabolical as the rumors led me to believe. He likes to push, but he isn\u2019t unkind. The thought drifted across her mind, leaving her conflicted. Well, he\u2019s not unkind now. But I still don\u2019t like not knowing his motives. And he\u2019s a bit of a jerk, to be honest. \nShe tried to settle her mind and just observe. Gathering intelligence was necessary to lead a long, carefree life lazing around the palace.\nIf I recall correctly, that\u2019s Lord Hannawald. He seems to be on good terms with Count Gayle. Duke Hudemann and Duke Teinitz are having a friendly enough conversation, yet they don\u2019t seem close. Rishe ticked off the names of people she\u2019d met, committing them to memory.\nA wave of sweet perfume wafted over her. A pretty girl with soft blonde hair had appeared at her side. \u201cHow do you do, Lady Rishe? I\u2019m Cornelia Thea Toona.\u201d\nDuke Toona\u2019s family was the thirty-first house she\u2019d met tonight.\nRishe smiled graciously. \u201cRishe Irmgard Weitzner. A pleasure to meet you.\u201d\n\u201cThe pleasure is all mine.\u201d Cornelia smiled sweetly. Her eyes were big and bright, her lips full. She held a glass in each hand and offered one to Rishe. \u201cWine? I see you\u2019re empty-handed.\u201d\nA gaggle of other ladies nearby began giggling among themselves.\n\u201cHow dare she act so haughty when she\u2019s a captive. It\u2019s time for her learn just what she is. A pawn to be played and discarded.\u201d\n\u201cShe should enjoy her time on Prince Arnold\u2019s arm while she can.\u201d\n\u201cShe is from a minor nation, after all.\u201d\nAs Rishe took note of their whispers, Cornelia gazed at her with doe eyes. \u201cDoes my offering offend you in some way?\u201d\nIf I remember correctly, House Toona holds a vast territory in southern Galkhein.\nRishe held out a hand to accept the glass. \u201cHow could it? Thank you, Lady Cornelia.\u201d\nBefore Rishe could touch the glass, Cornelia gave a dramatic shout. \u201cOh dear! My hand slipped!\u201d She dropped it, quite obviously on purpose. Without thinking, Rishe grabbed her skirts and leaned back, plucking the glass out of the air with the other hand.\nCornelia let out a cry of surprise as Rishe caught the wine before any could spill. She swirled the glass and brought it to her nose to breathe in the bouquet.\nHmm\u2026 That\u2019s mashed capsicum. Where did she even get that? What a waste of perfectly good wine. And why bother spicing it enough to singe the tongue if she just planned to ruin my dress? Pick a plan, my dear.\nHiding her exasperation, Rishe smiled brightly. \u201cI\u2019ve never had a wine quite like this. What an unusual scent.\u201d\nCornelia bit her lip in frustration. Rishe beamed at her. You\u2019ve got such a pretty face, Lady Toona. Why don\u2019t you smile?\nRishe leaned in close to Cornelia. \u201cThis vintage isn\u2019t available where I\u2019m from. I\u2019m ever so anxious to learn more. Should I perhaps invite Prince Arnold over to enjoy a glass? Which tray did you get this from?\u201d\n\u201cWhat? Oh, um\u2026\u201d Rishe had a policy of never backing down from a fight, but it seemed Cornelia didn\u2019t share it. \u201cS-sorry, but I don\u2019t remember. Such a large hall, you see.\u201d\n\u201cA shame. I\u2019ll just give His Highness this one, then. I\u2019ll be sure to let him know who it\u2019s from.\u201d\n\u201cUh, wait!\u201d Cornelia rapidly shook her head. \u201cI-I got that glass for you, so I think you should\u2014you know what? Never mind! Maybe I should just take that\u2014oh no!\u201d\nRishe ignored the ashen-faced Cornelia, raising the glass and swallowing down a gulp. \n\u201cI-I can\u2019t believe\u2026\u201d\n\u201cSuch a spicy flavor, just as I imagined.\u201d Rishe smiled again to the assembled group\u2019s astonishment. \u201cWhat a warm welcome. I do hope the two of us can spend more time together. Perhaps\u2026a tea party?\u201d\n\u201cTh-the two of us?\u201d Cornelia stammered.\n\u201cYes. I want to know all about House Toona.\u201d\nCornelia looked flabbergasted, but she recovered herself and nodded.\nThat should do. One of Rishe\u2019s eventual plans required a plot of land in a temperate climate. House Toona\u2019s would likely be perfect, but she needed to confirm a few things with Cornelia. Never back down from a fight. Even further\u2026\nShe recalled the words of her mentor from her days as a merchant.\nDon\u2019t bother with fights you can\u2019t win.\nThe other ladies fled, fearful of this strange girl who gulped down painfully spicy wine like it was nothing. \n \n***\n \nRishe retreated to the empty balcony to enjoy the music, grimacing with every stinging mouthful of wine. She drank it in decreasing sips until Arnold joined her.\n\u201cWhat are you making that face for?\u201d\nRishe swirled the glass. \u201cDon\u2019t worry, it\u2019s not you. It\u2019s just this wine is so spicy.\u201d\n\u201cSpicy? The wine is?\u201d\n\u201cMm. It\u2019s seasoned with capsicum. I barely managed to get that first mouthful down without gagging.\u201d\nArnold swiped the glass from her hand. \u201cDon\u2019t tell me this was a poisoning attempt!\u201d\nRishe clicked her tongue in annoyance at her own lack of vigilance. No one else would be able to grab something from her so easily.\nArnold glared at the wine. \u201cYou don\u2019t need to drink this. I\u2019ll get rid of it.\u201d\n\u201cHey, give that back! They ruined a perfectly good glass of wine because of me. I\u2019m not going to waste it.\u201d She grabbed it back and took another sip, shuddering at the taste.\nArnold glowered. \u201cTell me who did this. I\u2019ll have them executed.\u201d\n\u201cDon\u2019t be ridiculous. You don\u2019t kill people like her\u2014you use them.\u201d Just the tiniest bit of wine to go, but it was getting harder to make herself drink it. She gave the glass a reproachful look, then glanced back at Arnold. \u201cOh, and I owe you an apology.\u201d\n\u201cDo you?\u201d\n\u201cI used your name to defend myself.\u201d The girls had only backed off when she threatened to tattle to Arnold. Rishe found that sort of thing inelegant in the extreme, and she was embarrassed.\nArnold sighed at Rishe\u2019s apologetic bow. \u201cThere\u2019s nothing wrong with a wife invoking her husband\u2019s name.\u201d\nRishe hesitated. \u201cWe\u2019re not married yet.\u201d\n\u201cThat\u2019s a formality. It\u2019s as good as done, if you ask me.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2026see.\u201d\nHe took her distraction as an opportunity to swipe her glass back. Instead of dumping it out, Arnold gulped the rest of it down. \n\u201cDamn, that packs a punch,\u201d he grumbled.\n\u201cI told you that!\u201d Rishe snapped. \u201cAre you all right? Let me get you some water!\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m fine. But now you\u2019ve fulfilled your obligation to the wine, haven\u2019t you?\u201d\nRishe didn\u2019t know what to say. He\u2019d helped her\u2014not by taking charge but by following her lead. Without cutting her down and telling her she was being foolish. Without rolling his eyes and dismissing her desires as trifles.\n\u201cThank you,\u201d Rishe said stiffly, which just made him laugh.\n\u201cWhat were you thinking about when we were dancing?\u201d he asked.\n\u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d\n\u201cYou were thinking about someone else, weren\u2019t you? Who?\u201d\nRishe didn\u2019t know a delicate way to say I was thinking about a future version of you I met in another life.\n\u201cHmm?\u201d His tone was oddly light, teasing even. But the gleam in his hunter\u2019s eyes said she wouldn\u2019t get away so easily.\nObviously, Rishe couldn\u2019t give him an honest answer. \u201cI wasn\u2019t thinking about anyone else. I was worried about you.\u201d\n\u201cWhy?\u201d\nThis was the closest she could come to the truth. \u201cWere you injured here?\u201d She patted her own left shoulder with her forefinger. \nArnold went silent. His left shoulder was slightly slower to react than his right\u2014if his right was at one hundred, then his left was at maybe ninety-eight. It was hardly noticeable, but Rishe had picked up on it. He was right-handed, and she wouldn\u2019t have noticed it if they\u2019d been dancing normally. \nThat, and if it hadn\u2019t been for memories from her past life.\nRishe had only managed to inflict a single injury on him. An instant, a moment\u2019s hesitation where she saw her chance and slashed left. Of course, he\u2019d shrugged off the injury and effortlessly run her through. \n\u201cHeh.\u201d Arnold finally broke his silence with grim laughter. His eyes sent shivers down her spine, cold and bewitching. In lieu of an answer, he reached for his collar, unfastening the clasp with a snap and drawing his jacket open with a rough tug.\nOh my.\nRishe drew in a breath. A great scar was engraved into the nape of his neck, just low enough to be concealed by clothing. It looked several years old. \u201cIt\u2019s an old wound. It continues to the top of my shoulder and pulls the skin taut.\u201d\n\u201cHow awful.\u201d Rishe couldn\u2019t help but reach out to gingerly touch the nape of his neck.\nArnold accepted her touch without a word. She\u2019d half expected to be slapped aside.\nHer fingers slowly traced the shape of it. She could feel the rough skin through her gloves.\nHe must have gotten this over a decade ago. Someone stabbed him\u2014and not just once or twice. They must have done it over and over to make this scar pattern.\nHer medical training had her shuddering at the image of a nine-year-old Arnold ashen and trembling with blood loss. The fact that he\u2019d survived and retained the use of his arm was incredible. And then to go on to wield a sword so skillfully\u2014his suffering must have been immense.\n\u201cOnly a few people know about this injury. You\u2019re the first to notice on your own.\u201d\n\u201cHow did it happen?\u201d\nThat grim smile returned as he looked down at Rishe. With the moon hanging behind him, he was as opaque as ever, but Rishe understood the sentiment.\nI shouldn\u2019t pry.\nRishe pulled her hand away, and that ominous smile that sent chills down her spine disappeared. Arnold put his jacket back in order, reclasping it at the neck.\nSomeone tried to kill Arnold Hein about ten years ago. But who and why? Rishe cast her eyes down as she ruminated. The most obvious beneficiaries of a dead crown prince would be potential heirs and those loyal to them. I believe Arnold has a younger brother, but I haven\u2019t met him yet.\nOdd. Rishe might be a hostage, but shouldn\u2019t she meet her future relatives? Perhaps it was Arnold\u2019s doing and not the will of the imperial family themselves. He didn\u2019t seem to want to involve her in anything unless it was absolutely necessary\u2014he hadn\u2019t told her about this ball, after all. \nRishe looked up at him. \u201cYour Highness, may I select my maids some time over the next few days?\u201d \n\u201cVery well. I\u2019ll tell Oliver to make that a priority.\u201d\n\u201cAh, I can do the selection myself. We needn\u2019t trouble him.\u201d\nArnold arched an amused brow. Gone was that unsettling smile, replaced with his easy manner. \u201cWhat are you planning this time?\u201d\n\u201cOh, nothing important,\u201d Rishe said. She picked up her empty glass. \u201cI\u2019m merely concerned about the servants\u2019 working conditions.\u201d\nTo protect her life and well-being, she needed to keep from dying at twenty years old again. And to do that, she had to prevent Arnold Hein\u2019s war. Her best bet would be to appeal to the important people she\u2019d known in her past lives. People with influence.\nPlus, there was a mountain of things she needed to do in preparation for the marriage ceremony.\nI need to sow a plot of land, grow herbs, do lots of shopping, get cheap alcohol, and then\u2026 \nRishe began a to-do list that had nothing to do with war in the least.\n \n***\n \nAs the ball wound to a close, a lone boy stood in the gloomy courtyard of the imperial palace. He had soft black hair and round blue eyes. No older than sixteen, he had an androgynous grace to him, gaze fixed on the balcony above. \nHe was watching a girl.\nShe had coral-colored hair, and even from this distance, he could tell she was beautiful. She stood there alone, apparently waiting for someone. Whoever it was must have shown up because her hand slipped from the banister, and she stepped away. Not too long after, a man appeared where she had been standing.\nThe man turned a silent glare down into the garden, as if he\u2019d known the boy had been there the whole time, despite the shadows.\nA shiver ran down the boy\u2019s spine and he smiled reflexively, delighting in the intense aura of threat the man gave off. It was just a warning, it seemed, as the man abruptly turned on his heel and disappeared. \n\u201cAww, we can\u2019t play together either?\u201d The boy hung his head. \u201cI miss you, Brother.\u201d\nIt had to be the woman. The beauty. She\u2019d made the boy\u2019s life hell since the day she arrived. \nHis brother had prohibited him from attending balls like this one. That was fine; he\u2019d sooner avoid them altogether. Still, he\u2019d wanted to meet that girl. \n\u201cBut we\u2019ll meet soon enough, won\u2019t we?\u201d He spoke to himself in a soft voice. \u201cI\u2019ve got plans for you, Sister.\u201d \n\n(2) chapter number given is likely out of range: 0\nChapter: 8\n\nChapter 3\nChapter 3\n \n\u201cYOU\u2019RE ALL SO USELESS!\u201d Diana the redheaded maid\u2019s voice rang out inside the stone washhouse. \nThree days had passed since the afternoon Rishe shook off her guard and came out to the well. Rishe was once again dressed to fit in with the maids. At Diana\u2019s shout, she looked up without pausing in her work. \n\u201cIs even laundry beyond your capabilities? I asked you to wash these this morning, and now it\u2019s past noon! Meanwhile, we\u2019ve finished cleaning the entire first floor in a third of the time!\u201d\n\u201cI-I\u2019m sorry, Diana.\u201d\nThe new maids went silent with shame. Among them was Elsie, the girl Rishe stood up for the other day. Rishe pulled her hands out of the soapy water, gently rinsed them, and said, \u201cLet me help. What still needs to be done?\u201d\n\u201cYou again?\u201d Diana rounded on Rishe. \u201cI don\u2019t know who you serve, but I\u2019m amazed you have the time to do other people\u2019s work. I wish I had so much free time.\u201d\nHuffily, she turned from Rishe. \u201cLet\u2019s just ignore these useless fools. Laura, Maya. Come on. If we want to be chosen as Lady Rishe\u2019s maids, we mustn\u2019t waste our time.\u201d\nDiana took out a slip of paper from her pocket, smoothing it out. \u201cIt looks like the new bedsheets for her palace will arrive today. We should inspect them to make sure everything is perfect!\u201d\n\u201cWait up, Diana!\u201d\nThe two maids followed Diana",
    "query_text": " out. Rishe waited for the door to close before turning to Elsie and the others. \u201cLet\u2019s keep working. If there\u2019s anything too large and cumbersome, feel free to pass it over to me.\u201d\n\u201cTh-thank you so much!\u201d The new maids went weak with gratitude. One of them, a girl on the verge of tears, even fell into a full bow. Rishe muttered encouragement as she scrubbed some bedsheets.\nElsie, who was washing the sheets with her, wore a rueful look. \u201cI\u2019m so sorry for the trouble. We\u2019re just not learning fast enough.\u201d\n\u201cYou"

    "prefix_text": "-thirds of these maids are newly recruited from the city. Since the majority of the castle maids were elderly, His Highness assumed you would prefer maids closer in age to yourself.\u201d\nRishe was startled. She had found it odd that most of her potential servants were new hires, but she hadn\u2019t expected this to be the reason.\n\u201cWhile the prince has entrusted the selection of your maids to you,\u201d Oliver went on. \u201cHiring someone with no experience will not do. Despite Prince Arnold\u2019s views, I urge you to reject the newcomers.\u201d\n\u201cOliver.\u201d\n\u201cI have a list of their names here. Elsie\u2014\u201d\n\u201cElsie, Nichole, Hilde, Marguerite, Rosa.\u201d Rishe began listing the names of the newly recruited maids. She\u2019d made a point to memorize them in the washhouse. \u201cElke, Amelia, and\u2014\u201d\nOliver looked at her wildly. \u201cYou know them all?! Even though they\u2019ve never served you in the past?\u201d\n\u201cYes, of course I do. Servants are essential to the maintenance of our lifestyle, why wouldn\u2019t I get to know them?\u201d Rishe listed the remaining names for good measure. \u201cAll twenty of you, listen to me.\u201d \nThe new maids stiffened. Diana and the other maids whose names hadn\u2019t been called were getting their wind back, wearing increasingly triumphant looks.\nRishe said, \u201cThe twenty names I just called will be my maids.\u201d\nTime seemed to stand still a moment, and then Oliver broke in with an astonished, \u201cB-but, my lady! They are all inexperienced\u2014\u201d\n\u201cYes. And my palace will be the perfect place to learn.\u201d\nThe new recruits were completely speechless, unsure of exactly what was happening. \nRishe smiled at Elsie. \u201cI hope you\u2019ll serve me well, Elsie.\u201d\nElsie was still frozen in place. \u201cHuh? Y-yes, my lady, but\u2014\u201d\nA shaking Diana cried out, \u201cBut why, my lady?! You\u2019ve seen their work! They\u2019re useless, the lot of them! The rest of us get so much more done in a shorter amount of time!\u201d\n\u201cWatch your tongue, girl,\u201d Oliver said sharply.\nDiana ignored him. \u201cWe\u2019re hard workers! Any job you assign us, we can do it! Please, I beg you, my lady!\u201d\n\u201cStep back,\u201d Oliver warned. \u201cDo not take a single step closer to Lady Rishe.\u201d\nDiana spoke in a rush, words pouring out of her. \u201cI-I freely admit that I was impolite before, but I didn\u2019t know who she was! I\u2019ll take any punishment, so please, give me the chance to show you how well I can work!\u201d\nRishe said, \u201cDiana, I have a request.\u201d\n\u201cTh-thank you, my lady!\u201d Diana heaved a sigh of relief. \u201cYou mean you\u2019ll\u2014\u201d \nRishe cut across her. \u201cAs of today, you are no longer a maid in this palace.\u201d \n\u201cWhat?\u201d Her face, usually so fixed with determination, paled. \u201cBut why? I\u2019m so much better than any of them! I\u2019ll do a perfect job no matter what task you set before me. Please don\u2019t dismiss me, my lady!\u201d \n\u201cListen to me, Diana.\u201d Rishe dropped her lofty tone, speaking as one woman would to another. \u201cYou have noticed it, haven\u2019t you? No matter what you claim, these new girls aren\u2019t worthless.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2026I don\u2019t understand.\u201d\n\u201cCan you remember your first month in service? How difficult it was?\u201d\nDiana looked completely bewildered. Her gaze darted around as if looking for help.\nPulling herself together, she forced herself to follow Rishe\u2019s directions. She thought back and finally alighted on a response. \u201cI\u2026I didn\u2019t know how to do the job. Before, when my family was still prominent, I\u2019d washed shirts and bedsheets. Never gowns or military uniforms.\u201d\n\u201cPerfectly reasonable,\u201d Rishe said. \u201cOnly natural for someone just starting out.\u201d\n\u201cThe older girls were so busy, they told me to just watch them since they didn\u2019t have time to teach me. When I had questions\u2026well, there was nobody to ask.\u201d\n\u201cI bet. And did you have any other problems?\u201d\n\u201cWell, yes. There was a lot to learn. Different kinds of soap and washboards depending on the cloth. You use different tools for different materials. I had to learn how they worked and how to put them away. I was\u2026punished if I didn\u2019t get it right the first time.\u201d\nThe newcomers were exchanging surprised looks. Rishe understood why.\nEverything Diana said was familiar to them. They spent valuable time searching for their materials and the proper ways to use them, but they shrank from asking for help. Everyone always looked so busy. This was a universal problem.\n\u201cDespite all that, I got better!\u201d Diana protested. \u201cI only needed to be taught once. Unlike them! They\u2019re useless!\u201d\n\u201cYes, well. There\u2019s a difference between you and them,\u201d Rishe told Diana. \u201cYou can read and write.\u201d\n\u201cOh!\u201d Diana started in surprise. Elsie looked at the floor.\nThe literacy rate among commoners was low no matter where you went. Very few families had the means to afford an education, especially for daughters. Diana had been born to a merchant\u2019s family\u2014she\u2019d received formal schooling. The maids she was close friends with were likely from similar backgrounds. The majority of those in service were not so fortunate.\n\u201cWhat if you only received instructions on how to do a job once and weren\u2019t able to write it down to remind yourself later?\u201d Rishe asked. \u201cWould you be so confident?\u201d\n\u201cI-I don\u2019t\u2014\u201d Diana reflexively thrust a hand into her apron pocket, where she had a list of daily tasks recorded in her neat handwriting to reference throughout the day. Hopefully now she would understand how much of an edge her privileged literacy gave her over the other maids.\n\u201cEveryone else works as hard as they can, just like you do,\u201d Rishe said. \u201cRemember how it was for you at first? They all have to start somewhere. I hope you\u2019ll keep that in mind.\u201d\n\u201cThey\u2019re no different from me,\u201d Diana mumbled begrudgingly, glancing around the room, looking at the less experienced maids. As if coming to a decision, she said, \u201cI\u2019m sorry.\u201d\n\u201cDiana?\u201d\nLike a child enumerating her regrets, Diana went on, \u201cI\u2019ve done you wrong, all of you. It\u2019s just, I had nothing. Or so it felt like. No money, no title. I thought I had to make my way in the world on my own. That I had to start from zero.\u201d Her shoulders trembled as she buried her face in her hands. \u201cBut I was wrong! I wasn\u2019t starting from zero. I had everything that I learned growing up. I didn\u2019t realize how fortunate I was. I let it all go to my he\n \n\u201cRISHE IRMGARD WEITZNER! You are a vile woman! A truly malicious creature unworthy of the crown prince! As of this instant, our engagement is off!\u201d \n\u201cAs you wish, Your Highness.\u201d\n\u201c\u2026Huh?\u201d\nThe prince\u2019s declaration echoed throughout the ballroom. Rishe, the duke\u2019s daughter, bowed in response, her coral-toned hair swaying gracefully. The assembled guests found themselves captivated by her dignified beauty. Despite having just witnessed a broken engagement, they couldn\u2019t bring themselves to pity her.\nSlowly, Rishe lifted her head and fixed the prince with a pale-emerald gaze. It caught him off guard, but he quickly recovered.\n\u201cDidn\u2019t you hear what I just said?! I\u2019m calling off our engagement! Doesn\u2019t that trouble you?\u201d\n\u201cNot really.\u201d\nRishe already knew what happened next: false accusations, exile, and her family severing all ties and leaving her to survive on her own. She turned from the prince. There was no point wasting any time.\nThis is my seventh loop, after all.\nRishe had done this all before.\nThe next few hours will be busy. I must hurry and retrieve my things before I\u2019m barred from the family estate. I don\u2019t want this to be one of the times I\u2019m too slow and I have to start my new life with nothing.\n\u201cRishe, halt and hear me! I have spent the past week perfecting my recitation of your crimes!\u201d\nI should take more than dresses this time\u2014there\u2019s plenty of things I could use out in the world. What trade should I take up? In my first life, I was a merchant. In my second, an apothecary. I\u2019ve got a few more I want to try out\u2026 Augh! If time\u2019s just going to keep resetting, I wish I could start at an earlier point. I need more time to prepare!\n\u201cWait! Rishe!\u201d\nThe crown prince was on the verge of tears, and the spectators struggled to suppress their snickers. \nA thought occurred to Rishe, and she stopped. She then turned, her eyes gleaming beneath long lashes as she stared down her ex-fianc\u00e9. \u201cAh, Your Highness, I almost forgot.\u201d \n\u201cYes, tell me!\u201d the prince fumed. \u201cLet me guess, you are hurt beyond measure and yet love me still\u2026correct?\u201d\nAs if. Rishe was grateful to be granted her freedom. In fact, she was smiling as she said, \u201cI hope you and Lady Mary are happy together.\u201d\n\u201cWhat?!\u201d\n\u201cMay we both lead fulfilling lives. Farewell!\u201d Rishe lifted the skirts of her evening gown and turned on her heel, departing as briskly as she could.\n\u201cHow do you know about Mary? I haven\u2019t told you I love her!\u201d The prince was shouting something behind her, but she paid him no mind. She had things to do.\nDuring her first loop, the prince\u2019s accusations had shocked her to the core and she\u2014foolishly so\u2014had attempted to defend herself. Now she knew better than to expect the prince to behave reasonably. \nHow will life unfold this time? I\u2019m excited to find out! Rishe fixed her mind on the future.\nThis is my seventh \u201cdo-over.\u201d I\u2019ve led happy and carefree lives before, but this time\u2014this time, I swear I\u2019ll live a long happy and carefree life!\nIn other words, she needed to avoid getting killed. At any cost. \n \n***\n \nIn the first loop, with her engagement broken and her reputation in tatters, Rishe roamed with nothing but the clothes on jewelry. Finding them a good-natured band, she hitched a ride to a neighboring country.\nFrom the merchant caravan, she learned a trade, studying how to procure stock and balance ledgers. Eventually, she set out on her own to travel the world. Her upbringing as a daughter of the nobility meant that, even at fifteen years old, Rishe possessed a keen sense for beauty.\nShe collected things that caught her eye and sold them to whoever found delight in her wares. Before she realized it, she had become a major vendor, employing a full staff. She had even done business with the king of a desert nation and the prince of a frozen country up north. She traveled to many distant places, realizing a dream born from her cossetted former life spent doing nothing but preparing to be queen.\nFive years passed, and just as she had only one country left to visit, Rishe fell victim to the war sweeping across the continent.\nThe next thing she knew, she was fifteen years old again and back at that party, with the prince poised to make his pronouncement.\n\u201cRishe Irmgard Weitzner! You are a vile woman! A truly malicious creature unworthy of the crown prince! As of this instant, our engagement is off!\u201d\nNaturally, she didn\u2019t understand what was going on at first. She looked around. Everything was the same. She stood in the same place wearing the same dress and draped in the same jewelry she\u2019d sold to the caravan.\nWas it a dream? Or was everything",
    "query_text": " that had happened up until then the dream? In her confusion, all she could do was stare.\nRishe hurried out of the ballroom, the impending threat of exile hanging over her and the prince\u2019s entreaties to halt ringing in her ears.\nThis is perfect! Now"

Thanks for always being such a safe driver, Daniel!\u201d\nThe road to the manor was muddy from a morning rain shower. She knew from her second life that the coach would get stuck, resulting in a loss of valuable time. It was better to just get out and run. \n\u201cHuff, huff.\u201d Despite her last life\u2019s physical conditioning, this body had no stamina. She\u2019d need to try to get fitter faster this time around.\nRishe reached the end of the road, and her heart promptly sank all the way to her feet. \u201cOh no.\u201d\nThe front door was thronged with people, all of them surrounding a carriage bearing the royal family\u2019s coat of arms.\nI need to get out of here.\nWhile she stood frozen in indecision, one of the knights doing crowd control shouted, \u201cYour Highness! I have eyes on Lady Rishe!\u201d\n\u201cGet out of my way!\u201d A familiar voice started up a bellow. \u201cLet me through!

I\u2019d rather be barred from the house than see you again.\u201d\n\u201cHmm? What are you grumbling about?\u201d Dietrich looked Rishe up and down. \u201cI knew it. You put on a brave face, but I can sense the sorrow in your heart.\u201d\n\u201cI beg your pardon?\u201d\n\u201cYour heart!\u201d the prince repeated. \u201cYour heart! It must be absolutely crushed! Because I called off our engagement!\u201d\nRishe wasn\u2019t sure where he was drawing these conclusions from. Possibly the same place he mined for all his bottomless self-confidence.\n\u201cI can tell you\u2019ve been wandering aimlessly, distraught,\u201d the prince went on. \u201cLook at you. Your dress is caked in mud, your shoes are broken, and there are cuts marring your face and arms. What other possible cause could there be than heartbreak?\u201d\nRishe narrowed her eyes. \u201cDo you ever stop to think about the words coming out of your mouth?\u201d\n\u201cWhat?\u201d\nHis interpretation of events was fanciful to the point of absurdity. \u201cI did not dirty my dress or snap my shoes out of heartbreak. Because I feel none. You\u2019ve always been a little slow, so I\u2019ll make this clear: I do not have a single shred of fondness for you, or for our broken engagement.\u201d\n\u201cWhat?!\u201d the prince said. \u201cWhat are you saying?!\u201d\nThe surrounding crowd began to snicker.\n\u201cIsn\u2019t that the crown prince? Did Lady Rishe just dump him?\u201d\n\u201cWait, but wasn\u2019t he trying to dump her?\u201d\n\u201cCan\u2019t be! Look at her! She doesn\u2019t care at all!\u201d\n\u201cHow dare you nobodies make sport of me?\u201d Dietrich screeched. \u201cI am your prince!\u201d\nTemper aside, Dietrich was a handsome man. He had azure-blue eyes and blond hair\u2014a prince straight out of a picture book. His looks and place in the succession meant a never-ending swarm of women vying for his affections. He was brought up a pampered princeling, never wanting for anything. It manifested in a pompous manner and an overconfidence in his own abilities. Rishe had cautioned him about his attitude before, but he never paid her any mind.\nI\u2019m so glad I don\u2019t have to marry him.\nShe wished she could go back and tell the shocked, scared girl from her first life not to worry about her shattered engagement. Still, she might as well say it all here and now, with the assembled knights and citizens to bear witness.\n\u201cYour Highness, you exist to love and protect your people. It\u2019s unbecoming to speak of them in this manner.\u201d\n\u201cYou\u2019re the unbecoming one!\u201d the prince snapped. \u201cBeg me for forgiveness!\u201d\n\u201cI won\u2019t. Calling off our betrothal is the best course, and I applaud Your Highness for your good sense.\u201d\nNow even the knights were trembling with suppressed mirth. \nDietrich was turning red. \u201cD-don\u2019t laugh at me!\u201d\n\u201cLady Rishe,\u201d came a sweet voice. \u201cAren\u2019t you ashamed of yourself?\u201d \nRishe fought down a groan.\nOut of the crowd stepped a charming, dainty girl. Her big eyes moist with tears, she took her place at Dietrich\u2019s side. \u201cI do not allow the people I care about to be treated so very ill!\u201d \n\u201cWhy, Lady Mary. You\u2019re here.\u201d Rishe sighed. \u201cHow nice.\u201d\nThe young Mary scowled through her tears. Hidden behind her skirts, Dietrich continued to shout his disapproval. \u201cRishe! You\u2019ve brought my beloved Mary to tears! She\u2019s told me everything. How you bullied her, ridiculed her. How you find it amusing to lock her in the classroom overnight! Such a wicked woman could never be queen!\u201d\nNone of that\u2019s true.\nRishe glanced at Mary, who averted her gaze a little awkwardly.\n\u201cMore importantly,\u201d Rishe said, \u201chave you already brought your concerns to my parents, Your Highness?\u201d\n\u201cMore importantly?! I did, if you must know! Your parents are furious. They have vowed to disown you.\u201d\n\u201cAh. Then I\u2019m too late.\u201d Her parents held their reputation above all else. Rishe had little hope of retrieving any of her money or belongings now.\n\u201cWhy are you acting so strangely?\u201d Dietrich sniffed. \u201cAh, I understand. You\u2019re in such shock from this turn of events that\u2014\u201d\n\u201cListen, Dietrich.\u201d In her exasperation, Rishe dropped his title. \u201cI accept your decree. We are no longer engaged. I shall never darken your doorstep again. So\u2026relax a little.\u201d\n\u201cHuh? What are you saying?\u201d\n\u201cSince I was a child, I believed that my only value was in our betrothal. Being engaged to the crown prince was my whole reason for living. I was wrong about that. Only I determine my value\u2014no one else. That\u2019s why I don\u2019t care about this. I\u2019m beyond it.\u201d Rishe made sure to look him directly in the eye as she spoke. \u201cYou are an unnecessary element in my life.\u201d\nDietrich staggered back. His legs seemed to go out from",
    "query_text": " under him, and he crumpled. At that, the knights finally let go of their composure, laughing along with the courtiers.\n\u201cSt-stop!\u201d the prince wailed. \u201cYou are my subjects. This\u2026this shows such flagrant disrespect!\u201d\n\u201cDietrich, don\u2019t pay them any mind,\u201d Lady Mary said. \u201cLady Rishe, is this cruelty necessary?\u201d\n\u201cPerhaps this is a blessing in disguise.\u201d Rishe\u2019s attention moved to Mary, making the girl\u2019s slender shoulders jump. She had no reason to worry; Rishe didn\u2019t bite. \u201cI\u2019ve been wanting the opportunity to speak to you, Lady Mary. You\u2019re strong. I admire you very much.\u201d\n\u201cWhat are you talking about?\u201d\n\u201cYou\u2019re a lovely girl"

But now Rishe knew better. Her life was only just getting started, and the future held endless possibilities. After the horror of her sixth loop, she yearned for freedom.\nI don\u2019t want to marry him. I won\u2019t be anyone\u2019s captive. Still\u2026\nRishe, more than anyone, knew that the slightest adjustment could enact profound changes on the trajectory of a life. No doubt she\u2019d have many more lives, but this could be the only one where marriage to Arnold would be an option.\nThe dread emperor. The tyrant. The man who will stoke the fires of war. \nRishe knew the gossip, the endless conjecture behind Arnold Hein\u2019s bloody reign, but she didn\u2019t know the truth.\nWhy? The question had haunted her since her first life. She\u2019d never before had the chance to even speak to him.\nShe had wondered it as a merchant, hearing of the distant outbreak of war. She\u2019d wondered when the news of the dead and dying reached her apothecary. When she had comforted her terrified mistress in her life as a maid, assuring her everything would be all right. When she squared off against him in battle, as he plunged a sword through her heart\u2014even then she wondered. \nIf I stick around, maybe I\u2019ll finally have my answer. Half of her was dying to know. The other half didn\u2019t give a damn. And yet\u2026\nShe recalled a childhood dream. Rather, a longing.\nRishe let out a breath. \u201cYou claim you are enamored with me.\u201d\n\u201cYes. I am completely under your spell.\u201d\nTo think he could spout such nonsense with a straight face!\n\u201cThen will you grant me anything I desire?\u201d\n\u201cSo long as it is within my power,\u201d Arnold said. \u201cAnything you want will be yours.\u201d\nRishe hesitated, gathering her thoughts. \u201cI have some conditions.\u201d Arnold silently motioned for her to go on. \u201cI want full control over the wedding festivities. Everything must be procured through merchants of my choosing.\u201d\n\u201cFine.\u201d Arnold nodded. \u201cYou\u2019re free to do business with whomever you wish.\u201d\n\u201cAfter we are married, I must be in a position to mingle with guests from abroad.\u201d\n\u201cThat sounds within the purview of the crown princess. Anything else?\u201d\n\u201cI will be allowed to live in a separate residence from your mother and father.\u201d\nShe meant this seriously, but it made Arnold laugh. \u201cYou don\u2019t seem the type to worry about an overbearing mother-in-law.\u201d\n\u201cYou would be surprised. Combative relationships with one\u2019s new family are the most difficult part of marriage, or so they say. It could be a ramshackle cottage for all I care\u2014I just require a secondary residence.\u201d\nActually, Rishe didn\u2019t care at all about in-laws. When Arnold set his war into motion, his first move would be the assassination of his father. A genuine coup by patricide, not at all like Dietrich\u2019s clumsy attempt. Next, he would name himself emperor, take control of the country, and mobilize the military.\nSeparating him from his parents will make the first step more difficult\u2014although not impossible, unfortunately.\n\u201cAnything else?\u201d Arnold asked. \u201cI\u2019ll do whatever it takes to marry you.\u201d\n\u201cIdeally, I\u2019d like to know your endgame,\u201d Rishe said with dignity. \u201cBut as I doubt there\u2019s any chance of that, I have one final request.\u201d She jabbed a finger into his face, regardless of how rude it was. \u201cI will spend my time idling around the castle. No work, no study. I shall be utterly useless.\u201d\nLet\u2019s see just how much you want me as your princess.\nAfter a long moment of silence, Arnold cracked a merry laugh. The proposal remained; all her conditions were met.\n\n(2) chapter number given is likely out of range: 0\nChapter: 7\n\nChapter 2\nChapter 2\n \n\u201cYOU KNOW, it was only after I went into commerce that I truly had a dream for the future,\u201d Rishe had once confided in a friend. \u201cUp until then, I existed only as the crown prince\u2019s fianc\u00e9e or my father\u2019s daughter. My every act was to become more worthy of that status. But now, for the first time, I actually have a goal of my own.\u201d\n\u201cOh, yeah?\u201d her friend said. He was the ruler of the desert kingdom, and his smile was awfully charming. \u201cWhat\u2019s that?\u201d\nRishe smiled back. \u201cI want to travel to every single country in the world. I want to see everything in every town, peruse their markets, and meet the eyes of every person who lives there!\u201d\nBy now, that felt like such a distant dream.\n \n***\n \nRishe awoke with a start, eyes snapping open as she sensed a disturbance in the air.\nShe unsheathed her sword halfway, primed for danger. \nInside the coach, her old enemy sat across from her, one hand outstretched. \u201cWhat do you think you\u2019re doing?\u201d she demanded.\nWhen they\u2019d boarded the coach, Rishe had warned him not to lay a single finger on her throughout the trip to his kingdom. Ordering the prince not to touch his consort was absurd, but Arnold readily agreed. He had, after all, promised to follow her every direction.\nAnd yet, here he was, already breaking his promise.\nArnold appeared unperturbed by her glare. \u201cDon\u2019t look at me like that. I was merely trying to recover what you took from me.\u201d\nConfused, Rishe looked at the sword in her hand. It had a black lacquered scabbard with a simple golden decoration. Engraved on the hilt was the Galkhein crest.\n\u201cOh!\u201d Rishe thrust the sword back at Arnold. \u201cMy apologies.\u201d\nArnold chuckled. \u201cYou caught me off guard. You were nodding off, and then you suddenly snatched up my sword. You looked quite content snuggling up with it.\u201d\nArnold propped the sword beside him. Rishe pressed a hand to her chest to quell her racing heart. The sword that gutted me in my previous life is now my bedmate. What a world. Her recent stint as a knight had left her ill at ease without a blade at hand. She just couldn\u2019t believe it was Arnold\u2019s she\u2019d reached for.\n\u201cI didn\u2019t mean to disturb you, but I doubted sleeping with a weapon would be comfortable. I\u2019m impressed you sensed my intent before I even touched you.\u201d Arnold rested one elbow against the window frame, watching her with shameless fascination. \u201cOne only develops instincts like that from combat training. And you were also a member of the court? How in the world did you find the time?\u201d\nRishe shrugged. She couldn\u2019t just say, I pretended to be a man in a previous life, that\u2019s how.\n\u201cI assume there\u2019s more to you than your devotion to the sword. You seem to like flowers.\u201d\nShe followed Arnold\u2019s gaze to where she\u2019d bundled a small bouquet in a handkerchief. This was their fifth day on the road to Galkhein. Every day, without fail, she\u2019d picked flowers whenever they stopped to water the horses. The ones from today were still fresh, but the ones she\u2019d begun drying five days ago were just about ready.\n\u201cI didn\u2019t pick these because they\u2019re pretty.\u201d Rishe brought the blooms to her face, spirits rising at their sweet scent. Spring wildflowers had a soft and gentle smell. Rishe looked out the window at the forest spreading toward Galkhein, thinking of the rare native flowers going into bloom. She wished she could pick those as well, but that would cause too much delay. She gazed on wistfully.\nAfter watching her in silence for some time, Arnold said, \u201cBy the way, I sent one of my men ahead on a fast horse to deliver your order to the company you requested. They\u2019ll be invited to Galkhein to discuss the wedding ceremony.\u201d\n\u201cThank you,\u201d Rishe said. \u201cI\u2019m glad you kept your word.\u201d\n\u201cThe Aria Trading Company,\u201d Arnold mused. \u201cI\u2019ve heard of them. They\u2019re up-and-comers, aren\u2019t they? Have you done business with them before?\u201d\n\u201cNo, but I heard from a friend that they hold a very high standard of quality.\u201d\nRishe was pleasantly surprised at how easily Arnold had acceded to her request. Typically, a royal household had their own personal dealer. Getting them to do business with someone else could be difficult.\nI want to establish a connection with Aria as soon as possible, Rishe thought. It was, of course, the company that had taken her in during her first life.\nThe company had been established just two years prior to picking her up by its owner, a man named Tully. They were still in their growth stage, but in just a few years, they would be the grandest trading company in all the world. They\u2019d proven a great boon in her life as an apothecary as well, helping to distribute her newest medicines. She\u2019d struggled to win their trust initially, but she pledged to work much harder this time around.\nThis marriage isn\u2019t going to happen\u2014I need an escape plan for when it all falls apart. I must bring to bear all my knowledge and influence as a crown princess.\nRishe didn\u2019t know Arnold\u2019s plans, but she had no intention of sitting around and waiting for him to use her as he pleased. She\u2019d spend her time as his consort wisely. Everything must serve her ultimate goal: to live longer than five years, and live well.\nHer fierce determination must have shown on her face because Arnold gave her a little bemused smile. \u201cYes?\u201d\nGod! Rishe grimaced at that flawlessly handsome countenance. Such beauty, possessed by such powerful destruction. The fact that he\u2019d been the man to kill her did nothing to lessen her fascination. In fact, it almost made it worse. The study of contrasts.\n\u201cSorry, I just\u2014\u201d\nShe was interrupted by the horses\u2019 loud whinnies.\n\u201cStop! Hey, stop the coach!\u201d\nShouts drifted back from conveyance ahead of theirs, which contained the luggage and attendants. The squadron of knights tailing the column of coaches sped off toward the front.\n\u201cWho do you think you\u2014graaargh!\u201d\nThat didn\u2019t sound good. Rishe moved to climb out, but Arnold was faster. He drew his sword.\n\u201cHey!\u201d\nArnold locked the door from the outside. \u201cStay hidden.\u201d\nWhy is he putting himself in danger? That\u2019s what knights are for! The fact that Rishe had been about to do the same thing didn\u2019t occur to her. It\u2019s probably bandits. He told me to stay hidden in here, but I\u2019m not so sure about that.\nArnold had left her locked in from the outside, hoping to keep her safe, but Rishe didn\u2019t like her odds. There were five coaches, but this one was certainly the grandest. It locked on the inside as well, but that wouldn\u2019t stop someone with enough determination",
    "query_text": ". If she did as she was told, she\u2019d just be waiting patiently for a bandit to break a window and drag her out.\nKeeping one eye on the coachmen fleeing into the forest, Rishe began a methodical search for something to help her. Right\u2014her hairpin!\nThis sure brings me back. She unfastened it, twisting it into the gap in the door. Back when I was a maid, my lady would lock herself in her chambers all the time to avoid her studies. I had to break her out just like this.\nThe lock on the coach was simple, and it came open easily. Once she was free, she"

That\u2019s hardly the word I\u2019d use.\u201d\n\u201cGalkhein claims to value merit above all else, but in the end, people are judged by where they came from. Despite this, those men fought their way up from nothing.\u201d\nRishe paused in plucking the seeds from a flower and looked up at Arnold.\n\u201cThe men with the worst cases of the paralysis were all newly assigned. They\u2019ve spent weeks training to ensure this mission was a success. That older knight\u2014the one who bowed to you\u2014sustained an injury protecting the rookies. He cares deeply about his men.\u201d\n\u201cYou seem to care about them too,\u201d Rishe commented.\n\u201cI handpicked them for my retinue.\u201d Arnold clambered to his feet, only to fall into a bow. \u201cAnd you kept them safe. You have my deepest gratitude.\u201d\nRishe found herself at a loss for words. Was this Arnold putting on a mask to hide the monster within? Or was this the real him? She remembered the way he\u2019d looked when he held his blade to the bandit\u2019s throat, like a child poised to break a toy he had grown bored of.\n\u201cDon\u2019t mention it,\u201d Rishe said, uncomfortable. \u201cI knew how to do it, so I did.\u201d\nArnold laughed softly. \u201cBe that as it may, I\u2019d still count a noblewoman who can brew remedies from wildflowers by the side of the road a rare find.\u201d\n\u201cEarlier, when you grabbed my wrist\u2026\u201d Rishe steered the subject away from her incongruous knowledge. \u201cYou broke your promise. You said you wouldn\u2019t touch me.\u201d\n\u201cThat was reflex,\u201d Arnold protested. \u201cI thought you were going to hurt yourself.\u201d\nSuch a simple conversation, so casual. It had Rishe feeling positively peculiar.\n\u201cWhy are your knights so wary around me?\u201d she asked. \n\u201cWary? Oh, they were all at the palace when you broke your first engagement. They\u2019re most likely concerned I\u2019m bringing home a villainous jilt who will lead to my ruin. Something silly like that.\u201d\n\u201cI see.\u201d Apparently, being dumped by a prince called into question one\u2019s herbalist abilities.\n\u201cI\u2019m glad you mentioned it,\u201d Arnold went on, \u201cbecause there may be people in Galkhein who will oppose our union. I will do everything in my power to protect you, but you must bring any insults or threats to me right away.\u201d\n\u201cAre there likely to be many?\u201d\n\u201cIn theory, the crown prince may choose his own wife, but the done thing is, of course, to marry a princess. I assume a duke\u2019s daughter would have at least some ties to the royal family?\u201d\nHe assumed correctly. She was in the family tree, if a rather distant branch.\n\u201cMy father has ordered me to choose a bride from a different kingdom rather than a woman of my own land because\u2014\u201d\n\u201cOne never knows when a hostage will come in handy,\u201d Rishe finished for him.\nGalkhein was an expansionist empire. Currently, peace reigned\u2014but peace was precarious. If Galkhein demanded any of the countries to hand over a princess bride, then none were in a position to refuse. With his daughter in the hands of a foreign power, no king would dare oppose a war that power cared to wage.\n\u201cI sent a message to my father telling him I happened upon a close relation of Hermity\u2019s king\u2014a duke\u2019s daughter who had been recently tossed aside by her fianc\u00e9e,\u201d Arnold said. \u201cI also may have implied I was the reason for your falling out\u2014yours and the prince\u2019s. Why, when I saw a woman so powerful and connected and beloved, I couldn\u2019t help but plunder you.\u201d\n\u201cPlunder me? That\u2019s certainly one way to describe it.\u201d Dietrich had kicked up an almighty fuss, despite being the one who broke the engagement.\n\u201cMy father approves of you because he sees you as a bargaining chip. There will be others who aren\u2019t prepared to accept you so willingly.\u201d\n\u201cIs that so?\u201d Rishe said steadily.\n\u201cNever fear,\u201d Arnold responded. \u201cThey\u2019ll eat their words, every one of them. They will receive you as their crown princess if they value their\u2014\u201d\n\u201cNo, being a hostage is perfect.\u201d \nArnold stared at her. \u201cHm?\u201d\n\u201cAs a hostage, I\u2019ll have no official duties, will I? We can pretend I\u2019m here only under great duress, and there will be no need for my comment on governmental or diplomatic affairs.\u201d\nArnold hesitated. \u201cI suppose not.\u201d\n\u201cExcellent! Then I can live my dream of being utterly useless.\u201d Rishe trembled with delight. The thought of acting as an ambassador had really been weighing on her mind. Being a princess was nonstop work. Having been groomed for the position from an early age, Rishe knew members of the royal family barely even had time to sleep.\nBut prisoners didn\u2019t have places in government.\n\u201cThis is such a weight off my mind,\u201d Rishe admitted. \u201cThank you so much for keeping your promise, Your Highness.\u201d\n\u201cEr, of course.\u201d\n\u201cBut don\u2019t worry, I won\u2019t shirk my duties as wedding planner.\u201d Nearly ready to collapse with relief, Rishe returned to her herbs.\n \n***\n \nAfter the bandit incident, Rishe felt the knights begin to ease a bit in her presence.\nDespite their initial reluctance to accept her help, they continued to report the injured men\u2019s progress and bring any concerns directly to her. In return, they took over gathering herbs from the surrounding countryside on their rest stops.\nShe hadn\u2019t done it for gratitude, but she was nonetheless touched. Gathering medicinal herbs had been second nature ever since her life as an apothecary, and it was foolish to ever turn down loyalty.\nSeveral days after the altercation with the bandits, the coach train finally arrived in the imperial capital of Galkhein.\n\u201cOh my,\u201d Rishe murmured as they passed through the gates.\nWhite stone buildings stood in straight rows, lining clean, orderly streets. The first stories all appeared to be shops, while the second-floor windows were festooned with flowers. Everywhere she looked were smiling faces, citizens turned out to witness their prince\u2019s return over the smooth brick roads. Overlooking it all was the towering magnificence of the imperial palace.\n\u201cThe capital is the seat of power in Galkhein,\u201d Arnold explained. \u201cSeveral key trade routes converge here.\u201d\nRishe nodded, suddenly anxious to be out of the coach. More and more people were gathering to watch their progress, some carrying shopping bags in both arms or holding hands",
    "query_text": " with children. Many of them waved, as if greeting someone dear to them.\nHappy citizens and clean, orderly streets meant wealth. Galkhein was well-off. Rishe couldn\u2019t help but grin at an adorable little girl watching them roll by with sparkling eyes. When she saw Rishe\u2019s smile, she blushed and leapt up in the air, laughing with delight.\nThe coach made its way through the city before passing through the castle gates. Lines of disciplined knights flanked the road, ready to greet the crown prince and his fianc\u00e9e.\n"

    "prefix_text": " the offerings are made fresh every day.\u201d\n\u201cAmazing! And what about that pretty mountain over there?\u201d\nRishe tried and failed to contain her excitement. She couldn\u2019t help but imagine what seeing all these places up close would be like. The grand library, the beautiful church that told the time, and the morning market with fresh, delicious food\u2014she wanted to experience it all.\nSeeing Arnold\u2019s bemused face, she said, \u201cWhat?\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m just wondering where all this interest is coming from,\u201d he said. \u201cYou were so reluctant to come, yet here you are, brimming with curiosity for my city.\u201d\n\u201cWell\u2026\u201d she trailed off, unsure of how to respond.\nWhat should I say? Should I just tell him the truth?\nThis wasn\u2019t a secret, but talking about her hopes and dreams to the man who had killed her was a little awkward. A strange self-consciousness settled on her, her cheeks heating as she mumbled, \u201cBecause I\u2019ve always wanted to.\u201d\nArnold looked at her keenly. \u201cWanted to what?\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019ve always wanted to come here.\u201d\nDuring her life as a merchant, Rishe developed her single dream to visit everywhere in the world. That dream was cut tragically short when only one country remained: Galkhein.\nIn each of her consecutive lives, Rishe\u2019s priority became staying alive. Every time, without fail, just as she found her footing, the world was plunged into chaos. She never had the chance to see Galkhein. This betrothal was her chance. \u201cIt\u2019s probably why I agreed to marry you,\u201d she added after a moment\u2019s hesitation.\nArnold swept a tepid glance over the city. \u201cThere\u2019s nothing here worth seeing.\u201d\n\u201cThat\u2019s not true! The places you just told me about sound amazing! Your citizens are clean and happy, your knights are proper and kind. Oh, and another\u2014\u201d \nRishe broke off enumerating Galkhein\u2019s charms as Arnold turned to look at her. His face was impassively calm, but something seemed to pass by underneath, like a shadow in deep water.\n\u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d Rishe said. \u201cDid I say something odd?\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m just amazed you could be so unaware of yourself.\u201d \nWh-what a rude thing to\u2014\n\u201cI\u2019ve never met anyone like you. No one has ever spoken to me the way you do. I don\u2019t know any girls of your class with the knowledge or the physical abilities you possess. Noblewomen don\u2019t concern themselves with such things.\u201d\nRishe, there is no need for you to think for yourself.\nShe frowned. \u201cPerhaps you\u2019re right, but everything I\u2019ve learned is precious to me. No one can take my skills away\u2014I value them with my life. Some may say that my knowledge is worthless, but it makes no difference to me.\u201d She turned from the balcony, fixing him with a piercing gaze. \u201cI\u2019m the one who decides what I value.\u201d\nRishe had clawed free of her mother and father\u2019s indoctrination a long time ago. Man, woman\u2014it didn\u2019t matter. She could do anything. Being queen was not the culmination of her life; she wouldn\u2019t trade her freedom for anything.\nArnold matched her intensity. \u201cYou\u2019re right.\u201d He gently cupped her cheek in a one hand, swiping his thumb along the line of her jaw, smearing dust. \u201cLive your life here however you wish. I vow to do my utmost to protect you.\u201d\n\u201cHuh?\u201d\nHis vehemence took her by surprise. Arnold had every right to demand she act the part of a proper consort. This was a political marriage; Rishe was essentially a hostage, after all. Yet here he was, cosigning her misbehavior. Moreover, he was all but swearing to defend her from the consequences.\n\u201cWhy?\u201d\n\u201cYou know why. I\u2019m enamored with you.\u201d Arnold fed her the same line. \u201cI know you said you don\u2019t care about other people\u2019s approval, but I like your asymmetrical talents. I don\u2019t find them useless at all.\u201d \nRishe didn\u2019t know how to respond.\n\u201cI thought I\u2019d already made that clear.\u201d He took his hand back, drawing away, stopping just on the threshold. He turned back to a stunned Rishe and said, \u201cLet me know if there\u2019s anything you desire. I realize I just broke our agreement\u2014the one about not touching you.\u201d\nAnd with that, he was gone.\nShaken, Rishe sank to the floor of the balcony. I can\u2019t predict him at all! Just what is Arnold Hein planning?\nThe quiet of evening fell over the imperial capital of Galkhein.\n \n***\n \n\u201cMmm.\u201d\nSunshine streamed through the window as Rishe roused from sleep. She rolled over, basking in the morning light. The wall she expected wasn\u2019t there, and the bed seemed larger than usual. Taking advantage of it, she stretched out as far as she could.\nWas this her chamber at home? Or maybe she was a merchant again, spending a night at the desert king\u2019s palace. Perhaps this was her bed of straw from her life as a maid? Her memories met and interwove as she drifted into wakefulness.\nWhen Rishe finally opened her eyes, she grew even more confused.\nLight blue curtains surrounded the bed, thin enough to allow sunlight to pass through. She pulled them aside to find herself in a bare room devoid of furniture and carpet.\nOh, right. She didn\u2019t need to report for morning training, tend to her herb garden, prepare breakfast, or see how the bottles she had brewed overnight were coming along.\nRealizing that, Rishe buried her face in the pillow. \u201cSo soft,\u201d she murmured. \nJudging by the position of the sun, it was about six o\u2019clock in the morning. She was pretty sure she had gone to bed around midnight last night.\nI slept for six whole hours? Rishe couldn\u2019t believe it. Generally, she was used to getting about four hours of sleep. On bad days, at the height of an emergency as a knight or apothecary, she wouldn\u2019t even get that much. \nI\u2019ve got nothing but cleaning on the schedule today. Hostages can sleep in, right? At least a little? Excitement suffused her at the thought, but that was interrupted by a knock on the door.\n\u201cLady Rishe, are you awake? It\u2019s Oliver\u2014Prince Arnold\u2019s attendant.\u201d\nRishe sat up with a start. \u201cI\u2019m awake!\u201d\nOliver continued to speak through the door. \u201cI apologize for bothering you at such an early hour. I\u2019m here with a delivery.\u201d\n\u201cJust a moment!\u201d Rishe slipped out of the bed, dressed quickly, and tugged the bed\u2019s canopy closed. She opened the door to find Oliver standing in the hallway with a polite smile.\nHe apologized again. \u201cThis was the only time I could slip away from His Highness\u2019s office. I\u2019m glad to see that you\u2019re already dressed.\u201d\n\u201cNot at all.\u201d Rishe paused, stepping back to allow him inside. \u201cOh my. You look exhausted.\u201d\nOliver grimaced. \u201cIs it that obvious? We\u2019ve been climbing through mountains of paperwork, but never mind me. His Highness has been working around the clock.\u201d\nRishe thought back to yesterday, how he had come all the way out to the balcony. He should have used that spare time to sleep. \u201cHe\u2019s in high demand, isn\u2019t he? He was even working on the trip over.\u201d\n\u201cHe finished all the work he brought along with us,\u201d Oliver confirmed. \u201cNow he\u2019s dealing with everything that piled up during his visit to Hermity.\u201d\n\u201cOh.\u201d Rishe grimaced in sympathy. He may have killed her in a past life, but she wouldn\u2019t wish the bureaucracy of kingship on anyone. \u201cIt\u2019s a shame he had to put his work on hold to attend a silly engagement party.\u201d\n\u201cNo matter. That party was how a committed bachelor finally found a bride.\u201d\nHis smile was sincere, but Rishe knew better. She spread her arms. \u201cGo on. Shall I spin around so you have a better view?\u201d\nOliver blinked. \u201cI beg your pardon?\u201d\n\u201cYou\u2019re looking me over like I\u2019m a horse for sale. If there\u2019s anything I can help you with, please let me know.\u201d\nOliver\u2019s brows went up. He let out a little breath of resignation. \u201cHis Highness was right. You do possess the keen perception of a knight. Of course, I\u2019m purely an amateur myself.\u201d\nI\u2019d say this was a merchant\u2019s sixth sense, rather than battle intuition.\nThis wasn\u2019t the first time Rishe had caught Oliver looking at her. It reminded her of the way her noble customers would examine a product, assessing worth and authenticity. Or a merchant weeding out potential merchandise from a wide array of choices.\nIn other words, he was appraising her.\nOliver moved into a deep, sweeping bow. \u201cMy sincerest apologies, my lady. I have been unaccountably rude to my lord\u2019s consort. My behavior was unacceptable.\u201d\nRishe shook her head. \u201cPlease don\u2019t, it\u2019s fine.\u201d It wasn\u2019t unreasonable for the prince\u2019s closest attendant to be wary of strangers. But it did make her curious. \u201cHow long have you worked for Arnold? Have you always been a valet?\u201d\n\u201cI trained as a squire, actually,\u201d Oliver replied. \u201cBut I was injured and dismissed from the order. His Highness took me into his household soon after. I have served him for nearly a decade.\u201d\n\u201cThen maybe you can answer this,\u201d Rishe said. \u201cWhy is Prince Arnold so very intent on making me his wife?\u201d\nOliver hesitated, as if weighing the pros and cons of speaking, \u201cTo be quite honest, I was as surprised as you were. He\u2019s always insisted he had no interest in marriage. But the sight of you in Hermity has changed his mind. Apparently.\u201d\nSo not even his attendant understood his motives. Rishe remained at a complete loss.\n\u201cIf I may, however?\u201d Oliver mistook Rishe\u2019s confusion for anxiety and added, \u201cI have served Prince Arnold for a long time, and never before have I seen him so happy. When he is with you, he laughs. His smiles are sincere.\u201d\nRishe was taken aback. She\u2019d figured all of Arnold\u2019s laughter and teasing was at her expense. His own private jokes.\n\u201cAre you\u2026unhappy with him?\u201d Oliver ventured. \u201cWith his looks, His Highness is exceedingly popular with the ladies of the court, you know.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m sure he has many admirers.\u201d She paused. \u201cWould you really call the way he acts around me \u2018happy\u2019? To me, it seems more like a cat with a mouse.\u201d\nOliver laughed. He didn\u2019t deny it. \u201cI am pleased you understand His Highness so well. Oh, I nearly forgot. Here.\u201d\nHe held out a sheaf of three documents. \u201cThis is the guest list for your wedding. His Highness bids you look over it.\u201d\n\u201cThank you,\u201d Rishe said, pleasantly surprised. She hadn\u2019t even needed to ask. She gave it a quick glance, quickly identifying the most prominent and powerful names.\nKing Zahad, Prince Kyle, Princess Harriet. And from the Kingdom of Domana, we have Lord Jonal attending as the representative of the king. No surprise there.\nMore than a wedding guest register, this was a list of key people from the countries Arnold would go on to antagonize. Even before the murder of the king and the start of the war, there must have been a trigger\u2014a sea change in the affairs of state. Everyone on this list was most likely involved.\nKing Zahad. I hope we can be friends again like in my first life. Hmm\u2026 Prince Kyle is rather frail. I hope he isn\u2019t working himself too hard. He has a strong sense of responsibility\u2014he\u2019ll attend the wedding even though it\u2019ll be a long trip.\nThe sight of these names filled Rishe with a longing for those lives, for the people she\u2019d once known. And sometime in the very near future, they would all be Galkhein\u2019s enemies.\nIf I take matters into my own hands, perhaps I can salvage some of these relationships before they sour. Even if we aren\u2019t allies, we don\u2019t have to be enemies. Anything to stave off the outbreak of war.\nOliver had no idea what was going through Rishe\u2019s head. Brightly, he continued their conversation. \u201cThe ceremony will be held in three months\u2019 time. All preparations must be complete by then. And now\u2026we need to discuss tonight\u2019s party.\u201d\n\u201cTonight\u2019s what?\u201d\nOliver stiffened. \u201cDid His Highness not tell you?\u201d\n\u201cNo, he most certainly did not! There\u2019s to be a party?\u201d\n\u201cUgh, not again!\u201d Oliver dug his knuckles into his forehead.\nRishe put two and two together. She hesitated, then said, \u201cSo there is one, then. As you must know, His Highness is trying to stamp it down without telling me.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d Oliver replied. \u201cHe should have mentioned it to you. You don\u2019t need to attend, but he will. At least, I hope he will. I",

Under normal circumstances, it would be unheard of for the crown prince and his fianc\u00e9e to fail to appear at a banquet. \u201cDon\u2019t worry, Oliver. I\u2019ll go.\u201d\nOliver let out a sigh of relief. \u201cReally? Thank you so much, my lady. I\u2019ll put finding you a maid at the top of my to-do list.\u201d\n\u201cNo need.\u201d Rishe smiled. \u201cI can prepare for the party on my own.\u201d\nThis maid-selection process made Rishe uneasy. After witnessing that exchange between the servants in the garden, she imagined quarrels breaking out all through the palace. And she doubted the disputes would go away even after they decided.\nOliver frowned. \u201cBut won\u2019t dressing be difficult without a"

    "prefix_text": " to find his jet-black sword blooming out of her chest.\nShe remembered how it burned, as if the blade was made of fire. It was heat, not pain, but her breathing grew labored, and when Emperor Arnold Hein withdrew his sword, Rishe crumpled. \nHe knelt by her side and whispered something.\nThe words were seared into her memory. Rishe squeezed Arnold\u2019s hand as they danced.\nI\u2019ll be the bully this time. \nRishe shifted her weight back, slipping out of the hold on her waist. She broke Arnold\u2019s lead and spun, drifting on the harmony of the dance. She took him by surprise; his eyes went wide.\nI wonder what you\u2019ll do when you\u2019re no longer on top, Your Highness. Her smile was a declaration of war. Watching him attempt to follow her lead would be delightful. She pulled his hand toward her, attempting to move them into a spin.\nBut Arnold held fast. He planted his hand on her waist and turned them in a different direction, using her inertia against her. Hey! As a result, Rishe twirled by herself on the spot.\nShe didn\u2019t miss a step. She turned elegantly, the hem of her dress whispering across the ballroom floor. She heard appreciative murmurs from the wallflowers lined up watching.\nDespite that, Rishe took it as a defeat. Round one to Arnold. \nSo\u2026you can think on your feet. How about this?\nArnold remained unruffled, evading her next scheme like it was nothing. He grinned down at her, his eyes shining with a dare.\nHe thinks I can\u2019t beat him. His ease vexed her, but it was his smugness that made her angry.\nShe let out a hard breath, attempting a maneuver to lure him in while turning. He leaned back, not falling for it at all.\nHe\u2019s just too good at changing his center of gravity! She kept her astonishment under wraps, but she felt it. Despite how close we\u2019re dancing, I can\u2019t throw off his timing at all. He\u2019s sidestepped all my attempts, and he takes back the lead the second I let down my guard!\nIt made her increasingly angry. She twirled and stepped as the dance dictated, all the while feeling out for moments of weakness. Arnold played along with her game, completely unruffled.\nEvery single time. I\u2019m doing my utmost to trip him up, but he doesn\u2019t even seem annoyed! At this point she\u2019d just settle for any reaction at all.\nTheir unusual dance style had gathered a crowd. Rishe paid them no mind, focused only on her goal. Then something occurred to her, and her breath caught in her throat.\nWait a minute, he has left an opening. It\u2019s the same one from before. She thought back to their fight to the death, to that moment when she had managed to draw blood. That may indeed have been his only weakness.\nIf I strike the same way\u2014huh? Before she could try, Arnold appeared to lose patience, wrapping his arm around her waist. He bent her back into a dip so deep it felt like he\u2019d pulled a carpet from under her feet. She yelped, grabbing at him reflexively, clinging tight. His big hands gripped her securely enough to mitigate the sensation of falling. Relief flooded through her, and she felt a laugh rumble against her ear.\nThe music came to an end with one last ringing note. She blinked. The dance is over?\nA hush fell over the ballroom. Then cheers broke out, followed by a round of applause.\n\u201cThat was incredible!\u201d\nThe watching nobles crowded in.\n\u201cYou two moved in such perfect harmony!\u201d\n\u201cI was on the edge of my seat. I felt like I was watching a sword duel!\u201d\n\u201cIs this a dance from Hermity? I\u2019ve never seen such steps before.\u201d\n\u201cUh, well\u2026\u201d Rishe floundered. She glanced up at Arnold, who appeared to be enjoying her struggle. She\u2019d get no help from him.\nRishe dealt with the barrage of questions as best she could, letting the crowd sweep them into the dining room, which was set up for a buffet-style meal. She made sure to greet every guest, riveting their faces into her memory.\nShe must have been acting peculiar, because Arnold eventually said, \u201cRishe, I think the wine is getting to you. Shall we get some fresh air?\u201d\nRishe hadn\u2019t touched a single drop. In fact, she\u2019d been caught up in so many conversations that she hadn\u2019t even had the chance to eat, but she had experience working on an empty stomach. She accepted Arnold\u2019s encouragement as the escape it was.\nJust when I least expect it, he\u2019ll act the gentleman. Maybe he\u2019d remembered her demand for a carefree life of doing nothing.\nRishe cast a charming look across the crowd. \u201cThank you for your consideration, Your Highness. Forgive me.\u201d She gave a polite bow before quietly slipping away. \nShe didn\u2019t head straight to the balcony but rather slowly walked around the hall. There was only so much she could find out glued to Arnold\u2019s side all night.\nI need information. Galkhein\u2019s political landscape was a mystery to me through all my past lives. I only know the rumors that made it abroad.\nAlthough she knew of Arnold\u2019s eventual patricide, she had no concept of the circumstances leading up to it. She needed a better picture of the factions and power balance inside the court. The lives these people led.\nI know better than to believe wartime gossip. This Arnold Hein is a lot different from what I\u2019d heard he was like at nineteen. He\u2019s not as diabolical as the rumors led me to believe. He likes to push, but he isn\u2019t unkind. The thought drifted across her mind, leaving her conflicted. Well, he\u2019s not unkind now. But I still don\u2019t like not knowing his motives. And he\u2019s a bit of a jerk, to be honest. \nShe tried to settle her mind and just observe. Gathering intelligence was necessary to lead a long, carefree life lazing around the palace.\nIf I recall correctly, that\u2019s Lord Hannawald. He seems to be on good terms with Count Gayle. Duke Hudemann and Duke Teinitz are having a friendly enough conversation, yet they don\u2019t seem close. Rishe ticked off the names of people she\u2019d met, committing them to memory.\nA wave of sweet perfume wafted over her. A pretty girl with soft blonde hair had appeared at her side. \u201cHow do you do, Lady Rishe? I\u2019m Cornelia Thea Toona.\u201d\nDuke Toona\u2019s family was the thirty-first house she\u2019d met tonight.\nRishe smiled graciously. \u201cRishe Irmgard Weitzner. A pleasure to meet you.\u201d\n\u201cThe pleasure is all mine.\u201d Cornelia smiled sweetly. Her eyes were big and bright, her lips full. She held a glass in each hand and offered one to Rishe. \u201cWine? I see you\u2019re empty-handed.\u201d\nA gaggle of other ladies nearby began giggling among themselves.\n\u201cHow dare she act so haughty when she\u2019s a captive. It\u2019s time for her learn just what she is. A pawn to be played and discarded.\u201d\n\u201cShe should enjoy her time on Prince Arnold\u2019s arm while she can.\u201d\n\u201cShe is from a minor nation, after all.\u201d\nAs Rishe took note of their whispers, Cornelia gazed at her with doe eyes. \u201cDoes my offering offend you in some way?\u201d\nIf I remember correctly, House Toona holds a vast territory in southern Galkhein.\nRishe held out a hand to accept the glass. \u201cHow could it? Thank you, Lady Cornelia.\u201d\nBefore Rishe could touch the glass, Cornelia gave a dramatic shout. \u201cOh dear! My hand slipped!\u201d She dropped it, quite obviously on purpose. Without thinking, Rishe grabbed her skirts and leaned back, plucking the glass out of the air with the other hand.\nCornelia let out a cry of surprise as Rishe caught the wine before any could spill. She swirled the glass and brought it to her nose to breathe in the bouquet.\nHmm\u2026 That\u2019s mashed capsicum. Where did she even get that? What a waste of perfectly good wine. And why bother spicing it enough to singe the tongue if she just planned to ruin my dress? Pick a plan, my dear.\nHiding her exasperation, Rishe smiled brightly. \u201cI\u2019ve never had a wine quite like this. What an unusual scent.\u201d\nCornelia bit her lip in frustration. Rishe beamed at her. You\u2019ve got such a pretty face, Lady Toona. Why don\u2019t you smile?\nRishe leaned in close to Cornelia. \u201cThis vintage isn\u2019t available where I\u2019m from. I\u2019m ever so anxious to learn more. Should I perhaps invite Prince Arnold over to enjoy a glass? Which tray did you get this from?\u201d\n\u201cWhat? Oh, um\u2026\u201d Rishe had a policy of never backing down from a fight, but it seemed Cornelia didn\u2019t share it. \u201cS-sorry, but I don\u2019t remember. Such a large hall, you see.\u201d\n\u201cA shame. I\u2019ll just give His Highness this one, then. I\u2019ll be sure to let him know who it\u2019s from.\u201d\n\u201cUh, wait!\u201d Cornelia rapidly shook her head. \u201cI-I got that glass for you, so I think you should\u2014you know what? Never mind! Maybe I should just take that\u2014oh no!\u201d\nRishe ignored the ashen-faced Cornelia, raising the glass and swallowing down a gulp. \n\u201cI-I can\u2019t believe\u2026\u201d\n\u201cSuch a spicy flavor, just as I imagined.\u201d Rishe smiled again to the assembled group\u2019s astonishment. \u201cWhat a warm welcome. I do hope the two of us can spend more time together. Perhaps\u2026a tea party?\u201d\n\u201cTh-the two of us?\u201d Cornelia stammered.\n\u201cYes. I want to know all about House Toona.\u201d\nCornelia looked flabbergasted, but she recovered herself and nodded.\nThat should do. One of Rishe\u2019s eventual plans required a plot of land in a temperate climate. House Toona\u2019s would likely be perfect, but she needed to confirm a few things with Cornelia. Never back down from a fight. Even further\u2026\nShe recalled the words of her mentor from her days as a merchant.\nDon\u2019t bother with fights you can\u2019t win.\nThe other ladies fled, fearful of this strange girl who gulped down painfully spicy wine like it was nothing. \n \n***\n \nRishe retreated to the empty balcony to enjoy the music, grimacing with every stinging mouthful of wine. She drank it in decreasing sips until Arnold joined her.\n\u201cWhat are you making that face for?\u201d\nRishe swirled the glass. \u201cDon\u2019t worry, it\u2019s not you. It\u2019s just this wine is so spicy.\u201d\n\u201cSpicy? The wine is?\u201d\n\u201cMm. It\u2019s seasoned with capsicum. I barely managed to get that first mouthful down without gagging.\u201d\nArnold swiped the glass from her hand. \u201cDon\u2019t tell me this was a poisoning attempt!\u201d\nRishe clicked her tongue in annoyance at her own lack of vigilance. No one else would be able to grab something from her so easily.\nArnold glared at the wine. \u201cYou don\u2019t need to drink this. I\u2019ll get rid of it.\u201d\n\u201cHey, give that back! They ruined a perfectly good glass of wine because of me. I\u2019m not going to waste it.\u201d She grabbed it back and took another sip, shuddering at the taste.\nArnold glowered. \u201cTell me who did this. I\u2019ll have them executed.\u201d\n\u201cDon\u2019t be ridiculous. You don\u2019t kill people like her\u2014you use them.\u201d Just the tiniest bit of wine to go, but it was getting harder to make herself drink it. She gave the glass a reproachful look, then glanced back at Arnold. \u201cOh, and I owe you an apology.\u201d\n\u201cDo you?\u201d\n\u201cI used your name to defend myself.\u201d The girls had only backed off when she threatened to tattle to Arnold. Rishe found that sort of thing inelegant in the extreme, and she was embarrassed.\nArnold sighed at Rishe\u2019s apologetic bow. \u201cThere\u2019s nothing wrong with a wife invoking her husband\u2019s name.\u201d\nRishe hesitated. \u201cWe\u2019re not married yet.\u201d\n\u201cThat\u2019s a formality. It\u2019s as good as done, if you ask me.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2026see.\u201d\nHe took her distraction as an opportunity to swipe her glass back. Instead of dumping it out, Arnold gulped the rest of it down. \n\u201cDamn, that packs a punch,\u201d he grumbled.\n\u201cI told you that!\u201d Rishe snapped. \u201cAre you all right? Let me get you some water!\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m fine. But now you\u2019ve fulfilled your obligation to the wine, haven\u2019t you?\u201d\nRishe didn\u2019t know what to say. He\u2019d helped her\u2014not by taking charge but by following her lead. Without cutting her down and telling her she was being foolish. Without rolling his eyes and dismissing her desires as trifles.\n\u201cThank you,\u201d Rishe said stiffly, which just made him laugh.\n\u201cWhat were you thinking about when we were dancing?\u201d he asked.\n\u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d\n\u201cYou were thinking about someone else, weren\u2019t you? Who?\u201d\nRishe didn\u2019t know a delicate way to say I was thinking about a future version of you I met in another life.\n\u201cHmm?\u201d His tone was oddly light, teasing even. But the gleam in his hunter\u2019s eyes said she wouldn\u2019t get away so easily.\nObviously, Rishe couldn\u2019t give him an honest answer. \u201cI wasn\u2019t thinking about anyone else. I was worried about you.\u201d\n\u201cWhy?\u201d\nThis was the closest she could come to the truth. \u201cWere you injured here?\u201d She patted her own left shoulder with her forefinger. \nArnold went silent. His left shoulder was slightly slower to react than his right\u2014if his right was at one hundred, then his left was at maybe ninety-eight. It was hardly noticeable, but Rishe had picked up on it. He was right-handed, and she wouldn\u2019t have noticed it if they\u2019d been dancing normally. \nThat, and if it hadn\u2019t been for memories from her past life.\nRishe had only managed to inflict a single injury on him. An instant, a moment\u2019s hesitation where she saw her chance and slashed left. Of course, he\u2019d shrugged off the injury and effortlessly run her through. \n\u201cHeh.\u201d Arnold finally broke his silence with grim laughter. His eyes sent shivers down her spine, cold and bewitching. In lieu of an answer, he reached for his collar, unfastening the clasp with a snap and drawing his jacket open with a rough tug.\nOh my.\nRishe drew in a breath. A great scar was engraved into the nape of his neck, just low enough to be concealed by clothing. It looked several years old. \u201cIt\u2019s an old wound. It continues to the top of my shoulder and pulls the skin taut.\u201d\n\u201cHow awful.\u201d Rishe couldn\u2019t help but reach out to gingerly touch the nape of his neck.\nArnold accepted her touch without a word. She\u2019d half expected to be slapped aside.\nHer fingers slowly traced the shape of it. She could feel the rough skin through her gloves.\nHe must have gotten this over a decade ago. Someone stabbed him\u2014and not just once or twice. They must have done it over and over to make this scar pattern.\nHer medical training had her shuddering at the image of a nine-year-old Arnold ashen and trembling with blood loss. The fact that he\u2019d survived and retained the use of his arm was incredible. And then to go on to wield a sword so skillfully\u2014his suffering must have been immense.\n\u201cOnly a few people know about this injury. You\u2019re the first to notice on your own.\u201d\n\u201cHow did it happen?\u201d\nThat grim smile returned as he looked down at Rishe. With the moon hanging behind him, he was as opaque as ever, but Rishe understood the sentiment.\nI shouldn\u2019t pry.\nRishe pulled her hand away, and that ominous smile that sent chills down her spine disappeared. Arnold put his jacket back in order, reclasping it at the neck.\nSomeone tried to kill Arnold Hein about ten years ago. But who and why? Rishe cast her eyes down as she ruminated. The most obvious beneficiaries of a dead crown prince would be potential heirs and those loyal to them. I believe Arnold has a younger brother, but I haven\u2019t met him yet.\nOdd. Rishe might be a hostage, but shouldn\u2019t she meet her future relatives? Perhaps it was Arnold\u2019s doing and not the will of the imperial family themselves. He didn\u2019t seem to want to involve her in anything unless it was absolutely necessary\u2014he hadn\u2019t told her about this ball, after all. \nRishe looked up at him. \u201cYour Highness, may I select my maids some time over the next few days?\u201d \n\u201cVery well. I\u2019ll tell Oliver to make that a priority.\u201d\n\u201cAh, I can do the selection myself. We needn\u2019t trouble him.\u201d\nArnold arched an amused brow. Gone was that unsettling smile, replaced with his easy manner. \u201cWhat are you planning this time?\u201d\n\u201cOh, nothing important,\u201d Rishe said. She picked up her empty glass. \u201cI\u2019m merely concerned about the servants\u2019 working conditions.\u201d\nTo protect her life and well-being, she needed to keep from dying at twenty years old again. And to do that, she had to prevent Arnold Hein\u2019s war. Her best bet would be to appeal to the important people she\u2019d known in her past lives. People with influence.\nPlus, there was a mountain of things she needed to do in preparation for the marriage ceremony.\nI need to sow a plot of land, grow herbs, do lots of shopping, get cheap alcohol, and then\u2026 \nRishe began a to-do list that had nothing to do with war in the least.\n \n***\n",

That impertinent newbie didn\u2019t get picked.\u201d \nAt her friend\u2019s observation, Diana preened with satisfaction. \u201cNo surprise there. You need some manners to attend to Lady Rishe. I bet she got kicked out of the running!\u201d Her eyes sparkled with confidence.\nAt last, there was a knock at the door.\n\u201cHer Royal Highness, Princess Rishe.\u201d\nThe maids quickly fell into bows. Diana\u2019s chest ached with anticipation as heels clicked on the floor, approaching the line of girls. From the corner of their eyes, the maids saw a wide-skirted court dress. A gentle scent washed over them.\nWithout even looking at her, they could tell Crown Princess Rishe was a lovely woman. Diana and her friends swelled with pride that she was to become their mistress.\nBut then Laura whispered to Diana, \u201cHey, isn\u2019t this scent familiar?\u201d\n\u201cQuiet!\u201d Clearly it was some sort of expensive perfume. Or so Diana thought, but then she realized what it was. The words just slipped out. \u201cIt\u2019s soap.\u201d\n\u201cHuh? Did you just say something?\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s soap. The same kind we always use.\u201d Diana was sure of it.\nThe princess said, \u201cPlease rise.\u201d \nWhy did her voice sound so familiar? An incredible foreboding gripping her, Diana looked up. She gasped.\n\u201cMy name is Rishe Irmgard Weitzner.\u201d\nBefore her stood the beautiful newcomer\u2014the thorn in her side for the past few days. The smile she wore was peaceful and just the slightest bit satisfied.\n \n***\n \nI\u2019m so glad I managed to finish washing the sheets in time!\nStanding before the maids with Arnold\u2019s attendant Oliver at her side, Rishe was panicking on the inside. She\u2019d had so much to do this morning that she\u2019d put off the laundry to the last minute. She took deep, controlled breaths, praying no one would notice that she\u2019d raced here at a dead sprint.\nOliver was none the wiser as he spoke to the assembled girls. Rishe took the opportunity to look them over. She locked eyes with Elsie, who was gaping at her. It was a nice change\u2014usually her face was as blank as a rock wall.\nI\u2019m sorry for the deception. I figured blending in would give me the best picture of your working conditions.\nThe new maids wore similarly shocked expressions, while others watched her with delight. Meanwhile, the veterans, including Diana, had all gone pale. They trembled, stunned into silence. One seemed locked in a terrifying trance, while another looked on the verge of tears. All of them had spoken to Rishe with derision. As the ringleader, Diana was covering her mouth with both hands, like she was holding in a scream.\nOliver had finished his introduction. \u201cYour Highness, if you would?\u201d\nRishe stepped forward. \u201cFirst, I must apologize to you for what has transpired prior to this meeting. My deception, that is. However, it has granted me insight into how each one of you works.\u201d\nOliver\u2019s face creased in confusion. The newcomer maids began to panic, whispering among themselves.\n\u201cDoesn\u2019t this mean that she helped us out with the laundry?\u201d\n\u201cWe\u2019re going to be fired!\u201d\n\u201cIf I lose my position, my brother will have to quit school!\u201d\nNoticing the commotion, Oliver glanced at Rishe. \u201cYour Highness, two-thirds of these maids are newly recruited from the city. Since the majority of the castle maids were elderly, His Highness assumed you would prefer maids closer in age to yourself.\u201d\nRishe was startled. She had found it odd that most of her potential servants were new hires, but she hadn\u2019t expected this to be the reason.\n\u201cWhile the prince has entrusted the selection of your maids to you,\u201d Oliver went on. \u201cHiring someone with no experience will not do. Despite Prince Arnold\u2019s views, I urge you to reject the newcomers.\u201d\n\u201cOliver.\u201d\n\u201cI have a list of their names here. Elsie\u2014\u201d\n\u201cElsie, Nichole, Hilde, Marguerite, Rosa.\u201d Rishe began listing the names of the newly recruited maids. She\u2019d made a point to memorize them in the washhouse. \u201cElke, Amelia, and\u2014\u201d\nOliver looked at her wildly. \u201cYou know them all?! Even though they\u2019ve never served you in the past?\u201d\n\u201cYes, of course I do. Servants are essential to the maintenance of our lifestyle, why wouldn\u2019t I get to know them?\u201d Rishe listed the remaining names for good measure. \u201cAll twenty of you, listen to me.\u201d \nThe new maids stiffened. Diana and the other maids whose names hadn\u2019t been called were getting their wind back, wearing increasingly triumphant looks.\nRishe said, \u201cThe twenty names I just called will be my maids.\u201d\nTime seemed to stand still a moment, and then Oliver broke in with an astonished, \u201cB-but, my lady! They are all inexperienced\u2014\u201d\n\u201cYes. And my palace will be the perfect place to learn.\u201d\nThe new recruits were completely speechless, unsure of exactly what was happening. \nRishe smiled at Elsie. \u201cI hope you\u2019ll serve me well, Elsie.\u201d\nElsie was still frozen in place. \u201cHuh? Y-yes, my lady, but\u2014\u201d\nA shaking Diana cried out, \u201cBut why, my lady?! You\u2019ve seen their work! They\u2019re useless, the lot of them! The rest of us get so much more done in a shorter amount of time!\u201d\n\u201cWatch your tongue, girl,\u201d Oliver said sharply.\nDiana ignored him. \u201cWe\u2019re hard workers! Any job you assign us, we can do it! Please, I beg you, my lady!\u201d\n\u201cStep back,\u201d Oliver warned. \u201cDo not take a single step closer to Lady Rishe.\u201d\nDiana spoke in a rush, words pouring out of her. \u201cI-I freely admit that I was impolite before, but I didn\u2019t know who she was! I\u2019ll take any punishment, so please, give me the chance to show you how well I can work!\u201d\nRishe said, \u201cDiana, I have a request.\u201d\n\u201cTh-thank you, my lady!\u201d Diana heaved a sigh of relief. \u201cYou mean you\u2019ll\u2014\u201d \nRishe cut across her. \u201cAs of today, you are no longer a maid in this palace.\u201d \n\u201cWhat?\u201d Her face, usually so fixed with determination, paled. \u201cBut why? I\u2019m so much better than any of them! I\u2019ll do a perfect job no matter what task you set before me. Please don\u2019t dismiss me, my lady!\u201d \n\u201cListen to me, Diana.\u201d",

How difficult it was?\u201d\nDiana looked completely bewildered. Her gaze darted around as if looking for help.\nPulling herself together, she forced herself to follow Rishe\u2019s directions.

She remembered this from the battlefield\u2014how his attention alone felt like a sword thrust.\nBut why even bother to lie? They\u2019d never meet again, so who cared what he thought of her? Sure, she harbored a hard feeling or two over the recent slaying, but there was no point complaining about it to this Arnold. Calling him the emperor was boorish, but Rishe was in the process of being forcibly exiled. Why play at diplomacy?\nShe took a deep breath and bowed low. This was not the curtsy of a noble lady but of a servant bowing in supplication to her master.\n\u201cMy humblest apologies, Your Highness. I was in a rush. Such a rude slip of the tongue.\u201d She raised her head. \u201cMy ex-fianc\u00e9 just annulled our engagement, so I\u2019ve got a lot on my mind. If you would excuse me.\u201d \n\u201cHe annulled your engagement?\u201d\nAt that, Rishe turned and fled.\nThis unexpected run-in with Arnold had taken up valuable time. She threw open the door to the balcony and hiked up her skirts, kicking off her shoes in anticipation of jumping into a tree. Looking down, she realized the ground was far closer than she\u2019d feared.\nExcellent! I can just drop into the garden!\nArnold, who up until now had been rendered speechless, shook himself out of his fugue as Rishe clambered over the railing. \u201cHey!\u201d\nRishe\u2019s moonlight-silver dress flowed around her as she leapt. The lawn was soft, but the fall was still far enough to risk injury.\nWeight evenly distributed on the soles of my feet, roll to transfer the impact to my shins and thighs, then onto my hips and my back.\nShe landed safely, rolled nimbly in her dress, and popped back up. Her hair was covered in leaves. \nI need to hurry up!\nBracing against a nearby rock, she used her weight to snap the heels off of her shoes. There. That would make running a little easier. Satisfied, she slipped them back on and made haste toward the family estate. \n \n***\n \nUp on the balcony, Crown Prince Arnold of Galkhein watched the spectacle play out from beginning to end. He gazed at the girl with the coral hair. Her appearance was that of any young noblewoman, but she moved like a well-trained knight. She\u2019d leapt from the balcony and landed skillfully, showing no signs of distress at her ripped dress or disheveled hair. Instead, she\u2019d knocked the heels off her shoes and dashed away.\nAlso, she had called him an emperor.\nPlaying it all over again in his head, Arnold broke out into a rare chuckle. As his shoulders quivered with laughter, his attendant approached him from behind.\n\u201cThere you are, Your Highness. What are you doing out here? I\u2019m aware you don\u2019t desire a wife, but beginning the search would be wise\u2026 Er, Your Highness?\u201d The attendant\u2019s eyes flew wide. His bored and scowling master was laughing. \u201cDid something happen?\u201d\n\u201cOliver, ready my coach. Wait, no. That will take too much time. Bring me a horse.\u201d\n\u201cAt once, Your Highness. Might I ask why?\u201d\nArnold didn\u2019t respond\u2014he just grinned like a hungry wolf catching scent of his prey.\n \n***\n \nOnce outside the palace gates, Rishe threw herself into the waiting coach, shouting for the driver to make haste. She stopped it a few hundred yards from the manor and bid him farewell. \u201cI\u2019m leaving! Thanks for always being such a safe driver, Daniel!\u201d\nThe road to the manor was muddy from a morning rain shower. She knew from her second life that the coach would get stuck, resulting in a loss of valuable time. It was better to just get out and run. \n\u201cHuff, huff.\u201d Despite her last life\u2019s physical conditioning, this body had no stamina. She\u2019d need to try to get fitter faster this time around.\nRishe reached the end of the road, and her heart promptly sank all the way to her feet. \u201cOh no.\u201d\nThe front door was thronged with people, all of them surrounding a carriage bearing the royal family\u2019s coat of arms.\nI need to get out of here.\nWhile she stood frozen in indecision, one of the knights doing crowd control shouted, \u201cYour Highness! I have eyes on Lady Rishe!\u201d\n\u201cGet out of my way!\u201d A familiar voice started up a bellow. \u201cLet me through! Rishe, how dare you make me wait so long?\u201d\nRishe\u2019s ex-fianc\u00e9, Crown Prince Dietrich, stepped triumphantly forward.\n\u201cI know the thought of hearing your crimes enumerated by the man you love must pain you, but alas, as future king, it is my duty to bring down the hammer of justice upon a villainess such as yourself!\u201d\n\u201cI see I\u2019ve timed it badly,\u201d Rishe muttered. \u201cIn fact, this is my worst loop yet. I\u2019d rather be barred from the house than see you again.\u201d\n\u201cHmm? What are you grumbling about?\u201d Dietrich looked Rishe up and down. \u201cI knew it. You put on a brave face, but I can sense the sorrow in your heart.\u201d\n\u201cI beg your pardon?\u201d\n\u201cYour heart!\u201d the prince repeated. \u201cYour heart! It must be absolutely crushed! Because I called off our engagement!\u201d\nRishe wasn\u2019t sure where he was drawing these conclusions from. Possibly the same place he mined for all his bottomless self-confidence.\n\u201cI can tell you\u2019ve been wandering aimlessly, distraught,\u201d the prince went on. \u201cLook at you. Your dress is caked in mud, your shoes are broken, and there are cuts marring your face and arms. What other possible cause could there be than heartbreak?\u201d\nRishe narrowed her eyes. \u201cDo you ever stop to think about the words coming out of your mouth?\u201d\n\u201cWhat?\u201d\nHis interpretation of events was fanciful to the point of absurdity. \u201cI did not dirty my dress or snap my shoes out of heartbreak. Because I feel none. You\u2019ve always been a little slow, so I\u2019ll make this clear: I do not have a single shred of fondness for you, or for our broken engagement.\u201d\n\u201cWhat?!\u201d the prince said. \u201cWhat are you saying?!\u201d\nThe surrounding crowd began to snicker.\n\u201cIsn\u2019t that the crown prince? Did Lady Rishe just dump him?\u201d\n\u201cWait, but wasn\u2019t he trying to dump her?\u201d\n\u201cCan\u2019t be! Look at her! She doesn\u2019t care at all!\u201d\n\u201cHow dare you nobodies make sport of me?\u201d Dietrich screeched. \u201cI am your prince!\u201d\nTemper aside, Dietrich was a handsome man. He had azure-blue eyes and blond",

Half-stuck in the mud, the man inside it was forced to trudge over the swampy ground, and so the king of Hermity himself arrived, staggering and dirt-stained. \nHe grabbed hold of his son\u2019s collar, pushing him into a low bow. He then turned to Prince Arnold and said, rather loudly, \u201cYour Highness! Allow me to apologize for my son\u2019s foolishness! You are an esteemed guest all the way from Galkhein! It is unthinkable he would not offer you the courtesy you are due!\u201d\n\u201cYou\u2019re hurting me, Father! My back!\u201d\nThe king then turned to Rishe. \u201cMy lady, allow me to sincerely apologize as both a king and a father. My son\u2019s behavior toward you has been utterly disgraceful. I beg you to please give Prince Arnold\u2019s proposal due consideration. Not only for your own sake but for the sake of your country.\u201d\nThe king bowed to her as deeply as his son had to Arnold, and her parents joined him. Rishe felt dizzy at the sight of this abject debasement in the presence of citizens.\nArnold, who had been watching the proceedings with a detached amusement, sobered and stepped toward the king. \u201cYour Majesty, please rise.\u201d\nWithout the smirk, Arnold\u2019s face immediately reverted to its cold mask. The king didn\u2019t move. Maybe something in Arnold\u2019s voice kept him frozen.\n\u201cSuch a trifle won\u2019t cause discord between our kingdoms,\u201d he went on. \u201cHowever, I would beg a little time to speak with Lady Rishe.\u201d\nLater, Rishe would learn that Arnold\u2019s attendant had spoken to the king\u2019s own gentleman, certain that his words would reach their target. \u201cMy master took such trouble to attend these festivities, and this is the welcome he is offered? I wonder, what will the emperor think when he learns of his son\u2019s slighting at your nation\u2019s hands?\u201d\n\u201cIf you would, Lady Rishe?\u201d The plump king looked to be on the verge of tears.\nRishe had no obligation to accept and no desire to spend a moment longer in this country than was absolutely necessary. But acquiescence seemed the fastest way to move things along.\nAs her mind whirled, Arnold leaned in to whisper, \u201cIf you refuse to hear my suit, you won\u2019t deter me. I\u2019ll simply move on to Plan B.\u201d\nAnd that was how she found herself in one of the palace\u2019s parlors, here to \u201cjust talk\u201d to Prince Arnold. The ball guests were all gone. It was just the two of them.\n\u201cI want to know what you\u2019re planning,\u201d Rishe said flatly.\n\u201cPlanning? Me?\u201d\n\u201cBy asking me to marry you. You don\u2019t know me. A proposal like this wouldn\u2019t come out of the blue.\u201d\nThis man was destined to become an aggressive warmonger over the next few years. He wouldn\u2019t do anything without a dozen motives.\nPrince Arnold just smiled. \u201cI have no plans. I\u2019m simply enamored with you.\u201d\n\u201cEnamored\u2026?\u201d\nThat was the last thing she\u2019d expected him to say. Asking him to elaborate didn\u2019t seem worth the breath\u2014he was obviously lying. As if this ruthless, inhuman creature with ice in his veins could feel even a flicker of affection.\n\u201cWhy refuse me?\u201d Arnold asked. \u201cYour engagement is broken, you\u2019re on the verge of exile, and you have no faction or supporters. At this rate, you\u2019ll be dead within a fortnight. I\u2019d call my offer a stroke of unbelievable fortune.\u201d\n\u201cYou\u2019re not wrong,\u201d Rishe admitted. \u201cOnce upon a time, I would have jumped at your offer.\u201d\nIf it had been made in her first life, for instance. But now Rishe knew better. Her life was only just getting started, and the future held endless possibilities. After the horror of her sixth loop, she yearned for freedom.\nI don\u2019t want to marry him. I won\u2019t be anyone\u2019s captive. Still\u2026\nRishe, more than anyone, knew that the slightest adjustment could enact profound changes on the trajectory of a life. No doubt she\u2019d have many more lives, but this could be the only one where marriage to Arnold would be an option.\nThe dread emperor. The tyrant. The man who will stoke the fires of war. \nRishe knew the gossip, the endless conjecture behind Arnold Hein\u2019s bloody reign, but she didn\u2019t know the truth.\nWhy? The question had haunted her since her first life. She\u2019d never before had the chance to even speak to him.\nShe had wondered it as a merchant, hearing of the distant outbreak of war. She\u2019d wondered when the news of the dead and dying reached her apothecary. When she had comforted her terrified mistress in her life as a maid, assuring her everything would be all right. When she squared off against him in battle, as he plunged a sword through her heart\u2014even then she wondered. \nIf I stick around, maybe I\u2019ll finally have my answer. Half of her was dying to know. The other half didn\u2019t give a damn. And yet\u2026\nShe recalled a childhood dream. Rather, a longing.\nRishe let out a breath. \u201cYou claim you are enamored with me.\u201d\n\u201cYes. I am completely under your spell.\u201d\nTo think he could spout such nonsense with a straight face!\n\u201cThen will you grant me anything I desire?\u201d\n\u201cSo long as it is within my power,\u201d Arnold said. \u201cAnything you want will be yours.\u201d\nRishe hesitated, gathering her thoughts. \u201cI have some conditions.\u201d Arnold silently motioned for her to go on. \u201cI want full control over the wedding festivities. Everything must be procured through merchants of my choosing.\u201d\n\u201cFine.\u201d Arnold nodded. \u201cYou\u2019re free to do business with whomever you wish.\u201d\n\u201cAfter we are married, I must be in a position to mingle with guests from abroad.\u201d\n\u201cThat sounds within the purview of the crown princess. Anything else?\u201d\n\u201cI will be allowed to live in a separate residence from your mother and father.\u201d\nShe meant this seriously, but it made Arnold laugh. \u201cYou don\u2019t seem the type to worry about an overbearing mother-in-law.\u201d\n\u201cYou would be surprised. Combative relationships with one\u2019s new family are the most difficult part of marriage, or so they say. It could be a ramshackle cottage for all I care\u2014I just require a secondary residence.\u201d\nActually, Rishe didn\u2019t care at all about in-laws. When Arnold set his war into motion, his first move would be the assassination of his father. A genuine coup by patricide, not at all like Dietrich\u2019s clumsy attempt. Next, he would name himself emperor, take control of the country, and mobilize the military.\nSeparating him from his parents will make the first step more difficult\u2014although not impossible, unfortunately.\n\u201cAnything else?\u201d Arnold asked. \u201cI\u2019ll do whatever it takes to marry you.\u201d\n\u201cIdeally, I\u2019d like to know your endgame,\u201d Rishe said with dignity. \u201cBut as I doubt there\u2019s any chance of that, I have one final request.\u201d She jabbed a finger into his face, regardless of how rude it was. \u201cI will spend my time idling around the castle. No work, no study. I shall be utterly useless.\u201d\nLet\u2019s see just how much you want me as your princess.\nAfter a long moment of silence, Arnold cracked a merry laugh. The proposal remained; all her conditions were met.\n\n(2) chapter number given is likely out of range: 0\nChapter: 7\n\nChapter 2\nChapter 2\n \n\u201cYOU KNOW, it was only after I went into commerce that I truly had a dream for the future,\u201d Rishe had once confided in a friend. \u201cUp until then, I existed only as the crown prince\u2019s fianc\u00e9e or my father\u2019s daughter. My every act was to become more worthy of that status. But now, for the first time, I actually have a goal of my own.\u201d\n\u201cOh, yeah?\u201d her friend said. He was the ruler of the desert kingdom, and his smile was awfully charming. \u201cWhat\u2019s that?\u201d\nRishe smiled back. \u201cI want to travel to every single country in the world. I want to see everything in every town, peruse their markets, and meet",
    "query_text": " the eyes of every person who lives there!\u201d\nBy now, that felt like such a distant dream.\n \n***\n \nRishe awoke with a start, eyes snapping open as she sensed a disturbance in the air.\nShe unsheathed her sword halfway, primed for danger. \nInside the coach, her old enemy sat across from her, one hand outstretched. \u201cWhat do you think you\u2019re doing?\u201d she demanded.\nWhen they\u2019d boarded the coach, Rishe had warned him not to lay a single finger on her throughout the trip to his kingdom. Ordering the prince not to touch his consort was absurd, but Arnold readily agreed. He had, after all, promised to follow her every direction.\nAnd yet, here he was, already breaking his promise.\nArnold appeared unperturbed by her glare. \u201cDon\u2019t look at me like that. I was merely trying to recover what you took from me.\u201d\n"

    "prefix_text": " sharp sting of pain. Nothing compared to her injuries sustained during her life as a knight, though.\nArnold did not share her nonchalance. \u201cWhat do you think you\u2019re doing?!\u201d\nHe grabbed for her arm. She stepped out of his grasp. Was blood truly so shocking? She didn\u2019t have the time to worry about it. Clutching the overfull bowl, Rishe hurried back to the knights.\n\u201cDon\u2019t worry. This isn\u2019t poison,\u201d Rishe said. She demonstrated as much by drizzling it with a spoon over her own fresh wound. It stung. That meant the ingredients were working.\n\u201cThis is crushed liquori grass, luqua flowers, and carilya nuts. I\u2019ll swallow some if that\u2019s what it takes to prove it\u2019s safe.\u201d It was horribly bitter; she hoped it wouldn\u2019t come to that. \u201cThe paralysis will last for days. Please make up your mind quickly.\u201d\n\u201cMake up our mind?\u201d\n\u201cWill you allow me to cure the poison? Or would you rather drag paralyzed soldiers all the way to Galkhein? I suppose you could waste His Highness\u2019s time searching for a hunter\u2019s settlement to use their antidote.\u201d She smiled serenely. \u201cIt makes no difference to us. Right, Your Highness?\u201d\nIn the end, Rishe applied the antidote.\nThe recovery took a few hours. While they waited, Rishe picked herbs in the same meadow she\u2019d been gazing at with yearning from the carriage. A fortuitous turn of events. She found anti-inflammatory herbs and flowers to ease sour bellies, ingredients for curing headaches, and mushrooms for inducing slumber. She wrapped them all up in a handkerchief.\nIn the meantime, Arnold dispatched a messenger to this region\u2019s lord, making arrangements to deliver the apprehended bandits. After coordinating with Oliver, he drifted over to Rishe.\n\u201cI see your interest in flowers is mercenary, rather than ornamental,\u201d he said, surveying the heaps of herbs gathered on the bank of the pond. He sat down beside her.\nWhen he didn\u2019t say anything more, Rishe went back to work plucking leaves from plants with valuable stems. The leaves had no medicinal effects, but they did make a decent broth. Slumber mushroom spores were a nuisance unless dried; they were spread out beside her in the sun.\nI wonder, would he be annoyed if I attached herbs to the roof of the coach? That would be unusual adornment for a crown prince\u2019s retinue, but it wouldn\u2019t hurt to ask.\nShe realized, quite suddenly, that Arnold was looking at her. At her hands, specifically. He sat cross-legged with his chin propped on his fist, staring absently, like a kid watching a column of ants march by.\nWhat is so fascinating about herbs?\nTheir eyes met. \u201cAm I bothering you?\u201d he asked.\nRishe shook her head slowly. \u201cNot at all. I was just curious what caught your eye.\u201d\n\u201cNothing specific. I was just thinking how very unusual you are.\u201d He was smiling again. \u201cI\u2019m looking forward to how you\u2019ll surprise me next.\u201d\nLike I\u2019m some sort of rare pet he bought to entertain him. She didn\u2019t like that. Nothing she\u2019d done was at all remarkable\u2014normal tasks performed by a normal person.\n\u201cI didn\u2019t make that antidote for your amusement.\u201d\n\u201cI realize that.\u201d The instigating smile faded from his lips. \u201cYou know, those knights you coerced into taking your home-brewed medicine were all born in the slums.\u201d\n\u201cCoerced? That\u2019s hardly the word I\u2019d use.\u201d\n\u201cGalkhein claims to value merit above all else, but in the end, people are judged by where they came from. Despite this, those men fought their way up from nothing.\u201d\nRishe paused in plucking the seeds from a flower and looked up at Arnold.\n\u201cThe men with the worst cases of the paralysis were all newly assigned. They\u2019ve spent weeks training to ensure this mission was a success. That older knight\u2014the one who bowed to you\u2014sustained an injury protecting the rookies. He cares deeply about his men.\u201d\n\u201cYou seem to care about them too,\u201d Rishe commented.\n\u201cI handpicked them for my retinue.\u201d Arnold clambered to his feet, only to fall into a bow. \u201cAnd you kept them safe. You have my deepest gratitude.\u201d\nRishe found herself at a loss for words. Was this Arnold putting on a mask to hide the monster within? Or was this the real him? She remembered the way he\u2019d looked when he held his blade to the bandit\u2019s throat, like a child poised to break a toy he had grown bored of.\n\u201cDon\u2019t mention it,\u201d Rishe said, uncomfortable. \u201cI knew how to do it, so I did.\u201d\nArnold laughed softly. \u201cBe that as it may, I\u2019d still count a noblewoman who can brew remedies from wildflowers by the side of the road a rare find.\u201d\n\u201cEarlier, when you grabbed my wrist\u2026\u201d Rishe steered the subject away from her incongruous knowledge. \u201cYou broke your promise. You said you wouldn\u2019t touch me.\u201d\n\u201cThat was reflex,\u201d Arnold protested. \u201cI thought you were going to hurt yourself.\u201d\nSuch a simple conversation, so casual. It had Rishe feeling positively peculiar.\n\u201cWhy are your knights so wary around me?\u201d she asked. \n\u201cWary? Oh, they were all at the palace when you broke your first engagement. They\u2019re most likely concerned I\u2019m bringing home a villainous jilt who will lead to my ruin. Something silly like that.\u201d\n\u201cI see.\u201d Apparently, being dumped by a prince called into question one\u2019s herbalist abilities.\n\u201cI\u2019m glad you mentioned it,\u201d Arnold went on, \u201cbecause there may be people in Galkhein who will oppose our union. I will do everything in my power to protect you, but you must bring any insults or threats to me right away.\u201d\n\u201cAre there likely to be many?\u201d\n\u201cIn theory, the crown prince may choose his own wife, but the done thing is, of course, to marry a princess. I assume a duke\u2019s daughter would have at least some ties to the royal family?\u201d\nHe assumed correctly. She was in the family tree, if a rather distant branch.\n\u201cMy father has ordered me to choose a bride from a different kingdom rather than a woman of my own land because\u2014\u201d\n\u201cOne never knows when a hostage will come in handy,\u201d Rishe finished for him.\nGalkhein was an expansionist empire. Currently, peace reigned\u2014but peace was precarious. If Galkhein demanded any of the countries to hand over a princess bride, then none were in a position to refuse. With his daughter in the hands of a foreign power, no king would dare oppose a war that power cared to wage.\n\u201cI sent a message to my father telling him I happened upon a close relation of Hermity\u2019s king\u2014a duke\u2019s daughter who had been recently tossed aside by her fianc\u00e9e,\u201d Arnold said. \u201cI also may have implied I was the reason for your falling out\u2014yours and the prince\u2019s. Why, when I saw a woman so powerful and connected and beloved, I couldn\u2019t help but plunder you.\u201d\n\u201cPlunder me? That\u2019s certainly one way to describe it.\u201d Dietrich had kicked up an almighty fuss, despite being the one who broke the engagement.\n\u201cMy father approves of you because he sees you as a bargaining chip. There will be others who aren\u2019t prepared to accept you so willingly.\u201d\n\u201cIs that so?\u201d Rishe said steadily.\n\u201cNever fear,\u201d Arnold responded. \u201cThey\u2019ll eat their words, every one of them. They will receive you as their crown princess if they value their\u2014\u201d\n\u201cNo, being a hostage is perfect.\u201d \nArnold stared at her. \u201cHm?\u201d\n\u201cAs a hostage, I\u2019ll have no official duties, will I? We can pretend I\u2019m here only under great duress, and there will be no need for my comment on governmental or diplomatic affairs.\u201d\nArnold hesitated. \u201cI suppose not.\u201d\n\u201cExcellent! Then I can live my dream of being utterly useless.\u201d Rishe trembled with delight. The thought of acting as an ambassador had really been weighing on her mind. Being a princess was nonstop work. Having been groomed for the position from an early age, Rishe knew members of the royal family barely even had time to sleep.\nBut prisoners didn\u2019t have places in government.\n\u201cThis is such a weight off my mind,\u201d Rishe admitted. \u201cThank you so much for keeping your promise, Your Highness.\u201d\n\u201cEr, of course.\u201d\n\u201cBut don\u2019t worry, I won\u2019t shirk my duties as wedding planner.\u201d Nearly ready to collapse with relief, Rishe returned to her herbs.\n \n***\n \nAfter the bandit incident, Rishe felt the knights begin to ease a bit in her presence.\nDespite their initial reluctance to accept her help, they continued to report the injured men\u2019s progress and bring any concerns directly to her. In return, they took over gathering herbs from the surrounding countryside on their rest stops.\nShe hadn\u2019t done it for gratitude, but she was nonetheless touched. Gathering medicinal herbs had been second nature ever since her life as an apothecary, and it was foolish to ever turn down loyalty.\nSeveral days after the altercation with the bandits, the coach train finally arrived in the imperial capital of Galkhein.\n\u201cOh my,\u201d Rishe murmured as they passed through the gates.\nWhite stone buildings stood in straight rows, lining clean, orderly streets. The first stories all appeared to be shops, while the second-floor windows were festooned with flowers. Everywhere she looked were smiling",
    "query_text": " faces, citizens turned out to witness their prince\u2019s return over the smooth brick roads. Overlooking it all was the towering magnificence of the imperial palace.\n\u201cThe capital is the seat of power in Galkhein,\u201d Arnold explained. \u201cSeveral key trade routes converge here.\u201d\nRishe nodded, suddenly anxious to be out of the coach. More and more people were gathering to watch their progress, some carrying shopping bags in both arms or holding hands with children. Many of them waved, as if greeting someone dear to them.\nHappy citizens and clean, orderly streets meant wealth. Galkhein was well-off. Rishe couldn\u2019t help but grin at an adorable little girl watching them roll by with sparkling eyes. When she saw Rishe\u2019s smile, she blushed and leapt up in the air, laughing with delight.\nThe coach made its way through the city before passing through"

    "prefix_text": "he returned to the detached wing with her fresh water. She put clean sheets on the bed the knights had installed, satisfied that she had a comfortable place to sleep. This room also had the highest-up balcony in the whole detached palace.\nTaking a break, she wandered out onto the balcony and looked off over the capital, the golden afternoon tinged with the onset of twilight. The day was fresh with a recent rain, the air clear enough to see for miles. The spring breeze felt good against her skin, sweaty from cleaning. Rishe leaned against the railing, leaning her head back and closing her eyes.\nShe felt like collapsing into bed immediately, but she desperately needed a wash. Still, she didn\u2019t want to pull herself away from the view and the breeze just yet. When she resumed gazing out absentmindedly, something her mother once said drifted back to her. \n\u201cRishe, there is no need for you to think for yourself.\u201d\nShe frowned, the memories coming thick and fast now.\n\u201cYou mustn\u2019t forget that the duty of our family is to live our lives fully devoted to the kings of the land. You\u2019re smart, but all the thinking in the world won\u2019t do a woman any good. You need only concern yourself with how best to serve the crown prince.\u201d\n\u201cStudies? Focus on social etiquette\u2014that\u2019s what you need for navigating high society. The crown prince\u2019s bride must be flawless. Your smile is lacking. You must always strive to appear amiable.\u201d\nRishe breathed out a long sigh. When I was fifteen, their lectures were the only thing I thought about.\nHer parents preached constantly. \u201cA woman\u2019s true happiness is to marry a suitable man and give birth to his heirs.\u201d\n\u201cBut, Mother\u2026\u201d\nObjection was not permitted. Any argument was immediately dispensed with. As a woman, Rishe could not inherit her father\u2019s title. Her only value was in her marriage. \nDespite knowing now that the opinions of others were as worthless as empty titles, the words still echoed in her memories.\nRishe\u2019s fingertips twitched, and she opened her eyes. Unmoving, she said, \u201cShouldn\u2019t you be seeing to your duties?\u201d\n\u201cMore hidden depths, I see,\u201d came a voice tinged with pleasure. Rishe straightened and turned. There was Arnold, leaning against the door to the balcony. \u201cYou seem able to sense my approach no matter how far or how hard I try.\u201d\n\u201cYou\u2019re quite naughty, aren\u2019t you? You\u2019ve been making your presence known little by little, emanating threat, to see how quickly I catch on.\u201d\n\u201cSo you noticed that as well.\u201d Arnold joined Rishe on the balcony. She tensed, but all he did was cast a curious glance at the view. \u201cWhat were you looking at?\u201d\n\u201cThe city.\u201d Rishe was hardly going to tell him she\u2019d been looking at nothing, merely ruminating on her mother\u2019s overbearing advice. The view from the balcony was spectacular, though. \u201cWhat\u2019s that over there?\u201d\n\u201cYou mean the library? The state invested funds to expand it. We have books from all over the world.\u201d\n\u201cReally? You have a library that big?\u201d Rishe\u2019s eyes sparkled with delight. She pointed out another building. \u201cWhat about that spire? It\u2019s beautiful.\u201d\n\u201cThe church and clock tower. The bells ring out the hour.\u201d\n\u201cOoh, how wonderful! And it looks like there\u2019s a rather big market there too?\u201d\n\u201cYes, the largest market in the city. Carts line up in the early morning. Most of the offerings are made fresh every day.\u201d\n\u201cAmazing! And what about that pretty mountain over there?\u201d\nRishe tried and failed to contain her excitement. She couldn\u2019t help but imagine what seeing all these places up close would be like. The grand library, the beautiful church that told the time, and the morning market with fresh, delicious food\u2014she wanted to experience it all.\nSeeing Arnold\u2019s bemused face, she said, \u201cWhat?\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m just wondering where all this interest is coming from,\u201d he said. \u201cYou were so reluctant to come, yet here you are, brimming with curiosity for my city.\u201d\n\u201cWell\u2026\u201d she trailed off, unsure of how to respond.\nWhat should I say? Should I just tell him the truth?\nThis wasn\u2019t a secret, but talking about her hopes and dreams to the man who had killed her was a little awkward. A strange self-consciousness settled on her, her cheeks heating as she mumbled, \u201cBecause I\u2019ve always wanted to.\u201d\nArnold looked at her keenly. \u201cWanted to what?\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019ve always wanted to come here.\u201d\nDuring her life as a merchant, Rishe developed her single dream to visit everywhere in the world. That dream was cut tragically short when only one country remained: Galkhein.\nIn each of her consecutive lives, Rishe\u2019s priority became staying alive. Every time, without fail, just as she found her footing, the world was plunged into chaos. She never had the chance to see Galkhein. This betrothal was her chance. \u201cIt\u2019s probably why I agreed to marry you,\u201d she added after a moment\u2019s hesitation.\nArnold swept a tepid glance over the city. \u201cThere\u2019s nothing here worth seeing.\u201d\n\u201cThat\u2019s not true! The places you just told me about sound amazing! Your citizens are clean and happy, your knights are proper and kind. Oh, and another\u2014\u201d \nRishe broke off enumerating Galkhein\u2019s charms as Arnold turned to look at her. His face was impassively calm, but something seemed to pass by underneath, like a shadow in deep water.\n\u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d Rishe said. \u201cDid I say something odd?\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m just amazed you could be so unaware of yourself.\u201d \nWh-what a rude thing to\u2014\n\u201cI\u2019ve never met anyone like you. No one has ever spoken to me the way you do. I don\u2019t know any girls of your class with the knowledge or the physical abilities you possess. Noblewomen don\u2019t concern themselves with such things.\u201d\nRishe, there is no need for you to think for yourself.\nShe frowned. \u201cPerhaps you\u2019re right, but everything I\u2019ve learned is precious to me. No one can take my skills away\u2014I value them with my life. Some may say that my knowledge is worthless, but it makes no difference to me.\u201d She turned from the balcony, fixing him with a piercing gaze. \u201cI\u2019m the one who decides what I value.\u201d\nRishe had clawed free of her mother and father\u2019s indoctrination a long time ago. Man, woman\u2014it didn\u2019t matter. She could do anything. Being queen was not the culmination of her life; she wouldn\u2019t trade her freedom for anything.\nArnold matched her intensity. \u201cYou\u2019re right.\u201d He gently cupped her cheek in a one hand, swiping his thumb along the line of her jaw, smearing dust. \u201cLive your life here however you wish. I vow to do my utmost to protect you.\u201d\n\u201cHuh?\u201d\nHis vehemence took her by surprise. Arnold had every right to demand she act the part of a proper consort. This was a political marriage; Rishe was essentially a hostage, after all. Yet here he was, cosigning her misbehavior. Moreover, he was all but swearing to defend her from the consequences.\n\u201cWhy?\u201d\n\u201cYou know why. I\u2019m enamored with you.\u201d Arnold fed her the same line. \u201cI know you said you don\u2019t care about other people\u2019s approval, but I like your asymmetrical talents. I don\u2019t find them useless at all.\u201d \nRishe didn\u2019t know how to respond.\n\u201cI thought I\u2019d already made that clear.\u201d He took his hand back, drawing away, stopping just on the threshold. He turned back to a stunned Rishe and said, \u201cLet me know if there\u2019s anything you desire. I realize I just broke our agreement\u2014the one about not touching you.\u201d\nAnd with that, he was gone.\nShaken, Rishe sank to the floor of the balcony. I can\u2019t predict him at all! Just what is Arnold Hein planning?\nThe quiet of evening fell over the imperial capital of Galkhein.\n \n***\n \n\u201cMmm.\u201d\nSunshine streamed through the window as Rishe roused from sleep. She rolled over, basking in the morning light. The wall she expected wasn\u2019t there, and the bed seemed larger than usual. Taking advantage of it, she stretched out as far as she could.\nWas this her chamber at home? Or maybe she was a merchant again, spending a night at the desert king\u2019s palace. Perhaps this was her bed of straw from her life as a maid? Her memories met and interwove as she drifted into wakefulness.\nWhen Rishe finally opened her eyes, she grew even more confused.\nLight blue curtains surrounded the bed, thin enough to allow sunlight to pass through. She pulled them aside to find herself in a bare room devoid of furniture and carpet.\nOh, right. She didn\u2019t need to report for morning training, tend to her herb garden, prepare breakfast, or see how the bottles she had brewed overnight were coming along.\nRealizing that, Rishe buried her face in the pillow. \u201cSo soft,\u201d she murmured. \nJudging by the position of the sun, it was about six o\u2019clock in the morning. She was pretty sure she had gone to bed around midnight last night.\nI slept for six whole hours? Rishe couldn\u2019t believe it. Generally, she was used to getting about four hours of sleep. On bad days, at the height of an emergency as a knight or apothecary, she wouldn\u2019t even get that much. \nI\u2019ve got nothing but cleaning on the schedule today. Hostages can sleep in, right? At least a little? Excitement suffused her at the thought, but that was interrupted by a knock on the door.\n\u201cLady Rishe, are you awake? It\u2019s Oliver\u2014Prince Arnold\u2019s attendant.\u201d\nRishe sat up with a start. \u201cI\u2019m awake!\u201d\nOliver continued",
    "query_text": " to speak through the door. \u201cI apologize for bothering you at such an early hour. I\u2019m here with a delivery.\u201d\n\u201cJust a moment!\u201d Rishe slipped out of the bed, dressed quickly, and tugged the bed\u2019s canopy closed. She opened the door to find Oliver standing in the hallway with a polite smile.\nHe apologized again. \u201cThis was the only time I could slip away from His Highness\u2019s office. I\u2019m glad to see that you\u2019re already dressed.\u201d\n\u201cNot at all.\u201d Rishe paused, stepping back to allow him inside. \u201cOh my. You look exhausted.\u201d\nOliver grimaced. \u201cIs it that obvious? We\u2019ve been climbing through mountains of paperwork, but never mind me"

Everything you said was tailor-made to stoke their jealousy. You\u2019ve gained me enemies, so thanks for that.\u201d\nArnold snorted. \u201cEverything I said was to protect you from enemies. They need to know you aren\u2019t just some trophy they can eliminate without recourse. We need to show them this to forestall any potential moves against you in the future.\n\u201cShow them what, exactly?\u201d\n\u201cThat I\u2019ll protect you no matter what.\u201d\nHe said it with such nonchalance that it brought her up short. Protect me? Arnold Hein, protect me?\nSuch an ironic position to take. She couldn\u2019t tell him that, of course. Her response came out somewhat strangled. \u201cI doubt they\u2019ll be anything to worry about. In fact, the biggest threat facing me is you.\u201d\n\u201cOh? And why do you say that?\u201d\n\u201cFor many reasons, the most obvious being that I\u2019m no match for you with a blade.\u201d As much as it pained her to admit it.\nArnold looked pleased. \u201cPerhaps we should duel.\u201d\n\u201cYes, please! And if it wouldn\u2019t be an intrusion\u2014I would like to train with you.\u201d If she studied him, she could learn his strategies and his attack patterns. She\u2019d never be a match in speed or raw power, but any insight would be invaluable.\n\u201cSure.\u201d Arnold shrugged. \u201cI don\u2019t mind.\u201d\n\u201cTruly?\u201d Her eyes glittered with anticipation.\nHe chuckled. \u201cYour answers never disappoint me.\u201d\n\u201cWhat\u2019s that supposed to mean? Oh, it looks like they\u2019re playing a new song.\u201d\nA soft melody drifted across the hall. The crowd divided, heading toward the center of the floor or against the wall. The next dance was starting, and everyone was waiting to see what the crown prince and his new fianc\u00e9e would do.\n\u201cWe don\u2019t have to dance if you don\u2019t want to,\u201d Arnold said.\n\u201cOh? As it happens, I like dancing.\u201d Plus, she couldn\u2019t resist a blatant challenge. She offered him her hand.\n\u201cVery well, then.\u201d Arnold only hesitated for a moment before taking it and steering her gently to an empty spot on the floor. He didn\u2019t seem like the dancing type, but his movements were slick and effortless. Facing one another, they joined hands. Arnold wrapped his other arm around her waist. \nOoh. His hand felt huge against her back. She realized she was breathing a little faster. They\u2019d never been this close before.\nNo, that isn\u2019t quite true. This is the second time. Rishe\u2019s final memories from her last life flashed vividly through her mind.\nThis was indeed the second time they had been this close\u2014the first had ended with a sword through her chest.\nEmperor Arnold Hein had single-handedly decimated the knights in the castle. Rishe stood in the midst of the carnage, breath ragged as she gripped the hilt of her sword, slick with her own blood. She was the last line of defense. The chamber behind her housed the royal family.\nIf they could reach the hidden passageways, the young prince and his party could find shelter with their allies across the border. Rishe and the other knights were prepared to sacrifice their lives to allow the royal family to survive. Their escape meant victory.\nBells tolled out, urging flight. All is lost. Run. Rishe managed to graze Arnold\u2019s cheek with her blade before she looked down to find his jet-black sword blooming out of her chest.\nShe remembered how it burned, as if the blade was made of fire. It was heat, not pain, but her breathing grew labored, and when Emperor Arnold Hein withdrew his sword, Rishe crumpled. \nHe knelt by her side and whispered something.\nThe words were seared into her memory. Rishe squeezed Arnold\u2019s hand as they danced.\nI\u2019ll be the bully this time. \nRishe shifted her weight back, slipping out of the hold on her waist. She broke Arnold\u2019s lead and spun, drifting on the harmony of the dance. She took him by surprise; his eyes went wide.\nI wonder what you\u2019ll do when you\u2019re no longer on top, Your Highness. Her smile was a declaration of war. Watching him attempt to follow her lead would be delightful. She pulled his hand toward her, attempting to move them into a spin.\nBut Arnold held fast. He planted his hand on her waist and turned them in a different direction, using her inertia against her. Hey! As a result, Rishe twirled by herself on the spot.\nShe didn\u2019t miss a step. She turned elegantly, the hem of her dress whispering across the ballroom floor. She heard appreciative murmurs from the wallflowers lined up watching.\nDespite that, Rishe took it as a defeat. Round one to Arnold. \nSo\u2026you can think on your feet. How about this?\nArnold remained unruffled, evading her next scheme like it was nothing. He grinned down at her, his eyes shining with a dare.\nHe thinks I can\u2019t beat him. His ease vexed her, but it was his smugness that made her angry.\nShe let out a hard breath, attempting a maneuver to lure him in while turning. He leaned back, not falling for it at all.\nHe\u2019s just too good at changing his center of gravity! She kept her astonishment under wraps, but she felt it. Despite how close we\u2019re dancing, I can\u2019t throw off his timing at all. He\u2019s sidestepped all my attempts, and he takes back the lead the second I let down my guard!\nIt made her increasingly angry. She twirled and stepped as the dance dictated, all the while feeling out for moments of weakness. Arnold played along with her game, completely unruffled.\nEvery single time. I\u2019m doing my utmost to trip him up, but he doesn\u2019t even seem annoyed! At this point she\u2019d just settle for any reaction at all.\nTheir unusual dance style had gathered a crowd. Rishe paid them no mind, focused only on her goal. Then something occurred to her, and her breath caught in her throat.\nWait a minute, he has left an opening. It\u2019s the same one from before. She thought back to their fight to the death, to that moment when she had managed to draw blood. That may indeed have been his only weakness.\nIf I strike the same way\u2014huh? Before she could try, Arnold appeared to lose patience, wrapping his arm around her waist. He bent her back into a dip so deep it felt like he\u2019d pulled a carpet from under her feet. She yelped, grabbing at him reflexively, clinging tight. His big hands gripped her securely enough to mitigate the sensation of falling. Relief flooded through her, and she felt a laugh rumble against her ear.\nThe music came to an end with one last ringing note. She blinked. The dance is over?\nA hush fell over the ballroom. Then cheers broke out, followed by a round of applause.\n\u201cThat was incredible!\u201d\nThe watching nobles crowded in.\n\u201cYou two moved in such perfect harmony!\u201d\n\u201cI was on the edge of my seat. I felt like I was watching a sword duel!\u201d\n\u201cIs this a dance from Hermity? I\u2019ve never seen such steps before.\u201d\n\u201cUh, well\u2026\u201d Rishe floundered. She glanced up at Arnold, who appeared to be enjoying her struggle. She\u2019d get no help from him.\nRishe dealt with the barrage of questions as best she could, letting the crowd sweep them into the dining room, which was set up for a buffet-style meal. She made sure to greet every guest, riveting their faces into her memory.\nShe must have been acting peculiar, because Arnold eventually said, \u201cRishe, I think the wine is getting to you. Shall we get some fresh air?\u201d\nRishe hadn\u2019t touched a single drop. In fact, she\u2019d been caught up in so many conversations that she hadn\u2019t even had the chance to eat, but she had experience working on an empty stomach. She accepted Arnold\u2019s encouragement as the escape it was.\nJust when I least expect it, he\u2019ll act the gentleman. Maybe he\u2019d remembered her demand for a carefree life of doing nothing.\nRishe cast a charming look across the crowd. \u201cThank you for your consideration, Your Highness. Forgive me.\u201d She gave a polite bow before quietly slipping away. \nShe didn\u2019t head straight to the balcony but rather slowly walked around the hall. There was only so much she could find out glued to Arnold\u2019s side all night.\nI need information. Galkhein\u2019s political landscape was a mystery to me through all my past lives. I only know the rumors that made it abroad.\nAlthough she knew of Arnold\u2019s eventual patricide, she had no concept of the circumstances leading up to it. She needed a better picture of the factions and power balance inside the court. The lives these people led.\nI know better than to believe wartime gossip. This Arnold Hein is a lot different from what I\u2019d heard he was like at nineteen. He\u2019s not as diabolical as the rumors led me to believe. He likes to push, but he isn\u2019t unkind. The thought drifted across her mind, leaving her conflicted. Well, he\u2019s not unkind now. But I still don\u2019t like not knowing his motives. And he\u2019s a bit of a jerk, to be honest. \nShe tried to settle her mind and just observe. Gathering intelligence was necessary to lead a long, carefree life lazing around the palace.\nIf I recall correctly, that\u2019s Lord Hannawald. He seems to be on good terms with Count Gayle. Duke Hudemann and Duke Teinitz are having a friendly enough conversation, yet they don\u2019t seem close. Rishe ticked off the names of people she\u2019d met, committing them to memory.\nA wave of sweet perfume wafted over her. A pretty girl with soft blonde hair had appeared at her side. \u201cHow do you do, Lady Rishe? I\u2019m Cornelia Thea Toona.\u201d\nDuke Toona\u2019s family was the thirty-first house she\u2019d met tonight.\nRishe smiled graciously. \u201cRishe Irmgard Weitzner. A pleasure to meet you.\u201d\n\u201cThe pleasure is all mine.\u201d Cornelia smiled sweetly. Her eyes were big and bright, her lips full. She held a glass in each hand and offered one to Rishe. \u201cWine? I see you\u2019re empty-handed.\u201d\nA gaggle of other ladies nearby began giggling among themselves.\n\u201cHow dare she act so haughty when she\u2019s a captive. It\u2019s time for her learn just what she is. A pawn to be played and discarded.\u201d\n\u201cShe should enjoy her time on Prince Arnold\u2019s arm while she can.\u201d\n\u201cShe is from a minor nation, after all.\u201d\nAs Rishe took note of their whispers, Cornelia gazed at her with doe eyes. \u201cDoes my offering offend you in some way?\u201d\nIf I remember correctly, House Toona holds a vast territory in southern Galkhein.\nRishe held out a hand to accept the glass. \u201cHow could it? Thank you, Lady Cornelia.\u201d\nBefore Rishe could touch the glass, Cornelia gave a dramatic shout. \u201cOh dear! My hand slipped!\u201d She dropped it, quite obviously on purpose. Without thinking, Rishe grabbed her skirts and leaned back, plucking the glass out of the air with the other hand.\nCornelia let out a cry of surprise as Rishe caught the wine before any could spill. She swirled the glass and brought it to her nose to breathe in the bouquet.\nHmm\u2026 That\u2019s mashed capsicum. Where did she even get that? What a waste of perfectly good wine. And why bother spicing it enough to singe the tongue if she just planned to ruin my dress? Pick a plan, my dear.\nHiding her exasperation, Rishe smiled brightly. \u201cI\u2019ve never had a wine quite like this. What an unusual scent.\u201d\nCornelia bit her lip in frustration. Rishe beamed at her. You\u2019ve got such a pretty face, Lady Toona. Why don\u2019t you smile?\nRishe leaned in close to Cornelia. \u201cThis vintage isn\u2019t available where I\u2019m from. I\u2019m ever so anxious to learn more. Should I perhaps invite Prince Arnold over to enjoy a glass? Which tray did you get this from?\u201d\n\u201cWhat? Oh, um\u2026\u201d Rishe had a policy of never backing down from a fight, but it seemed Cornelia didn\u2019t share it. \u201cS-sorry, but I don\u2019t remember. Such a large hall, you see.\u201d\n\u201cA shame. I\u2019ll just give His Highness this one, then. I\u2019ll be sure to let him know who it\u2019s from.\u201d\n\u201cUh, wait!\u201d Cornelia rapidly shook her head. \u201cI-I got that glass for you, so I think you should\u2014you know what? Never mind! Maybe I should just take that\u2014oh no!\u201d\nRishe ignored the ashen-faced Cornelia, raising the glass and swallowing down a gulp. \n\u201cI-I can\u2019t believe\u2026\u201d\n\u201cSuch a spicy flavor, just as I imagined.\u201d Rishe smiled again to the assembled group\u2019s astonishment. \u201cWhat a warm welcome. I do hope the two of us can spend more time together. Perhaps\u2026a tea party?\u201d\n\u201cTh-the two of us?\u201d Cornelia stammered.\n\u201cYes. I want to know all about House Toona.\u201d\nCornelia looked flabbergasted, but she recovered herself and nodded.\nThat should do. One of Rishe\u2019s eventual plans required a plot of land in a temperate climate. House Toona\u2019s would likely be perfect, but she needed to confirm a few things with Cornelia. Never back down from a fight. Even further\u2026\nShe recalled the words of her mentor from her days as a merchant.\nDon\u2019t bother with fights you can\u2019t win.\nThe other ladies fled, fearful of this strange girl who gulped down painfully spicy wine like it was nothing. \n \n***\n \nRishe retreated to the empty balcony to enjoy the music, grimacing with every stinging mouthful of wine. She drank it in decreasing sips until Arnold joined her.\n\u201cWhat are you making that face for?\u201d\nRishe swirled the glass. \u201cDon\u2019t worry, it\u2019s not you. It\u2019s just this wine is so spicy.\u201d\n\u201cSpicy? The wine is?\u201d\n\u201cMm. It\u2019s seasoned with capsicum. I barely managed to get that first mouthful down without gagging.\u201d\nArnold swiped the glass from her hand. \u201cDon\u2019t tell me this was a poisoning attempt!\u201d\nRishe clicked her tongue in annoyance at her own lack of vigilance. No one else would be able to grab something from her so easily.\nArnold glared at the wine. \u201cYou don\u2019t need to drink this. I\u2019ll get rid of it.\u201d\n\u201cHey, give that back! They ruined a perfectly good glass of wine because of me. I\u2019m not going to waste it.\u201d She grabbed it back and took another sip, shuddering at the taste.\nArnold glowered. \u201cTell me who did this. I\u2019ll have them executed.\u201d\n\u201cDon\u2019t be ridiculous. You don\u2019t kill people like her\u2014you use them.\u201d Just the tiniest bit of wine to go, but it was getting harder to make herself drink it. She gave the glass a reproachful look, then glanced back at Arnold. \u201cOh, and I owe you an apology.\u201d\n\u201cDo you?\u201d\n\u201cI used your name to defend myself.\u201d The girls had only backed off when she threatened to tattle to Arnold. Rishe found that sort of thing inelegant in the extreme, and she was embarrassed.\nArnold sighed at Rishe\u2019s apologetic bow. \u201cThere\u2019s nothing wrong with a wife invoking her husband\u2019s name.\u201d\nRishe hesitated. \u201cWe\u2019re not married yet.\u201d\n\u201cThat\u2019s a formality. It\u2019s as good as done, if you ask me.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2026see.\u201d\nHe took her distraction as an opportunity to swipe her glass back. Instead of dumping it out, Arnold gulped the rest of it down. \n\u201cDamn, that packs a punch,\u201d he grumbled.\n\u201cI told you that!\u201d Rishe snapped. \u201cAre you all right? Let me get you some water!\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m fine. But now you\u2019ve fulfilled your obligation to the wine, haven\u2019t you?\u201d\nRishe didn\u2019t know what to say. He\u2019d helped her\u2014not by taking charge but by following her lead. Without cutting her down and telling her she was",
    "query_text": " being foolish. Without rolling his eyes and dismissing her desires as trifles.\n\u201cThank you,\u201d Rishe said stiffly, which just made him laugh.\n\u201cWhat were you thinking about when we were dancing?\u201d he asked.\n\u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d\n\u201cYou were thinking about someone else, weren\u2019t you? Who?\u201d\nRishe didn\u2019t know a delicate way to say I was thinking about a future version of you I met in another life.\n\u201cHmm?\u201d His tone was oddly light, teasing even. But the gleam in his hunter\u2019s eyes said she wouldn\u2019t get away so easily.\nObviously, Rishe couldn\u2019t give him an honest answer. \u201cI wasn\u2019t thinking about anyone else. I was worried"

    "prefix_text": ". Among them was Elsie, the girl Rishe stood up for the other day. Rishe pulled her hands out of the soapy water, gently rinsed them, and said, \u201cLet me help. What still needs to be done?\u201d\n\u201cYou again?\u201d Diana rounded on Rishe. \u201cI don\u2019t know who you serve, but I\u2019m amazed you have the time to do other people\u2019s work. I wish I had so much free time.\u201d\nHuffily, she turned from Rishe. \u201cLet\u2019s just ignore these useless fools. Laura, Maya. Come on. If we want to be chosen as Lady Rishe\u2019s maids, we mustn\u2019t waste our time.\u201d\nDiana took out a slip of paper from her pocket, smoothing it out. \u201cIt looks like the new bedsheets for her palace will arrive today. We should inspect them to make sure everything is perfect!\u201d\n\u201cWait up, Diana!\u201d\nThe two maids followed Diana out. Rishe waited for the door to close before turning to Elsie and the others. \u201cLet\u2019s keep working. If there\u2019s anything too large and cumbersome, feel free to pass it over to me.\u201d\n\u201cTh-thank you so much!\u201d The new maids went weak with gratitude. One of them, a girl on the verge of tears, even fell into a full bow. Rishe muttered encouragement as she scrubbed some bedsheets.\nElsie, who was washing the sheets with her, wore a rueful look. \u201cI\u2019m so sorry for the trouble. We\u2019re just not learning fast enough.\u201d\n\u201cYou haven\u2019t been working here long, have you? It takes time to learn a new job, no matter who you are,\u201d Rishe said as she kept scrubbing. \u201cAnd it\u2019s not like you\u2019ve never washed a single thing in your life before, right?\u201d\nElsie nodded nervously. \nRishe had realized over the past few days doing the laundry that not all the newcomers were complete amateurs. They\u2019d obviously done chores at home, or something similar. When set a specific task, they could perform it properly, but Diana\u2019s complaints weren\u2019t unfounded. They did take far too much time with laundry.\nBut it\u2019s obvious why. \u201cDo you know anything about Diana?\u201d Rishe asked Elsie. \u201cLike, is she from a well-off family?\u201d\nElsie said, \u201cI heard that her father was a business owner. She worked with him.\u201d\n\u201cI heard that as well,\u201d added another maid. \u201cBut he fell into debt and had to sell off.\u201d \nRishe stopped scrubbing for a moment to consider this.\n\u201cUm, is something the matter?\u201d Elsie asked.\nRishe smiled and shook her head. \u201cNo, nothing. Let\u2019s just focus on getting these washed for the time being.\u201d\n \n***\n \nThat afternoon, thirty maids were assembled in the detached wing of the palace. Ten of them were old hands, long in service to the royal family, while the other twenty were freshly hired. The crown princess was to choose her maids from among these thirty. They wore their nerves plainly on their sleeves. \n\u201cHey, I thought this palace was in a terrible state of neglect,\u201d one maid whispered. \u201cWhy is it so sparkling clean?\u201d\n\u201cYeah, you\u2019re right,\u201d said another. \u201cSomeone must have sorted it out before we arrived.\u201d\n\u201cI wonder what kind of person Lady Rishe is. Ooh, I\u2019m so nervous.\u201d\nThe girls looked around anxiously.\n\u201cHey, Elsie, that girl who was always helping us isn\u2019t here.\u201d\nElsie blinked. \u201cYou\u2019re right.\u201d\n\u201cLook, Diana. That impertinent newbie didn\u2019t get picked.\u201d \nAt her friend\u2019s observation, Diana preened with satisfaction. \u201cNo surprise there. You need some manners to attend to Lady Rishe. I bet she got kicked out of the running!\u201d Her eyes sparkled with confidence.\nAt last, there was a knock at the door.\n\u201cHer Royal Highness, Princess Rishe.\u201d\nThe maids quickly fell into bows. Diana\u2019s chest ached with anticipation as heels clicked on the floor, approaching the line of girls. From the corner of their eyes, the maids saw a wide-skirted court dress. A gentle scent washed over them.\nWithout even looking at her, they could tell Crown Princess Rishe was a lovely woman. Diana and her friends swelled with pride that she was to become their mistress.\nBut then Laura whispered to Diana, \u201cHey, isn\u2019t this scent familiar?\u201d\n\u201cQuiet!\u201d Clearly it was some sort of expensive perfume. Or so Diana thought, but then she realized what it was. The words just slipped out. \u201cIt\u2019s soap.\u201d\n\u201cHuh? Did you just say something?\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s soap. The same kind we always use.\u201d Diana was sure of it.\nThe princess said, \u201cPlease rise.\u201d \nWhy did her voice sound so familiar? An incredible foreboding gripping her, Diana looked up. She gasped.\n\u201cMy name is Rishe Irmgard Weitzner.\u201d\nBefore her stood the beautiful newcomer\u2014the thorn in her side for the past few days. The smile she wore was peaceful and just the slightest bit satisfied.\n \n***\n \nI\u2019m so glad I managed to finish washing the sheets in time!\nStanding before the maids with Arnold\u2019s attendant Oliver at her side, Rishe was panicking on the inside. She\u2019d had so much to do this morning that she\u2019d put off the laundry to the last minute. She took deep, controlled breaths, praying no one would notice that she\u2019d raced here at a dead sprint.\nOliver was none the wiser as he spoke to the assembled girls. Rishe took the opportunity to look them over. She locked eyes with Elsie, who was gaping at her. It was a nice change\u2014usually her face was as blank as a rock wall.\nI\u2019m sorry for the deception. I figured blending in would give me the best picture of your working conditions.\nThe new maids wore similarly shocked expressions, while others watched her with delight. Meanwhile, the veterans, including Diana, had all gone pale. They trembled, stunned into silence. One seemed locked in a terrifying trance, while another looked on the verge of tears. All of them had spoken",

As the ringleader, Diana was covering her mouth with both hands, like she was holding in a scream.\nOliver had finished his introduction. \u201cYour Highness, if you would?\u201d\nRishe stepped forward. \u201cFirst, I must apologize to you for what has transpired prior to this meeting. My deception, that is"

They were long in shape and impossibly blue, but they possessed a blade-sharp intensity. His gaze was clear, beautiful, and cold as ice. His eyelashes cast shadows on his striking face. He was a work of art.\nCurrently, this work of art was staring her down with a look that could kill.\nHe laughed. \u201cYou barreled right into me. For a moment, I thought I\u2019d been attacked by a wild boar.\u201d\nIt was an exceedingly rude thing to say to a stranger, but as luck would have it, this man was not a stranger. At least not to Rishe.\n\u201cWhat are you even doing here?\u201d the man went on. \u201cThe party is in the\u2014\u201d\nRishe interrupted him with a wordless shout of dismay. The man drew back, reflexively reaching for his sword. He composed himself with visible difficulty. \u201cWho are you? You look like any noblewoman, but your manner is\u2026\u201d \n\u201cEmperor Arnold Hein!\u201d \nThe man\u2019s eyes widened. He didn\u2019t mistake her surging contempt. Rishe had crossed swords with this man. Recently. He was the one responsible for ending her sixth life. \nHe must be a guest at the banquet. It makes sense.\nArnold Hein was the scion of a military nation not far from Rishe\u2019s home country of Hermity, the one in which they now stood. Their kingdoms, so recently at war, had brokered an ostensible peace, and the two ruling families met from time to time. Crown Prince Dietrich\u2019s engagement party would be one such occasion. He\u2019d gathered elites from far and wide to introduce to his beloved Mary.\nThe man eyed Rishe with rising curiosity. \u201cYou know me? This is my first time in Hermity.\u201d\nUh-oh. Rishe pasted on a smile as her mind spun in circles. This man was dangerous. She had to avoid entanglements with him at all costs. Five years from now, Arnold Hein would invade Hermity. \nHe was an extraordinarily skilled swordsman and, with a powerful military at his back, was destined to conquer kingdom after kingdom. He had done as much in her second, third, fourth, and fifth lives. In her sixth, Rishe had faced him in battle herself and died by his hand.\nWe never had a chance. That war was lost before it began.\nArnold\u2019s brilliance lay not in his swordplay but in his skill as a tactician. He set countries up for conquest and knocked them down, swallowing them one by one.\nI know him, but he doesn\u2019t know me. We haven\u2019t met in this life. I need an excuse fast. \nRishe curtsied slowly. \u201cMy name is Rishe Irmgard Weitzner. We\u2019ve never been introduced, but I\u2019ve heard of you.\u201d\nArnold donned an amused smile. \u201cYou plant your weight like a trained swordswoman. Your center of gravity is perfect.\u201d\n\u201cYou exaggerate,\u201d Rishe demurred. \u201cThat was simply a curtsy to an esteemed guest.\u201d \n\u201cI must have misheard, but I swear you called me \u2018emperor\u2019 just now.\u201d \nRishe froze.\n\u201cMy father yet lives,\u201d Arnold said. \u201cI am simply a crown prince. Why would you call me that?\u201d \n\u201cUh, um\u2026\u201d Rishe floundered for an answer.\nShe\u2019d made such a foolish mistake. Arnold\u2019s gaze cut right through her. It felt like he\u2019d see through any lie she told right down to her soul. She remembered this from the battlefield\u2014how his attention alone felt like a sword thrust.\nBut why even bother to lie? They\u2019d never meet again, so who cared what he thought of her? Sure, she harbored a hard feeling or two over the recent slaying, but there was no point complaining about it to this Arnold. Calling him the emperor was boorish, but Rishe was in the process of being forcibly exiled. Why play at diplomacy?\nShe took a deep breath and bowed low. This was not the curtsy of a noble lady but of a servant bowing in supplication to her master.\n\u201cMy humblest apologies, Your Highness. I was in a rush. Such a rude slip of the tongue.\u201d She raised her head. \u201cMy ex-fianc\u00e9 just annulled our engagement, so I\u2019ve got a lot on my mind. If you would excuse me.\u201d \n\u201cHe annulled your engagement?\u201d\nAt that, Rishe turned and fled.\nThis unexpected run-in with Arnold had taken up valuable time. She threw open the door to the balcony and hiked up her skirts, kicking off her shoes in anticipation of jumping into a tree. Looking down, she realized the ground was far closer than she\u2019d feared.\nExcellent! I can just drop into the garden!\nArnold, who up until now had been rendered speechless, shook himself out of his fugue as Rishe clambered over the railing. \u201cHey!\u201d\nRishe\u2019s moonlight-silver dress flowed around her as she leapt. The lawn was soft, but the fall was still far enough to risk injury.\nWeight evenly distributed on the soles of my feet, roll to transfer the impact to my shins and thighs, then onto my hips and my back.\nShe landed safely, rolled nimbly in her dress, and popped back up. Her hair was covered in leaves. \nI need to hurry up!\nBracing against a nearby rock, she used her weight to snap the heels off of her shoes. There. That would make running a little easier. Satisfied, she slipped them back on and made haste toward the family estate. \n \n***\n \nUp on the balcony, Crown Prince Arnold of Galkhein watched the spectacle play out from beginning to end. He gazed at the girl with the coral hair. Her appearance was that of any young noblewoman, but she moved like a well-trained knight. She\u2019d leapt from the balcony and landed skillfully, showing no signs of distress at her ripped dress or disheveled hair. Instead, she\u2019d knocked the heels off her shoes and dashed away.\nAlso, she had called him an emperor.\nPlaying it all over again in his head, Arnold broke out into a rare chuckle. As his shoulders quivered with laughter, his attendant approached him from behind.\n\u201cThere you are, Your Highness. What are you doing out here? I\u2019m aware you don\u2019t desire a wife, but beginning the search would be wise\u2026 Er, Your Highness?\u201d The attendant\u2019s eyes flew wide. His bored and scowling master was laughing. \u201cDid something happen?\u201d\n\u201cOliver, ready my coach. Wait, no. That will take too much time. Bring me a horse.\u201d\n\u201cAt once, Your Highness. Might I ask why?\u201d\nArnold didn\u2019t respond\u2014he just grinned like a hungry wolf catching scent of his prey.\n \n***\n \nOnce outside the palace gates, Rishe threw herself into the waiting coach, shouting for the driver to make haste. She stopped it a few hundred yards from the manor and bid him farewell. \u201cI\u2019m leaving! Thanks for always being such a safe driver, Daniel!\u201d\nThe road to the manor was muddy from a morning rain shower. She knew from her second life that the coach would get stuck, resulting in a loss of valuable time. It was better to just get out and run. \n\u201cHuff, huff.\u201d Despite her last life\u2019s physical conditioning, this body had no stamina. She\u2019d need to try to get fitter faster this time around.\nRishe reached the end of the road, and her heart promptly sank all the way to her feet. \u201cOh no.\u201d\nThe front door was thronged with people, all of them surrounding a carriage bearing the royal family\u2019s coat of arms.\nI need to get out of here.\nWhile she stood frozen in indecision, one of the knights doing crowd control shouted, \u201cYour Highness! I have eyes on Lady Rishe!\u201d\n\u201cGet out of my way!\u201d A familiar voice started up a bellow. \u201cLet me through! Rishe, how dare you make me wait so long?\u201d\nRishe\u2019s ex-fianc\u00e9, Crown Prince Dietrich, stepped triumphantly forward.\n\u201cI know the thought of hearing your crimes enumerated by the man you love must pain you, but alas, as future king, it is my duty to bring down the hammer of justice upon a villainess such as yourself!\u201d\n\u201cI see I\u2019ve timed it badly,\u201d Rishe muttered. \u201cIn fact, this is my worst loop yet. I\u2019d rather be barred from the house than see you again.\u201d\n\u201cHmm? What are you grumbling about?\u201d Dietrich looked Rishe up and down. \u201cI knew it. You put on a brave face, but I can sense the sorrow in your heart.\u201d\n\u201cI beg your pardon?\u201d\n\u201cYour heart!\u201d the prince repeated. \u201cYour heart! It must be absolutely crushed! Because I called off our engagement!\u201d\nRishe wasn\u2019t sure where he was drawing these conclusions from. Possibly the same place he mined for all his bottomless self-confidence.\n\u201cI can tell you\u2019ve been wandering aimlessly, distraught,\u201d the prince went on. \u201cLook at you. Your dress is caked in mud, your shoes are broken, and there are cuts marring your face and arms. What other possible cause could there be than heartbreak?\u201d\nRishe narrowed her eyes. \u201cDo you ever stop to think about the words coming out of your mouth?\u201d\n\u201cWhat?\u201d\nHis interpretation of events was fanciful to the point of absurdity. \u201cI did not dirty my dress or snap my shoes out of heartbreak. Because I feel none. You\u2019ve always been a little slow, so I\u2019ll make this clear: I do not have a single shred of fondness for you, or for our broken engagement.\u201d\n\u201cWhat?!\u201d the prince said. \u201cWhat are you saying?!\u201d\nThe surrounding crowd began to snicker.\n\u201cIsn\u2019t that the crown prince? Did Lady Rishe just dump him?\u201d\n\u201cWait, but wasn\u2019t he trying to dump her?\u201d\n\u201cCan\u2019t be! Look at her! She doesn\u2019t care at all!\u201d\n\u201cHow dare you nobodies make sport of me?\u201d Dietrich screeched. \u201cI am your prince!\u201d\nTemper aside, Dietrich was a handsome man. He had azure-blue eyes and blond hair\u2014a prince straight out of a picture book. His looks and place in the succession meant a never-ending swarm of women vying for his affections. He was brought up a pampered princeling, never wanting for anything. It manifested in a pompous manner and an overconfidence in his own abilities. Rishe had cautioned him about his attitude before, but he never paid her any mind.\nI\u2019m so glad I don\u2019t have to marry him.\nShe wished she could go back and tell the shocked, scared girl from her first life not to worry about her shattered engagement. Still, she might as well say it all here and now, with the assembled knights and citizens to bear witness.\n\u201cYour Highness, you exist to love and protect your people. It\u2019s unbecoming to speak of them in this manner.\u201d\n\u201cYou\u2019re the unbecoming one!\u201d the prince snapped. \u201cBeg me for forgiveness!\u201d\n\u201cI won\u2019t. Calling off our betrothal is the best course, and I applaud Your Highness for your good sense.\u201d\nNow even the knights were trembling with suppressed mirth. \nDietrich was turning red. \u201cD-don\u2019t laugh at me!\u201d\n\u201cLady Rishe,\u201d came a sweet voice. \u201cAren\u2019t you ashamed of yourself?\u201d \nRishe fought down a groan.\nOut of the crowd stepped a charming, dainty girl. Her big eyes moist with tears, she took her place at Dietrich\u2019s side. \u201cI do not allow the people I care about to be treated so very ill!\u201d \n\u201cWhy, Lady Mary. You\u2019re here.\u201d Rishe sighed. \u201cHow nice.\u201d\nThe young Mary scowled through her tears. Hidden behind her skirts, Dietrich continued to shout his disapproval. \u201cRishe! You\u2019ve brought my beloved Mary to tears! She\u2019s told me everything. How you bullied her, ridiculed her. How you find it amusing to lock her in the classroom overnight! Such a wicked woman could never be queen!\u201d\nNone of that\u2019s true.\nRishe glanced at Mary, who averted her gaze a little awkwardly.\n\u201cMore importantly,\u201d Rishe said, \u201chave you already brought your concerns to my parents, Your Highness?\u201d\n\u201cMore importantly?! I did, if you must know! Your parents are furious. They have vowed to disown you.\u201d\n\u201cAh. Then I\u2019m too late.\u201d Her parents held their reputation above all else. Rishe had little hope of retrieving any of her money or belongings now.\n\u201cWhy are you acting so strangely?\u201d Dietrich sniffed. \u201cAh, I understand. You\u2019re in such shock from this turn of events that\u2014\u201d\n\u201cListen, Dietrich.\u201d In her exasperation, Rishe dropped his title. \u201cI accept your decree. We are no longer engaged. I shall never darken your doorstep again. So\u2026relax a little.\u201d\n\u201cHuh? What are you saying?\u201d\n\u201cSince I was a child, I believed that my only value was in our betrothal. Being engaged to the crown prince was my whole reason for living. I was wrong about that. Only I determine my value\u2014no one else. That\u2019s why I don\u2019t care about this. I\u2019m beyond it.\u201d Rishe made sure to look him directly in the eye as she spoke. \u201cYou are an unnecessary element in my life.\u201d\nDietrich staggered back. His legs seemed to go out from under him, and he crumpled. At that, the knights finally let go of their composure, laughing along with the courtiers.\n\u201cSt-stop!\u201d the prince wailed. \u201cYou are my subjects. This\u2026this shows such flagrant disrespect!\u201d\n\u201cDietrich, don\u2019t pay them any mind,\u201d Lady Mary said. \u201cLady Rishe, is this cruelty necessary?\u201d\n\u201cPerhaps this is a blessing in disguise.\u201d Rishe\u2019s attention moved to Mary, making the girl\u2019s slender shoulders jump. She had no reason to worry; Rishe didn\u2019t bite. \u201cI\u2019ve been wanting the opportunity to speak to you, Lady Mary. You\u2019re strong. I admire you very much.\u201d\n\u201cWhat are you talking about?\u201d\n\u201cYou\u2019re a lovely girl who never fails to smile despite your troubles. You don\u2019t put up walls around your heart, and you do your utmost to put others at ease. Even now, you bravely stand before me to protect the prince.\u201d\nMary\u2019s eyes were wide with confusion. Rishe picked her words carefully, attempting to diminish the girl\u2019s guilty feelings, if only a little. \u201cYou need to marry the prince for your family\u2019s sake, right?\u201d\n\u201cHow do you\u2014?\u201d\nRishe had learned this truth in one of her past lives. Mary was born to a poor family, and she had studied like mad to be accepted into the academy to hunt for a husband. She intended to make sure neither she nor her brothers ever went hungry again.\nShe went on, \u201cRemember this: you are the one in control of your life. Don\u2019t sell it to anyone else. Can you trust a man who so easily discards the woman he\u2019s been engaged to since childhood? Do you truly believe he cares for you?\u201d\nAstonishment bloomed across Mary\u2019s face. She looked over at Dietrich, who hadn\u2019t",
    "query_text": " bothered to stand up. The truth was\u2026within a year, Prince Dietrich would be in prison, his title stripped from him. He would plan a mad coup d\u2019\u00e9tat against the king, attempting to provoke the citizens to war. His plan would be discovered in its early stages, rendering him a laughingstock across the kingdom.\n\u201cYou must shape your future with your own hands\u2014you mustn\u2019t entrust your desires to others.\u201d \n\u201cMy\u2026my desires?\n"

    "prefix_text": " him, it didn\u2019t become any less disarming. Long eyelashes, arched brows, a noble nose. His bright blue eyes reminded her of the drift ice she\u2019d seen in a northern kingdom, gazing out from a ship in one of her past lives. She knew she was dwelling on this to buy time, even as the reality before her sank in.\n\u201c\u2026to become my wife.\u201d\nShe froze, unable to process the words. \u201cWhat?\u201d Rishe glanced around, desperately searching the faces of the crowd. They all seemed as stunned as she felt. She looked down at Arnold again. \u201cYour wife?\u201d \n\u201cYes, that\u2019s right.\u201d\n\u201cYou want me to become your wife?\u201d\n\u201cYes.\u201d\nRishe couldn\u2019t speak. This was truly happening. It was real. It clicked into place in her head, and she let out a strangled grunt.\nWhat is going on? Why is this happening?\nShock lapped at her, fuzzing at the corners of her vision. He wanted to marry her. Arnold wanted to marry Rishe. Her murderer wanted to marry her.\nWhy is he doing this? He must have some ulterior motive, a broader goal. But I have to give him an answer.\nThe onlookers were holding their breath as Rishe said flatly, \u201cI reject your proposal.\u201d\nArnold said nothing.\nShe had to reject him. She was going to live a long, peaceful, carefree life, damn it, and no one would stop her. And yet\u2026\nArnold began to laugh, and the deep, creeping sense of dread inside Rishe only grew. Why does he seem so amused by this?!\n \n***\n \nHer previous life was her sixth. Disguised as a man, Rishe rose as a warrior of an island country she came upon in her travels. It was a conventional yet charming kingdom formed of red brick. After striking up a friendship with a group of knights who didn\u2019t realize she was a woman, Rishe followed their advice and joined them.\nThe training was grueling enough to make her wish she were dead. Back when she had lived as a noble, she\u2019d learned how to wield a sword for basic self-defense, but training as a noble lady had in no way prepared her for this. She drilled relentlessly, barely taking the time to sleep. Just as she became a full-fledged knight, Emperor Arnold\u2019s forces lay siege to the castle.\n \n***\n \nHow could this happen? \nIn her seventh life, Rishe wearily sank into her chair. Across from her sat Arnold, his legs crossed and chin propped up on his hand, watching her lazily.\n\u201cWhat\u2019s the matter?\u201d he asked. \u201cYou seem unhappy.\u201d\n\u201cYou could say that.\u201d Even her voice was grumpy. Still, she couldn\u2019t very well tell him it was because she bore a grudge from a previous life. After the first time her life rewound to that pivotal moment, she\u2019d resolved to keep her loops a secret. \u201cI had plans for my exile. A brand-new life. And now because of you, my parents are involved. Even the king has heard about it!\u201d\nAfter Rishe rejected Arnold, Dietrich had immediately cried out, \u201cTh-the crown prince of Galkhein proposed to Rishe?!\u201d\nHis shrieks were loud enough to attract the attention of the master and mistress of the manor.\nWhen her parents came out, Rishe had protested, \u201cI\u2019m not going to marry him! I\u2019m leaving the country just as Dietrich commanded.\u201d\nNo one listened. Their faces just paled with nervous confusion.\nJust then, a glittering coach arrived. Half-stuck in the mud, the man inside it was forced to trudge over the swampy ground, and so the king of Hermity himself arrived, staggering and dirt-stained. \nHe grabbed hold of his son\u2019s collar, pushing him into a low bow. He then turned to Prince Arnold and said, rather loudly, \u201cYour Highness! Allow me to apologize for my son\u2019s foolishness! You are an esteemed guest all the way from Galkhein! It is unthinkable he would not offer you the courtesy you are due!\u201d\n\u201cYou\u2019re hurting me, Father! My back!\u201d\nThe king then turned to Rishe. \u201cMy lady, allow me to sincerely apologize as both a king and a father. My son\u2019s behavior toward you has been utterly disgraceful. I beg you to please give Prince Arnold\u2019s proposal due consideration. Not only for your own sake but for the sake of your country.\u201d\nThe king bowed to her as deeply as his son had to Arnold, and her parents joined him. Rishe felt dizzy at the sight of this abject debasement in the presence of citizens.\nArnold, who had been watching the proceedings with a detached amusement, sobered and stepped toward the king. \u201cYour Majesty, please rise.\u201d\nWithout the smirk, Arnold\u2019s face immediately reverted to its cold mask. The king didn\u2019t move. Maybe something in Arnold\u2019s voice kept him frozen.\n\u201cSuch a trifle won\u2019t cause discord between our kingdoms,\u201d he went on. \u201cHowever, I would beg a little time to speak with Lady Rishe.\u201d\nLater, Rishe would learn that Arnold\u2019s attendant had spoken to the king\u2019s own gentleman, certain that his words would reach their target. \u201cMy master took such trouble to attend these festivities, and this is the welcome he is offered? I wonder, what will the emperor think when he learns of his son\u2019s slighting at your nation\u2019s hands?\u201d\n\u201cIf you would, Lady Rishe?\u201d The plump king looked to be on the verge of tears.\nRishe had no obligation to accept and no desire to spend a moment longer in this country than was absolutely necessary. But acquiescence seemed the fastest way to move things along.\nAs her mind whirled, Arnold leaned in to whisper, \u201cIf you refuse to hear my suit, you won\u2019t deter me. I\u2019ll simply move on to Plan B.\u201d\nAnd that was how she found herself in one of the palace\u2019s parlors, here to \u201cjust talk\u201d to Prince Arnold. The ball guests were all gone. It was just the two of them.\n\u201cI want to know what you\u2019re planning,\u201d Rishe said flatly.\n\u201cPlanning? Me?\u201d\n\u201cBy asking me to marry you. You don\u2019t know me. A proposal like this wouldn\u2019t come out of the blue.\u201d\nThis man was destined to become an aggressive warmonger over the next few years. He wouldn\u2019t do anything without a dozen motives.\nPrince Arnold just smiled. \u201cI have no plans. I\u2019m simply enamored with you.\u201d\n\u201cEnamored\u2026?\u201d\nThat was the last thing she\u2019d expected him to say. Asking him to elaborate didn\u2019t seem worth the breath\u2014he was obviously lying. As if this ruthless, inhuman creature with ice in his veins could feel even a flicker of affection.\n\u201cWhy refuse me?\u201d Arnold asked. \u201cYour engagement is broken, you\u2019re on the verge of exile, and you have no faction or supporters. At this rate, you\u2019ll be dead within a fortnight. I\u2019d call my offer a stroke of unbelievable fortune.\u201d\n\u201cYou\u2019re not wrong,\u201d Rishe admitted. \u201cOnce upon a time, I would have jumped at your offer.\u201d\nIf it had been made in her first life, for instance. But now Rishe knew better. Her life was only just getting started, and the future held endless possibilities. After the horror of her sixth loop, she yearned for freedom.\nI don\u2019t want to marry him. I won\u2019t be anyone\u2019s captive. Still\u2026\nRishe, more than anyone, knew that the slightest adjustment could enact profound changes on the trajectory of a life. No doubt she\u2019d have many more lives, but this could be the only one where marriage to Arnold would be an option.\nThe dread emperor. The tyrant. The man who will stoke the fires of war. \nRishe knew the gossip, the endless conjecture behind Arnold Hein\u2019s bloody reign, but she didn\u2019t know the truth.\nWhy? The question had haunted her since her first life. She\u2019d never before had the chance to even speak to him.\nShe had wondered it as a merchant, hearing of the distant outbreak of war. She\u2019d wondered when the news of the dead and dying reached her apothecary. When she had comforted her terrified mistress in her life as a maid, assuring her everything would be all right. When she squared off against him in battle, as he plunged a sword through her heart\u2014even then she wondered. \nIf I stick around, maybe I\u2019ll finally have my answer. Half of her was dying to know. The other half didn\u2019t give a damn. And yet\u2026\nShe recalled a childhood dream. Rather, a longing.\nRishe let out a breath. \u201cYou claim you are enamored with me.\u201d\n\u201cYes. I am completely under your spell.\u201d\nTo think he could spout such nonsense with a straight face!\n\u201cThen will you grant me anything I desire?\u201d\n\u201cSo long as it is within my power,\u201d Arnold said. \u201cAnything you want will be yours.\u201d\nRishe hesitated, gathering her thoughts. \u201cI have some conditions.\u201d Arnold silently motioned for her to go on. \u201cI want full control over the wedding festivities. Everything must be procured through merchants of my choosing.\u201d\n\u201cFine.\u201d Arnold nodded. \u201cYou\u2019re free to do business with whomever you wish.\u201d\n\u201cAfter we are married, I must be in a position to mingle with guests from abroad.\u201d\n\u201cThat sounds within the purview of the crown princess. Anything else?\u201d\n\u201cI will be allowed to live in a separate residence from your mother and father.\u201d\nShe meant this seriously, but it made Arnold laugh. \u201cYou don\u2019t seem the type to worry about an overbearing mother-in-law.\u201d\n\u201cYou would be surprised. Combative relationships with one\u2019s new family are the most difficult part of marriage, or so they say. It could be a ramshackle cottage for all I care\u2014I just require a secondary residence.\u201d\nActually, Rishe didn\u2019t care at all about in-laws. When Arnold set his war into motion, his first move would be the assassination of his father. A genuine coup by patricide, not at all like Dietrich\u2019s clumsy attempt. Next, he would name himself emperor, take control of the country, and mobilize the military.\nSeparating him from his parents will make the first step more difficult\u2014although not impossible, unfortunately.\n\u201cAnything else?\u201d Arnold asked. \u201cI\u2019ll do whatever it takes to marry you.\u201d\n\u201cIdeally, I\u2019d like to know your endgame,\u201d Rishe said with dignity. \u201cBut as I doubt there\u2019s any chance of that, I have one final request.\u201d She jabbed a finger into his face, regardless of how rude it was. \u201cI will spend my time idling around the castle. No work, no study. I shall be utterly useless.\u201d\nLet\u2019s see just how much you want me as your princess.\nAfter a long moment of silence, Arnold cracked a merry laugh. The proposal remained; all her conditions were met.\n\n(2) chapter number given is likely out of range: 0\nChapter: 7\n\nChapter 2\nChapter 2\n \n\u201cYOU KNOW, it was only after I went into commerce that I truly had a dream for the future,\u201d Rishe had once confided in a friend. \u201cUp until then, I existed only as the crown prince\u2019s fianc\u00e9e or my father\u2019s daughter. My every act was to become more worthy of that status. But now, for the first time, I actually have a goal of my own.\u201d\n\u201cOh, yeah?\u201d her friend said. He was the ruler of the desert kingdom, and his smile was awfully charming. \u201cWhat\u2019s that?\u201d\nRishe smiled back. \u201cI want to travel to every single country in the world. I want to see everything in every town, peruse their markets, and meet the eyes of every person who lives there!\u201d\nBy now, that felt like such a distant dream.\n \n***\n \nRishe awoke with a start, eyes snapping open as she sensed a disturbance in the air.\nShe unsheathed her sword halfway, primed for danger. \nInside the coach, her old enemy sat across from her, one hand outstretched. \u201cWhat do you think you\u2019re doing?\u201d she demanded.\nWhen they\u2019d boarded the coach, Rishe had warned him not to lay a single finger on her throughout the trip to his kingdom. Ordering the prince not to touch his consort was absurd, but Arnold readily agreed. He had, after all, promised to follow her every direction.\nAnd yet, here he was, already breaking his promise.\nArnold appeared unperturbed by her glare. \u201cDon\u2019t look at me like that. I was merely trying to recover what you took from me.\u201d\nConfused, Rishe looked at the sword in her hand. It had a black lacquered scabbard with a simple golden decoration. Engraved on the hilt was the Galkhein crest.\n\u201cOh!\u201d Rishe thrust the sword back at Arnold. \u201cMy apologies.\u201d\nArnold chuckled. \u201cYou caught me off guard. You were nodding off, and then you suddenly snatched up my sword. You looked quite content snuggling up with it.\u201d\nArnold propped the sword beside him. Rishe pressed a hand to her chest to quell her racing heart. The sword that gutted me in my previous life is now my bed",
    "query_text": "mate. What a world. Her recent stint as a knight had left her ill at ease without a blade at hand. She just couldn\u2019t believe it was Arnold\u2019s she\u2019d reached for.\n\u201cI didn\u2019t mean to disturb you, but I doubted sleeping with a weapon would be comfortable. I\u2019m impressed you sensed my intent before I even touched you.\u201d Arnold rested one elbow against the window frame, watching her with shameless fascination. \u201cOne only develops instincts like that from combat training. And you were also a member of the court? How in the world did you find the time?\u201d\nRishe shrugged. She couldn\u2019t just say"

    "prefix_text": "\u201cLeave her. She may do as she pleases.\u201d\n\u201cShe\u2019s well trained,\u201d Oliver mused. \u201cBut a battlefield is no place for a young lady. She probably wasn\u2019t prepared for such a dreadful spectacle.\u201d\nRishe ignored the murmurs and focused on her work. There they are. I\u2019ll take these, these, and\u2026\n\u201cThe poison must be a sleeping drug,\u201d she overheard Arnold saying. \u201cHunters use such drugs to weaken larger prey. I doubt this dose is lethal.\u201d\n\u201cBut it certainly is annoying,\u201d replied Oliver. \u201cWe\u2019re still two days out from Galkhein. Lugging a company of sleeping men in armor won\u2019t be pleasant.\u201d\n\u201cWe\u2019ll have to stop somewhere nearby. A hunter\u2019s settlement. Perhaps they will have an antidote\u2014\u201d\n\u201cExcuse me.\u201d Rishe, who\u2019d returned from the carriage, raised a hand. \u201cI have an antidote.\u201d\n\u201cWhat?\u201d\nThe entire company stared at her in awe.\n \n***\n \nAs it turned out, Arnold\u2019s guess was right. \nThis sweet-smelling substance was a hunter\u2019s drug, made from ingredients that were only toxic in their raw form. Heat rendered them harmless. Rishe had encountered this poison several times before, curing a customer afflicted with it during her life as an apothecary.\n\u201cA lethal dose for a grown man would fill a wine glass. They likely got less than a hundredth of that,\u201d Rishe explained to Arnold, not looking up from her work. \u201cStill, the numbness can block their airways with the roots of their tongues. It\u2019s best to lay them on their sides.\u201d\n\u201cYes, I understand the theory and the solution.\u201d Arnold gazed down at Rishe\u2019s hands. \u201cThe part I\u2019m struggling with is why you\u2019re the one telling me this.\u201d\n\u201cWell, I know how to make the antidote,\u201d Rishe said patiently as she muddled the herbs together in the white soup bowl she\u2019d borrowed for her flowers. She crushed them with the back of a spoon before adding another dried flower, crushing that as well, and combining them to form a paste. This process would be easier with a pestle, but she wasn\u2019t about to complain. \u201cThis poison is common\u2014it\u2019s cheap and easy to make, which often means the antidote is simple as well.\u201d\nThe antidote was synthesized, in fact, when hunters witnessed a deer showing no symptoms after eating a certain mushroom. They tested those along with other common herbs the deer ate. Rishe mentally thanked them for their scientific rigor as she added a bit of water, straining it all through a cloth.\nRishe stood up, brandishing the bowl of bright green medicine. \u201cBoiling would make the antidote more potent, but this works in a pinch.\u201d\nThat was when she noticed the astonished stares. Unsure of what social faux paus she\u2019d perpetrated, she looked away. Oliver was completely stunned. Arnold looked thoughtful. It was imperative the knights were treated as soon as possible, but to Rishe\u2019s dismay, no one was moving. \nDo they not trust me? That makes sense. Anyone would be reluctant to use medicine concocted by a complete stranger. But the longer we wait, the harder the poison will become to cure. \nShe needed to dispel their doubts. Rolling up her sleeve, Rishe approached Arnold and drew his sword from its scabbard. \u201cI need to borrow this for a moment, Your Highness.\u201d\n\u201cWhat are you\u2014\u201d\nShe pushed the blade against the soft skin of her inner arm. Blood welled up, along with the sharp sting of pain. Nothing compared to her injuries sustained during her life as a knight, though.\nArnold did not share her nonchalance. \u201cWhat do you think you\u2019re doing?!\u201d\nHe grabbed for her arm. She stepped out of his grasp. Was blood truly so shocking? She didn\u2019t have the time to worry about it. Clutching the overfull bowl, Rishe hurried back to the knights.\n\u201cDon\u2019t worry. This isn\u2019t poison,\u201d Rishe said. She demonstrated as much by drizzling it with a spoon over her own fresh wound. It stung. That meant the ingredients were working.\n\u201cThis is crushed liquori grass, luqua flowers, and carilya nuts. I\u2019ll swallow some if that\u2019s what it takes to prove it\u2019s safe.\u201d It was horribly bitter; she hoped it wouldn\u2019t come to that. \u201cThe paralysis will last for days. Please make up your mind quickly.\u201d\n\u201cMake up our mind?\u201d\n\u201cWill you allow me to cure the poison? Or would you rather drag paralyzed soldiers all the way to Galkhein? I suppose you could waste His Highness\u2019s time searching for a hunter\u2019s settlement to use their antidote.\u201d She smiled serenely. \u201cIt makes no difference to us. Right, Your Highness?\u201d\nIn the end, Rishe applied the antidote.\nThe recovery took a few hours. While they waited, Rishe picked herbs in the same meadow she\u2019d been gazing at with yearning from the carriage. A fortuitous turn of events. She found anti-inflammatory herbs and flowers to ease sour bellies, ingredients for curing headaches, and mushrooms for inducing slumber. She wrapped them all up in a handkerchief.\nIn the meantime, Arnold dispatched a messenger to this region\u2019s lord, making arrangements to deliver the apprehended bandits. After coordinating with Oliver, he drifted over to Rishe.\n\u201cI see your interest in flowers is mercenary, rather than ornamental,\u201d he said, surveying the heaps of herbs gathered on the bank of the pond. He sat down beside her.\nWhen he didn\u2019t say anything more, Rishe went back to work plucking leaves from plants with valuable stems. The leaves had no medicinal effects, but they did make a decent broth. Slumber mushroom spores were a nuisance unless dried; they were spread out beside her in the sun.\nI wonder, would he be annoyed if I attached herbs to the roof of the coach? That would be unusual adornment for a crown prince\u2019s retinue, but it wouldn\u2019t hurt to ask.\nShe realized, quite suddenly, that Arnold was looking at her. At her hands, specifically. He sat cross-legged with his chin propped on his fist, staring absently, like a kid watching a column of ants march by.\nWhat is so fascinating about herbs?\nTheir eyes met. \u201cAm I bothering you?\u201d he asked.\nRishe shook her head slowly. \u201cNot at all. I was just curious what caught your eye.\u201d\n\u201cNothing specific. I was just thinking how very unusual you are.\u201d He was smiling again. \u201cI\u2019m looking forward to how you\u2019ll surprise me next.\u201d\nLike I\u2019m some sort of rare pet he bought to entertain him. She didn\u2019t like that. Nothing she\u2019d done was at all remarkable\u2014normal tasks performed by a normal person.\n\u201cI didn\u2019t make that antidote for your amusement.\u201d\n\u201cI realize that.\u201d The instigating smile faded from his lips. \u201cYou know, those knights you coerced into taking your home-brewed medicine were all born in the slums.\u201d\n\u201cCoerced? That\u2019s hardly the word I\u2019d use.\u201d\n\u201cGalkhein claims to value merit above all else, but in the end, people are judged by where they came from. Despite this, those men fought their way up from nothing.\u201d\nRishe paused in plucking the seeds from a flower and looked up at Arnold.\n\u201cThe men with the worst cases of the paralysis were all newly assigned. They\u2019ve spent weeks training to ensure this mission was a success. That older knight\u2014the one who bowed to you\u2014sustained an injury protecting the rookies. He cares deeply about his men.\u201d\n\u201cYou seem to care about them too,\u201d Rishe commented.\n\u201cI handpicked them for my retinue.\u201d Arnold clambered to his feet, only to fall into a bow. \u201cAnd you kept them safe. You have my deepest gratitude.\u201d\nRishe found herself at a loss for words. Was this Arnold putting on a mask to hide the monster within? Or was this the real him? She remembered the way he\u2019d looked when he held his blade to the bandit\u2019s throat, like a child poised to break a toy he had grown bored of.\n\u201cDon\u2019t mention it,\u201d Rishe said, uncomfortable. \u201cI knew how to do it, so I did.\u201d\nArnold laughed softly. \u201cBe that as it may, I\u2019d still count a noblewoman who can brew remedies from wildflowers by the side of the road a rare find.\u201d\n\u201cEarlier, when you grabbed my wrist\u2026\u201d Rishe steered the subject away from her incongruous knowledge. \u201cYou broke your promise. You said you wouldn\u2019t touch me.\u201d\n\u201cThat was reflex,\u201d Arnold protested. \u201cI thought you were going to hurt yourself.\u201d\nSuch a simple conversation, so casual. It had Rishe feeling positively peculiar.\n\u201cWhy are your knights so wary around me?\u201d she asked. \n\u201cWary? Oh, they were all at the palace when you broke your first engagement. They\u2019re most likely concerned I\u2019m bringing home a villainous jilt who will lead to my ruin. Something silly like that.\u201d\n\u201cI see.\u201d Apparently, being dumped by a prince called into question one\u2019s herbalist abilities.\n\u201cI\u2019m glad you mentioned it,\u201d Arnold went on, \u201cbecause there may be people in Galkhein who will oppose our union. I will do everything in my power to protect you, but you must bring any insults or threats to me right away.\u201d\n\u201cAre there likely to be many?\u201d\n\u201cIn theory, the crown prince may choose his own wife, but the done thing is, of course, to marry a princess. I assume a duke\u2019s daughter would have at least some ties to the royal family?\u201d\nHe assumed correctly. She was in the family tree, if a rather distant branch.\n\u201cMy father has ordered me to choose a bride from a different kingdom rather than a woman of my own land because\u2014\u201d\n\u201cOne never knows when a hostage will come in handy,\u201d Rishe finished for him.\nGalkhein was an expansionist empire. Currently, peace reigned\u2014but peace was precarious. If Galkhein demanded any of the countries to hand over a princess bride, then none were in a position to refuse. With his daughter in the hands of a foreign power, no king would dare oppose a war that power cared to wage.\n\u201cI sent a message to my father telling him I happened upon a close relation of Hermity\u2019s king\u2014a duke\u2019s daughter who had been recently tossed aside by her fianc\u00e9e,\u201d Arnold said. \u201cI also may have implied I was the reason for your falling out\u2014yours and the prince\u2019s. Why, when I saw a woman so powerful and connected and beloved, I couldn\u2019t help but plunder you.\u201d\n\u201cPlunder me? That\u2019s certainly one way to describe it.\u201d Dietrich had kicked up an almighty fuss, despite being the one who broke the engagement.\n\u201cMy father approves of you because he sees you as a bargaining chip. There will be others who aren\u2019t prepared to accept you so willingly.\u201d\n\u201cIs that so?\u201d Rishe said steadily.\n\u201cNever fear,\u201d Arnold responded. \u201cThey\u2019ll eat their words, every one of them. They will receive you as their crown princess if they value their\u2014\u201d\n\u201cNo, being a hostage is perfect.\u201d \nArnold stared at her. \u201cHm?\u201d\n\u201cAs a hostage, I\u2019ll have no official duties, will I? We can pretend I\u2019m here only under great duress, and there will be no need for my comment on governmental or diplomatic affairs.\u201d\nArnold hesitated. \u201cI suppose not.\u201d\n\u201cExcellent! Then I can live my dream of being utterly useless.\u201d Rishe trembled with delight. The thought of acting as an ambassador had really been weighing on her mind. Being a princess was nonstop work. Having been groomed for the position from an early age, Rishe knew members of the royal family barely even had time to sleep.\nBut prisoners didn\u2019t have places in government.\n\u201cThis is such a weight off my mind,\u201d Rishe admitted. \u201cThank you so much for keeping your promise, Your Highness.\u201d\n\u201cEr, of course.\u201d\n\u201cBut don\u2019t worry, I won\u2019t shirk my duties as wedding planner.\u201d Nearly ready to collapse with relief, Rishe returned to her herbs.\n \n***\n \nAfter the bandit incident, Rishe felt the knights begin to ease a bit in her presence.\nDespite their initial reluctance to accept her help, they continued to report the injured men\u2019s progress and bring any concerns directly to her. In return, they took over gathering herbs from the surrounding countryside on their rest stops.\nShe hadn\u2019t done it for gratitude, but she was nonetheless touched. Gathering medicinal herbs had been second nature ever since her life as an apothecary, and it was foolish to ever turn down loyalty.\nSeveral days after the altercation with the bandits, the coach train finally arrived in the imperial capital of Galkhein.\n\u201cOh my,\u201d Rishe murmured as they passed through the gates.\nWhite stone buildings stood in straight rows, lining clean, orderly streets. The first stories all appeared to be shops, while the second",
    "query_text": "-floor windows were festooned with flowers. Everywhere she looked were smiling faces, citizens turned out to witness their prince\u2019s return over the smooth brick roads. Overlooking it all was the towering magnificence of the imperial palace.\n\u201cThe capital is the seat of power in Galkhein,\u201d Arnold explained. \u201cSeveral key trade routes converge here.\u201d\nRishe nodded, suddenly anxious to be out of the coach. More and more people were gathering to watch their progress, some carrying shopping bags in both arms or holding hands with children. Many of them waved, as if greeting someone dear to them.\nHappy citizens and clean, orderly streets meant wealth. Galkhein was well-off. Rishe couldn\u2019t help but grin at an adorable little girl watching them roll by"

Those pretty hands of yours don\u2019t look like they\u2019ve ever held a broom,\u201d said one of them.\n\u201cUnfortunately for you, we\u2019ve been working here three years, and we\u2019ll be the ones to serve Prince Arnold as the maids of his palace.\u201d\n\u201cCan you stand? Oh, good, it looks like you\u2019re not injured.\u201d Rishe helped the girl up out of the dirt. \n\u201cHey, don\u2019t ignore us!\u201d the redheaded maid shouted. \u201cYou\u2019ve got some nerve. If you want to make it here, you\u2019ll know your place! I doubt the two of you will last a week!\u201d\nRishe didn\u2019t respond, her attention snagging on something else. The redhead was carrying curtains, probably to bring them to the wash. Rishe stared at them so hard the maid began to shift uncomfortably. \u201cWhat\u2019s your problem?\u201d\n\u201cYou should wait to wash those,\u201d Rishe said.\nThe girl glared daggers at her. \u201cExcuse me? Are you telling me it\u2019s too late in the day? You really are an amateur! The light lasts longer in the spring, you know. And it\u2019s hot today. There\u2019ll be plenty of\u2014\u201d \n\u201cIt\u2019s going to rain, is all.\u201d\nThe maids exchanged glances. \u201cHow can you be so sure?\u201d\n\u201cLook at the clouds amassing. The butterflies and the bees are flying low. The moisture in the air will make the drying take longer.\u201d\n\u201cWhat?\u201d\nAnother maid spoke up in a soft voice. \u201cDiana, you were the one who said we should take the initiative to wash the bigger pieces. You said the crown prince would choose us for his household!\u201d\n\u201cStop putting the blame on me! This isn\u2019t my fault.\u201d An indignant flush crept over the redhead\u2019s face. \u201cThere\u2019s no way some upstart can tell what time it\u2019s going to rain! The weather is going to be fantastic all day. Come on, we\u2019re hauling these over to the wash!\u201d\nThe three girls meekly followed Diana.\nRishe sighed, turning to the blonde girl. \u201cAre you hurt?\u201d\n\u201cNo, I\u2019m fine.\u201d The girl\u2019s gaze darted around nervously. \u201cI\u2019m Elsie. Thank you for helping me.\u201d Her face was studiously blank, but from the way she struggled with her words, Rishe could tell she was being genuine.\n\u201cDon\u2019t worry about it,\u201d Rishe said. \u201cYour uniform seems to have fared less well.\u201d\n\u201cOh no.\u201d Elsie looked down at herself. Her face remained vacant, but she seemed sad. \u201cAnd I just got it.\u201d \n\u201cYou can get the dirt out if you wash it straight away. It\u2019s going to rain, but this dress should dry quickly. Use lots of soap, but don\u2019t scrub it by hand\u2014scrape the mud off with a brush.\u201d\n\u201cWhy a brush?\u201d\n\u201cBecause your fingers will just grind dirt into the threads. A brush is more porous.\u201d\nThe young sons of the family Rishe served spent their time tumbling in the dirt, and she had plenty of experience scraping mud out of clothes. She could even salvage dirty socks that had spent days crumpled in the corner.\n\u201cDo you\u2026 Are you\u2026\u201d Elsie trailed off, blinking rapidly a couple of times before finally looking Rishe in the eyes. \u201cAre you the crown princess\u2019s maid?\u201d\nUnsure how to answer, Rishe couldn\u2019t meet her eyes.\n \n***\n \nAfter parting ways with Elsie, Rishe returned to the detached wing with her fresh water. She put clean sheets on the bed the knights had installed, satisfied that she had a comfortable place to sleep. This room also had the highest-up balcony in the whole detached palace.\nTaking a break, she wandered out onto the balcony and looked off over the capital, the golden afternoon tinged with the onset of twilight. The day was fresh with a recent rain, the air clear enough to see for miles. The spring breeze felt good against her skin, sweaty from cleaning. Rishe leaned against the railing, leaning her head back and closing her eyes.\nShe felt like collapsing into bed immediately, but she desperately needed a wash. Still, she didn\u2019t want to pull herself away from the view and the breeze just yet. When she resumed gazing out absentmindedly, something her mother once said drifted back to her. \n\u201cRishe, there is no need for you to think for yourself.\u201d\nShe frowned, the memories coming thick and fast now.\n\u201cYou mustn\u2019t forget that the duty of our family is to live our lives fully devoted to the kings of the land. You\u2019re smart, but all the thinking in the world won\u2019t do a woman any good. You need only concern yourself with how best to serve the crown prince.\u201d\n\u201cStudies? Focus on social etiquette\u2014that\u2019s what you need for navigating high society. The crown prince\u2019s bride must be flawless. Your smile is lacking. You must always strive to appear amiable.\u201d\nRishe breathed out a long sigh. When I was fifteen, their lectures were the only thing I thought about.\nHer parents preached constantly. \u201cA woman\u2019s true happiness is to marry a suitable man and give birth to his heirs.\u201d\n\u201cBut, Mother\u2026\u201d\nObjection was not permitted. Any argument was immediately dispensed with. As a woman, Rishe could not inherit her father\u2019s title. Her only value was in her marriage. \nDespite knowing now that the opinions of others were as worthless as empty titles, the words still echoed in her memories.\nRishe\u2019s fingertips twitched, and she opened her eyes. Unmoving, she said, \u201cShouldn\u2019t you be seeing to your duties?\u201d\n\u201cMore hidden depths, I see,\u201d came a voice tinged with pleasure. Rishe straightened and turned. There was Arnold, leaning against the door to the balcony. \u201cYou seem able to sense my approach no matter how far or how hard I try.\u201d\n\u201cYou\u2019re quite naughty, aren\u2019t you? You\u2019ve been making your presence known little by little, emanating threat, to see how quickly I catch on.\u201d\n\u201cSo you noticed that as well.\u201d Arnold joined Rishe on the balcony. She tensed, but all he did was cast a curious glance at the view. \u201cWhat were you looking at?\u201d\n\u201cThe city.\u201d Rishe was hardly going to tell him she\u2019d been looking at nothing, merely ruminating on her mother\u2019s overbearing advice. The view from the balcony was spectacular, though. \u201cWhat\u2019s that over there?\u201d\n\u201cYou mean the library? The state invested funds to expand it. We have books from all over the world.\u201d\n\u201cReally? You have a library that big?\u201d Rishe\u2019s eyes sparkled with delight. She pointed out another building. \u201cWhat about that spire? It\u2019s beautiful.\u201d\n\u201cThe church and clock tower. The bells ring out the hour.\u201d\n\u201cOoh, how wonderful! And it looks like there\u2019s a rather big market there too?\u201d\n\u201cYes, the largest market in the city. Carts line up in the early morning. Most of the offerings are made fresh every day.\u201d\n\u201cAmazing! And what about that pretty mountain over there?\u201d\nRishe tried and failed to contain her excitement. She couldn\u2019t help but imagine what seeing all these places up close would be like. The grand library, the beautiful church that told the time, and the morning market with fresh, delicious food\u2014she wanted to experience it all.\nSeeing Arnold\u2019s bemused face, she said, \u201cWhat?\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m just wondering where all this interest is coming from,\u201d he said. \u201cYou were so reluctant to come, yet here you are, brimming with curiosity for my city.\u201d\n\u201cWell\u2026\u201d she trailed off, unsure of how to respond.\nWhat should I say? Should I just tell him the truth?\nThis wasn\u2019t a secret, but talking about her hopes and dreams to the man who had killed her was a little awkward. A strange self-consciousness settled on her, her cheeks heating as she mumbled, \u201cBecause I\u2019ve always wanted to.\u201d\nArnold looked at her keenly. \u201cWanted to what?\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019ve always wanted to come here.\u201d\nDuring her life as a merchant, Rishe developed her single dream to visit everywhere in the world. That dream was cut tragically short when only one country remained: Galkhein.\nIn each of her consecutive lives, Rishe\u2019s priority became staying alive. Every time, without fail, just as she found her footing, the world was plunged into chaos. She never had the chance to see Galkhein. This betrothal was her chance. \u201cIt\u2019s probably why I agreed to marry you,\u201d she added after a moment\u2019s hesitation.\nArnold swept a tepid glance over the city. \u201cThere\u2019s nothing here worth seeing.\u201d\n\u201cThat\u2019s not true! The places you just told me about sound amazing! Your citizens are clean and happy, your knights are proper and kind. Oh, and another\u2014\u201d \nRishe broke off enumerating Galkhein\u2019s charms as Arnold turned to look at her. His face was impassively calm, but something seemed to pass by underneath, like a shadow in deep water.\n\u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d Rishe said. \u201cDid I say something odd?\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m just amazed you could be so unaware of yourself.\u201d \nWh-what a rude thing to\u2014\n\u201cI\u2019ve never met anyone like you. No one has ever spoken to me the way you do. I don\u2019t know any girls of your class with the knowledge or the physical abilities you possess. Noblewomen don\u2019t concern themselves with such things.\u201d\nRishe, there is no need for you to think for yourself.\nShe frowned. \u201cPerhaps you\u2019re right, but everything I\u2019ve learned is precious to me. No one can take my skills away\u2014I value them with my life. Some may say that my knowledge is worthless, but it makes no difference to me.\u201d She turned from the balcony, fixing him with a piercing gaze. \u201cI\u2019m the one who decides what I value.\u201d\nRishe had clawed free of her mother and father\u2019s indoctrination a long time ago. Man, woman\u2014it didn\u2019t matter. She could do anything. Being queen was not the culmination of her life; she wouldn\u2019t trade her freedom for anything.\nArnold matched her intensity. \u201cYou\u2019re right.\u201d He gently cupped her cheek in a one hand, swiping his thumb along the line of her jaw, smearing dust. \u201cLive your life here however you wish. I vow to do my utmost to protect you.\u201d\n\u201cHuh?\u201d\nHis vehemence took her by surprise. Arnold had every right to demand she act the part of a proper consort. This was a political marriage; Rishe was essentially a hostage, after all. Yet here he was, cosigning her misbehavior. Moreover, he was all but swearing to defend her from the consequences.\n\u201cWhy?\u201d\n\u201cYou know why. I\u2019m enamored with you.\u201d Arnold fed her the same line. \u201cI know you said you don\u2019t care about other people\u2019s approval, but I like your asymmetrical talents. I don\u2019t find them useless at all.\u201d \nRishe didn\u2019t know how to respond.\n\u201cI thought I\u2019d already made that clear.\u201d He took his hand back, drawing away, stopping just on the threshold. He turned back to a stunned Rishe and said, \u201cLet me know if there\u2019s anything you desire. I realize I just broke our agreement\u2014the one about not touching you.\u201d\nAnd with that, he was gone.\nShaken, Rishe sank to the floor of the balcony. I can\u2019t predict him at all! Just what is Arnold Hein planning?\nThe quiet of evening fell over the imperial capital of Galkhein.\n \n***\n \n\u201cMmm.\u201d\nSunshine streamed through the window as Rishe roused from sleep. She rolled over, basking in the morning light. The wall she expected wasn\u2019t there, and the bed seemed larger than usual. Taking advantage of it, she stretched out as far as she could.\nWas this her chamber at home? Or maybe she was a merchant again, spending a night at the desert king\u2019s palace. Perhaps this was her bed of straw from her life as a maid? Her memories met and interwove as she drifted into wakefulness.\nWhen Rishe finally opened her eyes, she grew even more confused.\nLight blue curtains surrounded the bed, thin enough to allow sunlight to pass through. She pulled them aside to find herself in a bare room devoid of furniture and carpet.\nOh, right. She didn\u2019t need to report for morning training, tend to her herb garden, prepare breakfast, or see how the bottles she had brewed overnight were coming along.\nRealizing that, Rishe buried her face in the pillow. \u201cSo soft,\u201d she murmured. \nJudging by the position of the sun, it was about six o\u2019clock in the morning. She was pretty sure she had gone to bed around midnight last night.\nI slept for six whole hours? Rishe couldn\u2019t believe it. Generally, she was used to getting about four hours of sleep. On bad days, at the height of an emergency as a knight or apothecary, she wouldn\u2019t even get that much. \nI\u2019ve got nothing but cleaning on the schedule today. Hostages can sleep in, right? At least a little? Excitement suffused her at the thought, but that was interrupted by a knock on the door.\n\u201cLady Rishe, are you awake? It\u2019s Oliver\u2014Prince Arnold\u2019s attendant.\u201d\nRishe sat up with a start. \u201cI\u2019m awake!\u201d\nOliver continued to speak through the door. \u201cI apologize for bothering you at such an early hour. I\u2019m here with a delivery.\u201d\n\u201cJust a moment!\u201d Rishe slipped out of the bed, dressed quickly, and tugged the bed\u2019s canopy closed. She opened the door to find Oliver standing in the hallway with a polite smile.\nHe apologized again. \u201cThis was the only time I could slip away from His Highness\u2019s office. I\u2019m glad to see that you\u2019re already dressed.\u201d\n\u201cNot at all.\u201d Rishe paused, stepping back to allow him inside. \u201cOh my. You look exhausted.\u201d\nOliver grimaced. \u201cIs it that obvious? We\u2019ve been climbing through mountains of paperwork, but never mind me. His Highness has been working around the clock.\u201d\nRishe thought back to yesterday, how he had come all the way out to the balcony. He should have used that spare time to sleep. \u201cHe\u2019s in high demand, isn\u2019t he? He was even working on the trip over.\u201d\n\u201cHe finished all the work he brought along with us,\u201d Oliver confirmed. \u201cNow he\u2019s dealing with everything that piled up during his visit to Hermity.\u201d\n\u201cOh.\u201d Rishe grimaced in sympathy. He may have killed her in a past life, but she wouldn\u2019t wish the bureaucracy of kingship on anyone. \u201cIt\u2019s a shame he had to put his work on hold to attend a silly engagement party.\u201d\n\u201cNo matter. That party was how a committed bachelor finally found a bride.\u201d\nHis smile was sincere, but Rishe knew better. She spread her arms. \u201cGo on. Shall I spin around so you have a better view?\u201d\nOliver blinked. \u201cI beg your pardon?\u201d\n\u201cYou\u2019re looking me over like I\u2019m a horse for sale. If there\u2019s anything I can help you with, please let me know.\u201d\nOliver\u2019s brows went up. He let out a little breath of resignation. \u201cHis Highness was right. You do possess the keen perception of a knight. Of course, I\u2019m purely an amateur myself.\u201d\nI\u2019d say this was a merchant\u2019s sixth sense, rather than battle intuition.\nThis wasn\u2019t the first time Rishe had caught Oliver looking at her. It reminded her of the way her noble customers would examine a product, assessing worth and authenticity. Or a merchant weeding out potential merchandise from a wide array of choices.\nIn other words, he was appraising her.\nOliver moved into a deep, sweeping bow. \u201cMy sincerest apologies, my lady. I have been unaccountably rude to my lord\u2019s consort. My behavior was unacceptable.\u201d\nRishe shook her head. \u201cPlease don\u2019t, it\u2019s fine.\u201d It wasn\u2019t unreasonable for the prince\u2019s closest attendant to be wary of strangers. But it did make her curious. \u201cHow long have you worked for Arnold? Have you always been a valet?\u201d\n\u201cI trained as a squire, actually,\u201d Oliver replied. \u201cBut I was injured and dismissed from the order. His Highness took me into his household soon after. I have served him for nearly a decade.\u201d\n\u201cThen maybe you can answer this,\u201d Rishe said. \u201cWhy is Prince Arnold so very intent on making me his wife?\u201d\nOliver hesitated, as if weighing the pros and cons of speaking, \u201cTo be quite honest, I was as surprised as you were. He\u2019s always insisted he had no interest in marriage. But the sight of you in Hermity has changed his mind. Apparently.\u201d\nSo not even his attendant understood his motives. Rishe remained at a complete loss.\n\u201cIf I may, however?\u201d Oliver mistook Rishe\u2019s confusion for anxiety and added, \u201cI have served Prince Arnold for a long time, and never before have I seen him so",
    "query_text": " happy. When he is with you, he laughs. His smiles are sincere.\u201d\nRishe was taken aback. She\u2019d figured all of Arnold\u2019s laughter and teasing was at her expense. His own private jokes.\n\u201cAre you\u2026unhappy with him?\u201d Oliver ventured. \u201cWith his looks, His Highness is exceedingly popular with the ladies of the court, you know.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m sure he has many admirers.\u201d She paused. \u201cWould you really call the way he acts around me \u2018happy\u2019? To me, it seems more like a cat with a mouse.\u201d\nOliver laughed. He didn\u2019t deny it. \u201cI am pleased you understand His Highness so well. Oh, I nearly"

I\u2019d say it\u2019s a rather small gathering, actually.\u201d\n\u201cMaybe for a military powerhouse,\u201d Rishe muttered. \nYet another reminder of Galkhein\u2019s wealth took her off guard. Arnold just looked bored.\n\u201cThe size doesn\u2019t matter,\u201d he said. \u201cIn the end, they\u2019re only here for gossip. Look, here they come.\u201d\nIn the blink of an eye, they were surrounded by guests.\n\u201cPrince Arnold, thank you for gracing us with an invitation,\u201d said one man. \u201cSuch a pleasure.\u201d \n\u201cThe pleasure is mine, Lord Abel,\u201d Arnold drawled.\n\u201cYour Highness! We were so glad to hear of your safe return,\u201d another guest chirped. \u201cPlease, our daughter is simply dying to be regaled with tales of your trip.\u201d\n\u201cI can\u2019t imagine I\u2019d have anything particularly exciting to share with her,\u201d Arnold said curtly.\nAfter the last few days, Rishe found this look of glazed apathy disturbing. His good looks only compounded it\u2014he was so handsome that every expression was stark.\nHe looks more like Emperor Arnold Hein now, but still not the same.\nArnold appeared to notice her watching him. When he looked at her, his sourness disappeared, replaced by a genuine smile. All around him, women found themselves flushing. Arnold paid no heed to their fervent gazes, instead leaning in to give Rishe a brief moment of consideration.\nThen he leaned in close enough to kiss her.\n\u201cA dull trip,\u201d he said again, pulling away. \u201cBut fortuitous. Without it, I would have never met the woman destined to be my wife.\u201d\nA shocked murmur rolled through the crowd. Rishe, who hadn\u2019t recovered from seeing Arnold\u2019s beautiful face at close range, barely noticed the looks of utter loathing the assembled women were throwing her.\n\u201cH-His Highness is smiling? At his hostage bride?\u201d\n\u201cHe called her his wife?! He\u2019s never even looked at us!\u201d\nThey were whispers, but they carried.\nA portly man stepped forward with his daughter in tow. \u201cYour Highness, do you mean to say that this lovely young woman is your fianc\u00e9e?\u201d\nEvery eye in the ballroom was on Rishe, alight with curiosity, envy, or schemes. None of them could hide their contempt. But Rishe didn\u2019t falter.\nThis is nothing compared to being publicly dumped in a banquet hall. And I\u2019ve done that seven times!\nShe offered a polite smile and an astoundingly correct curtsy. Left leg at a diagonal behind the right, back straight, head bowed. \u201cHow do you do? My name is Rishe Irmgard Weitzner.\u201d\nEven the most hostile guests could find nothing impolite in her greeting, no sign of rough manners from the rustic daughter of a backwater nation. Rishe had years of training in expectation of ascending to the throne. Occasionally, habits from her other lives slipped through, but Arnold appeared to be the only one who noticed.\nNow he was looking at her with satisfaction. \u201cLady Rishe has only just arrived, and her acquaintances are few and far between. I hope I can count on you all to hold me accountable should I prove an incompetent husband.\u201d\n\u201cB-but of course, Your Highness.\u201d\n\u201cCome, Rishe.\u201d Arnold guided her out of the ring of spectators. The stares continued to follow them as they walked away.\nRishe dropped her voice to a whisper. \u201cYou sure know how to invite the ire of women.\u201d\n\u201cWhatever do you mean?\u201d\n\u201cThe way you harped on about me. Everything you said was tailor-made to stoke their jealousy. You\u2019ve gained me enemies, so thanks for that.\u201d\nArnold snorted. \u201cEverything I said was to protect you from enemies. They need to know you aren\u2019t just some trophy they can eliminate without recourse. We need to show them this to forestall any potential moves against you in the future.\n\u201cShow them what, exactly?\u201d\n\u201cThat I\u2019ll protect you no matter what.\u201d\nHe said it with such nonchalance that it brought her up short. Protect me? Arnold Hein, protect me?\nSuch an ironic position to take. She couldn\u2019t tell him that, of course. Her response came out somewhat strangled. \u201cI doubt they\u2019ll be anything to worry about. In fact, the biggest threat facing me is you.\u201d\n\u201cOh? And why do you say that?\u201d\n\u201cFor many reasons, the most obvious being that I\u2019m no match for you with a blade.\u201d As much as it pained her to admit it.\nArnold looked pleased. \u201cPerhaps we should duel.\u201d\n\u201cYes, please! And if it wouldn\u2019t be an intrusion\u2014I would like to train with you.\u201d If she studied him, she could learn his strategies and his attack patterns. She\u2019d never be a match in speed or raw power, but any insight would be invaluable.\n\u201cSure.\u201d Arnold shrugged. \u201cI don\u2019t mind.\u201d\n\u201cTruly?\u201d Her eyes glittered with anticipation.\nHe chuckled. \u201cYour answers never disappoint me.\u201d\n\u201cWhat\u2019s that supposed to mean? Oh, it looks like they\u2019re playing a new song.\u201d\nA soft melody drifted across the hall. The crowd divided, heading toward the center of the floor or against the wall. The next dance was starting, and everyone was waiting to see what the crown prince and his new fianc\u00e9e would do.\n\u201cWe don\u2019t have to dance if you don\u2019t want to,\u201d Arnold said.\n\u201cOh? As it happens, I like dancing.\u201d Plus, she couldn\u2019t resist a blatant challenge. She offered him her hand.\n\u201cVery well, then.\u201d Arnold only hesitated for a moment before taking it and steering her gently to an empty spot on the floor. He didn\u2019t seem like the dancing type, but his movements were slick and effortless. Facing one another, they joined hands. Arnold wrapped his other arm around her waist. \nOoh. His hand felt huge against her back. She realized she was breathing a little faster. They\u2019d never been this close before.\nNo, that isn\u2019t quite true. This is the second time. Rishe\u2019s final memories from her last life flashed vividly through her mind.\nThis was indeed the second time they had been this close\u2014the first had ended with a sword through her chest.\nEmperor Arnold Hein had single-handedly decimated the knights in the castle. Rishe stood in the midst of the carnage, breath ragged as she gripped the hilt of her sword, slick with her own blood. She was the last line of defense. The chamber behind her housed the royal family.\nIf they could reach the hidden passageways, the young prince and his party could find shelter with their allies across the border. Rishe and the other knights were prepared to sacrifice their lives to allow the royal family to survive. Their escape meant victory.\nBells tolled out, urging flight. All is lost. Run. Rishe managed to graze Arnold\u2019s cheek with her blade before she looked down to find his jet-black sword blooming out of her chest.\nShe remembered how it burned, as if the blade was made of fire. It was heat, not pain, but her breathing grew labored, and when Emperor Arnold Hein withdrew his sword, Rishe crumpled. \nHe knelt by her side and whispered something.\nThe words were seared into her memory. Rishe squeezed Arnold\u2019s hand as they danced.\nI\u2019ll be the bully this time. \nRishe shifted her weight back, slipping out of the hold on her waist. She broke Arnold\u2019s lead and spun, drifting on the harmony of the dance. She took him by surprise; his eyes went wide.\nI wonder what you\u2019ll do when you\u2019re no longer on top, Your Highness. Her smile was a declaration of war",
    "query_text": ". Watching him attempt to follow her lead would be delightful. She pulled his hand toward her, attempting to move them into a spin.\nBut Arnold held fast. He planted his hand on her waist and turned them in a different direction, using her inertia against her. Hey! As a result, Rishe twirled by herself on the spot.\nShe didn\u2019t miss a step. She turned elegantly, the"

I\u2019ll tell Oliver to make that a priority.\u201d\n\u201cAh, I can do the selection myself. We needn\u2019t trouble him.\u201d\nArnold arched an amused brow.

She picked up her empty glass. \u201cI\u2019m merely concerned about the servants\u2019 working conditions.\u201d\nTo protect her life and well-being, she needed to keep from dying at twenty years old again. And to do that, she had to prevent Arnold Hein\u2019s war. Her best bet would be to appeal to the important people she\u2019d known in her past lives. People with influence.\nPlus, there was a mountain of things she needed to do in preparation for the marriage ceremony.\nI need to sow a plot of land, grow herbs, do lots of shopping, get cheap alcohol, and then\u2026 \nRishe began a to-do list that had nothing to do with war in the least.\n \n***\n \nAs the ball wound to a close, a lone boy stood in the gloomy courtyard of the imperial palace. He had soft black hair and round blue eyes. No older than sixteen, he had an androgynous grace to him, gaze fixed on the balcony above. \nHe was watching a girl.\nShe had coral-colored hair, and even from this distance, he could tell she was beautiful. She stood there alone, apparently waiting for someone. Whoever it was must have shown up because her hand slipped from the banister, and she stepped away. Not too long after, a man appeared where she had been standing.\nThe man turned a silent glare down into the garden, as if he\u2019d known the boy had been there the whole time, despite the shadows.\nA shiver ran down the boy\u2019s spine and he smiled reflexively, delighting in the intense aura of threat the man gave off. It was just a warning, it seemed, as the man abruptly turned on his heel and disappeared. \n\u201cAww, we can\u2019t play together either?\u201d The boy hung his head. \u201cI miss you, Brother.\u201d\nIt had to be the woman. The beauty. She\u2019d made the boy\u2019s life hell since the day she arrived. \nHis brother had prohibited him from attending balls like this one. That was fine; he\u2019d sooner avoid them altogether. Still, he\u2019d wanted to meet that girl. \n\u201cBut we\u2019ll meet soon enough, won\u2019t we?\u201d He spoke to himself in a soft voice. \u201cI\u2019ve got plans for you, Sister.\u201d \n\n(2) chapter number given is likely out of range: 0\nChapter: 8\n\nChapter 3\nChapter 3\n \n\u201cYOU\u2019RE ALL SO USELESS!\u201d Diana the redheaded maid\u2019s voice rang out inside the stone washhouse. \nThree days had passed since the afternoon Rishe shook off her guard and came out to the well. Rishe was once again dressed to fit in with the maids. At Diana\u2019s shout, she looked up without pausing in her work. \n\u201cIs even laundry beyond your capabilities? I asked you to wash these this morning, and now it\u2019s past noon! Meanwhile, we\u2019ve finished cleaning the entire first floor in a third of the time!\u201d\n\u201cI-I\u2019m sorry, Diana.\u201d\nThe new maids went silent with shame. Among them was Elsie, the girl Rishe stood up for the other day. Rishe pulled her hands out of the soapy water, gently rinsed them, and said, \u201cLet me help. What still needs to be done?\u201d\n\u201cYou again?\u201d Diana rounded on Rishe. \u201cI don\u2019t know who you serve, but I\u2019m amazed you have the time to do other people\u2019s work. I wish I had so much free time.\u201d\nHuffily, she turned from Rishe. \u201cLet\u2019s just ignore these useless fools. Laura, Maya. Come on. If we want to be chosen as Lady Rishe\u2019s maids, we mustn\u2019t waste our time.\u201d\nDiana took out a slip of paper from her pocket, smoothing it out. \u201cIt looks like the new bedsheets for her palace will arrive today. We should inspect them to make sure everything is perfect!\u201d\n\u201cWait up, Diana!\u201d\nThe two maids followed Diana out. Rishe waited for the door to close before turning to Elsie and the others. \u201cLet\u2019s keep working. If there\u2019s anything too large and cumbersome, feel free to pass it over to me.\u201d\n\u201cTh-thank you so much!\u201d The new maids went weak with gratitude. One of them, a girl on the verge of tears, even fell into a full bow. Rishe muttered encouragement as she scrubbed some bedsheets.\nElsie, who was washing the sheets with her, wore a rueful look. \u201cI\u2019m so sorry for the trouble. We\u2019re just not learning fast enough.\u201d\n\u201cYou haven\u2019t been working here long, have you? It takes time to learn a new job, no matter who you are,\u201d Rishe said as she kept scrubbing. \u201cAnd it\u2019s not like you\u2019ve never washed a single thing in your life before, right?\u201d\nElsie nodded nervously. \nRishe had realized over the past few days doing the laundry that not all the newcomers were complete amateurs. They\u2019d obviously done chores at home, or something similar. When set a specific task, they could perform it properly, but Diana\u2019s complaints weren\u2019t unfounded. They did take far too much time with laundry.\nBut it\u2019s obvious why. \u201cDo you know anything about Diana?\u201d Rishe asked Elsie. \u201cLike, is she from a well-off family?\u201d\nElsie said, \u201cI heard that her father was a business owner. She worked with him.\u201d\n\u201cI heard that as well,\u201d added another maid. \u201cBut he fell into debt and had to sell off.\u201d \nRishe stopped scrubbing for a moment to consider this.\n\u201cUm, is something the matter?\u201d Elsie asked.\nRishe smiled and shook her head. \u201cNo, nothing. Let\u2019s just focus on getting these washed for the time being.\u201d\n \n***\n \nThat afternoon, thirty maids were assembled in the detached wing of the palace. Ten of them were old hands, long in service to the royal family, while the other twenty were freshly hired. The crown princess was to choose her maids from among these thirty. They wore their nerves plainly on their sleeves. \n\u201cHey, I thought this palace was in a terrible state of neglect,\u201d one maid whispered. \u201cWhy is it so sparkling clean?\u201d\n\u201cYeah, you\u2019re right,\u201d said another. \u201cSomeone must have sorted it out before we arrived.\u201d\n\u201cI wonder what kind of person Lady Rishe is. Ooh, I\u2019m so nervous.\u201d\nThe girls looked around anxiously.\n\u201cHey, Elsie, that girl who was always helping us isn\u2019t here.\u201d\nElsie blinked. \u201cYou\u2019re right.\u201d\n\u201cLook, Diana. That impertinent newbie didn\u2019t get picked.\u201d \nAt her friend\u2019s observation, Diana preened with satisfaction. \u201cNo surprise there. You need some manners to attend to Lady Rishe. I bet she got kicked out of the running!\u201d Her eyes sparkled with confidence.\nAt last, there was a knock at the door.\n\u201cHer Royal Highness, Princess Rishe.\u201d\nThe maids quickly fell into bows. Diana\u2019s chest ached with anticipation as heels clicked on the floor, approaching the line of girls. From the corner of their eyes, the maids saw a wide-skirted court dress. A gentle scent washed over them.\nWithout even looking at her, they could tell Crown Princess Rishe was a lovely woman. Diana and her friends swelled with pride that she was to become their mistress.\nBut then Laura whispered to Diana, \u201cHey, isn\u2019t this scent familiar?\u201d\n\u201cQuiet!\u201d Clearly it was some sort of expensive perfume. Or so Diana thought, but then she realized what it was. The words just slipped out. \u201cIt\u2019s soap.\u201d\n\u201cHuh? Did you just say something?\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s soap. The same kind we always use.\u201d Diana was sure of it.\nThe princess said, \u201cPlease rise.\u201d \nWhy did her voice sound so familiar? An incredible foreboding gripping her, Diana looked up. She gasped.\n\u201cMy name is Rishe Irmgard Weitzner.\u201d\nBefore her stood the beautiful newcomer\u2014the thorn in her side for the past few days. The smile she wore was peaceful and just the slightest bit satisfied.\n \n***\n \nI\u2019m so glad I managed to finish washing the sheets in time!\nStanding before the maids with Arnold\u2019s attendant Oliver at her side, Rishe was panicking on the inside. She\u2019d had so much to do this morning that she\u2019d put off the laundry to the last minute. She took deep, controlled breaths, praying no one would notice that she\u2019d raced here at a dead sprint.\nOliver was none the wiser as he spoke to the assembled girls. Rishe took the opportunity to look them over. She locked eyes with Elsie, who was gaping at her. It was a nice change\u2014usually her face was as blank as a rock wall.\nI\u2019m sorry for the deception. I figured blending in would give me the best picture of your working conditions.\nThe new maids wore similarly shocked expressions, while others watched her with delight. Meanwhile, the veterans, including Diana, had all gone pale. They trembled, stunned into silence. One seemed locked in a terrifying trance, while another looked on the verge of tears. All of them had spoken to Rishe with derision. As the ringleader, Diana was covering her mouth with both hands, like she was holding in a scream.\nOliver had finished his introduction. \u201cYour Highness, if you would?\u201d\nRishe stepped forward. \u201cFirst, I must apologize to you for what has transpired prior to this meeting. My deception, that is. However, it has granted me insight into how each one of you works.\u201d\nOliver\u2019s face creased in confusion. The newcomer maids began to panic, whispering among themselves.\n\u201cDoesn\u2019t this mean that she helped us out with the laundry?\u201d\n\u201cWe\u2019re going to be fired!\u201d\n\u201cIf I lose my position, my brother will have to quit school!\u201d\nNoticing the commotion, Oliver glanced at Rishe. \u201cYour Highness, two-thirds of these maids are newly recruited from the city. Since the majority of the castle maids were elderly, His Highness assumed you would prefer maids closer in age to yourself.\u201d\nRishe was startled. She had found it odd that most of her potential servants were new hires, but she hadn\u2019t expected this to be the reason.\n\u201cWhile the prince has entrusted the selection of your maids to you,\u201d Oliver went on. \u201cHiring someone with no experience will not do. Despite Prince Arnold\u2019s views, I urge you to reject the newcomers.\u201d\n\u201cOliver.\u201d\n\u201cI have a list of their names here. Elsie\u2014\u201d\n\u201cElsie, Nichole, Hilde, Marguerite, Rosa.\u201d Rishe began listing the names of the newly recruited maids. She",

Even though they\u2019ve never served you in the past?\u201d\n\u201cYes, of course I do. Servants are essential to the maintenance of our lifestyle, why wouldn\u2019t I get to know them?\u201d Rishe listed the remaining names for good measure. \u201cAll twenty of you, listen to me.\u201d \nThe new maids stiffened.

    "prefix_text": " build her business from the ground up, but personal connections were almost as essential to being a merchant as business savvy. It just wasn\u2019t realistic without a single acquaintance. \nSorting through her belongings in resignation, she came across a foreign encyclopedia of herbs among her grandmother\u2019s books. Taking it as a sign, Rishe sold her jewels elsewhere and used the funds to cross the sea and pursue the study of medicine.\nFortunately, Rishe retained all her knowledge from her previous life. She remembered that certain expensive herbs could be acquired cheaply in other regions. When word spread of a disease running rampant in a neighboring country, she recalled that too. This foreknowledge proved invaluable, as did her wide travel and exposure to many different teachers with many different points of view.\nAs such, Rishe led a successful life as an apothecary. She saved a feeble prince, synthesized a number of rare medicines with her mercantile knowledge, and thus spent her days in the simple joy of helping those in need.\nUnfortunately, all the joy in the world couldn\u2019t stand up to an epidemic. Thus ended her second life. \nOnce again, she found herself in the moment of her broken engagement, the curtain rising on the third loop. Her next four lives proceeded much the same way. As a skilled lady\u2019s maid, she helped a young noblewoman to a fortuitous marriage. Once, she even disguised herself as a man and became a knight. Every life was worth living, and she enjoyed them all. She enjoyed living, period.\nThere was just one problem.\nNo matter what I do, I die at twenty.\nShe enjoyed her lives, but she was not permitted to do so for long. With this time limit always hanging over her, she spent each loop in a state of constant activity.\nI would love to take it easy for a while. Is a little leisure time too much to ask? Obviously I don\u2019t want to die either! This time, I\u2019ll make as much money as I can in the first five years. Then, when I turn twenty, I\u2019ll live a life free of worldly cares. I\u2019ll do whatever\u2019s necessary to stay alive!\nHer mind made up, Rishe began her seventh life in a dead sprint through the palace. Regardless of her future plans, she was in a race against time. She needed to beat the messenger bearing news of her scandal.\nAs she ran, she yanked off her hair ornaments; she planned to sell them and didn\u2019t want to risk losing one. Her hair billowed out behind her, falling in loose waves.\nSuddenly, an idea occurred to her, one she hadn\u2019t had in any of her previous six lives.\nLeaving through the palace gardens would be faster. I can climb down a tree from the balcony.\nRishe had gone to war as a knight in the life just before this one. After the punishing battlefield training, climbing trees was nothing.\nSeamlessly, she changed direction. She raced for the balcony, where she ran into something at full speed.\n\u201cBwargh!\u201d Rishe let out a very unladylike grunt, staggering a few steps. She looked up to see what she\u2019d bounced off of. \u201cOh\u2026\u201d\nAn exceptionally handsome man stood in her path.\nHe had refined, patrician features and cruel, thin lips. He was slender yet powerful; even through his clothes, Rishe could tell his body was well conditioned. His jet-black hair covered his ears, creeping down to the nape of his neck. The tips of his locks bounced with his movements. They looked to be soft to the touch.\nFrom head to toe, he was a pleasure to look at\u2014but what held Rishe\u2019s attention were his eyes. They were long in shape and impossibly blue, but they possessed a blade-sharp intensity. His gaze was clear, beautiful, and cold as ice. His eyelashes cast shadows on his striking face. He was a work of art.\nCurrently, this work of art was staring her down with a look that could kill.\nHe laughed. \u201cYou barreled right into me. For a moment, I thought I\u2019d been attacked by a wild boar.\u201d\nIt was an exceedingly rude thing to say to a stranger, but as luck would have it, this man was not a stranger. At least not to Rishe.\n\u201cWhat are you even doing here?\u201d the man went on. \u201cThe party is in the\u2014\u201d\nRishe interrupted him with a wordless shout of dismay. The man drew back, reflexively reaching for his sword. He composed himself with visible difficulty. \u201cWho are you? You look like any noblewoman, but your manner is\u2026\u201d \n\u201cEmperor Arnold Hein!\u201d \nThe man\u2019s eyes widened. He didn\u2019t mistake her surging contempt. Rishe had crossed swords with this man. Recently. He was the one responsible for ending her sixth life. \nHe must be a guest at the banquet. It makes sense.\nArnold Hein was the scion of a military nation not far from Rishe\u2019s home country of Hermity, the one in which they now stood. Their kingdoms, so recently at war, had brokered an ostensible peace, and the two ruling families met from time to time. Crown Prince Dietrich\u2019s engagement party would be one such occasion. He\u2019d gathered elites from far and wide to introduce to his beloved Mary.\nThe man eyed Rishe with rising curiosity. \u201cYou know me? This is my first time in Hermity.\u201d\nUh-oh. Rishe pasted on a smile as her mind spun in circles. This man was dangerous. She had to avoid entanglements with him at all costs. Five years from now, Arnold Hein would invade Hermity. \nHe was an extraordinarily skilled swordsman and, with a powerful military at his back, was destined to conquer kingdom after kingdom. He had done as much in her second, third, fourth, and fifth lives. In her sixth, Rishe had faced him in battle herself and died by his hand.\nWe never had a chance. That war was lost before it began.\nArnold\u2019s brilliance lay not in his swordplay but in his skill as a tactician. He set countries up for conquest and knocked them down, swallowing them one by one.\nI know him, but he doesn\u2019t know me. We haven\u2019t met in this life. I need an excuse fast. \nRishe curtsied slowly. \u201cMy name is Rishe Irmgard Weitzner. We\u2019ve never been introduced, but I\u2019ve heard of you.\u201d\nArnold donned an amused smile. \u201cYou plant your weight like a trained swordswoman. Your center of gravity is perfect.\u201d\n\u201cYou exaggerate,\u201d Rishe demurred. \u201cThat was simply a curtsy to an esteemed guest.\u201d \n\u201cI must have misheard, but I swear you called me \u2018emperor\u2019 just now.\u201d \nRishe froze.\n\u201cMy father yet lives,\u201d Arnold said. \u201cI am simply a crown prince. Why would you call me that?\u201d \n\u201cUh, um\u2026\u201d Rishe floundered for an answer.\nShe\u2019d made such a foolish mistake. Arnold\u2019s gaze cut right through her. It felt like he\u2019d see through any lie she told right down to her soul. She remembered this from the battlefield\u2014how his attention alone felt like a sword thrust.\nBut why even bother to lie? They\u2019d never meet again, so who cared what he thought of her? Sure, she harbored a hard feeling or two over the recent slaying, but there was no point complaining about it to this Arnold. Calling him the emperor was boorish, but Rishe was in the process of being forcibly exiled. Why play at diplomacy?\nShe took a deep breath and bowed low. This was not the curtsy of a noble lady but of a servant bowing in supplication to her master.\n\u201cMy humblest apologies, Your Highness. I was in a rush. Such a rude slip of the tongue.\u201d She raised her head. \u201cMy ex-fianc\u00e9 just annulled our engagement, so I\u2019ve got a lot on my mind. If you would excuse me.\u201d \n\u201cHe annulled your engagement?\u201d\nAt that, Rishe turned and fled.\nThis unexpected run-in with Arnold had taken up valuable time. She threw open the door to the balcony and hiked up her skirts, kicking off her shoes in anticipation of jumping into a tree. Looking down, she realized the ground was far closer than she\u2019d feared.\nExcellent! I can just drop into the garden!\nArnold, who up until now had been rendered speechless, shook himself out of his fugue as Rishe clambered over the railing. \u201cHey!\u201d\nRishe\u2019s moonlight-silver dress flowed around her as she leapt. The lawn was soft, but the fall was still far enough to risk injury.\nWeight evenly distributed on the soles of my feet, roll to transfer the impact to my shins and thighs, then onto my hips and my back.\nShe landed safely, rolled nimbly in her dress, and popped back up. Her hair was covered in leaves. \nI need to hurry up!\nBracing against a nearby rock, she used her weight to snap the heels off of her shoes. There. That would make running a little easier. Satisfied, she slipped them back on and made haste toward the family estate. \n \n***\n \nUp on the balcony, Crown Prince Arnold of Galkhein watched the spectacle play out from beginning to end. He gazed at the girl with the coral hair. Her appearance was that of any young noblewoman, but she moved like a well-trained knight. She\u2019d leapt from the balcony and landed skillfully, showing no signs of distress at her ripped dress or disheveled hair. Instead, she\u2019d knocked the heels off her shoes and dashed away.\nAlso, she had called him an emperor.\nPlaying it all over again in his head, Arnold broke out into a rare chuckle. As his shoulders quivered with laughter, his attendant approached him from behind.\n\u201cThere you are, Your Highness. What are you doing out here? I\u2019m aware you don\u2019t desire a wife, but beginning the search would be wise\u2026 Er, Your Highness?\u201d The attendant\u2019s eyes flew wide. His bored and scowling master was laughing. \u201cDid something happen?\u201d\n\u201cOliver, ready my coach. Wait, no. That will take too much time. Bring me a horse.\u201d\n\u201cAt once, Your Highness. Might I ask why?\u201d\nArnold didn\u2019t respond\u2014he just grinned like a hungry wolf catching scent of his prey.\n \n***\n \nOnce outside the palace gates, Rishe threw herself into the waiting coach, shouting for the driver to make haste. She stopped it a few hundred yards from the manor and bid him farewell. \u201cI\u2019m leaving! Thanks for always being such a safe driver, Daniel!\u201d\nThe road to the manor was muddy from a morning rain shower. She knew from her second life that the coach would get stuck, resulting in a loss of valuable time. It was better to just get out and run. \n\u201cHuff, huff.\u201d Despite her last life\u2019s physical conditioning, this body had no stamina. She\u2019d need to try to get fitter faster this time around.\nRishe reached the end of the road",
    "query_text": ", and her heart promptly sank all the way to her feet. \u201cOh no.\u201d\nThe front door was thronged with people, all of them surrounding a carriage bearing the royal family\u2019s coat of arms.\nI need to get out of here.\nWhile she stood frozen in indecision, one of the knights doing crowd control shouted, \u201cYour Highness! I have eyes on Lady Rishe!\u201d\n\u201cGet out of my way!\u201d A familiar voice started up a bellow. \u201cLet me through! Rishe, how"

Who the hell are you, anyway?!\u201d\nDon\u2019t tell me Prince Dietrich doesn\u2019t recognize one of his personal guests.\nDietrich\u2019s interests did not lean toward diplomacy; he likely hadn\u2019t bothered to introduce himself to Arnold. Mary, for her part, seemed to grasp that Arnold wasn\u2019t ordinary. She stood up to defend Rishe, despite the tremble in her voice. In a better world, perhaps the two of them could have become friends.\n\u201cThat\u2019s your ex-fianc\u00e9?\u201d Arnold cocked a brow. \u201cHe\u2019s even worse than I imagined. Pathetic.\u201d\nDietrich flushed. \u201cI\u2019ll have your head!\u201d\n\u201cDietrich, I beg of you, contain yourself,\u201d Rishe said, then rounded on Arnold. \u201cAs for you, Your Highness\u2014you know who Dietrich is, and you know what speaking carelessly could mean. Are you trying to pick a fight?\u201d\n\u201cWhatever do you mean?\u201d Arnold\u2019s brows lifted high, making him the picture of innocence. \u201cBelieve me, Lady Rishe, every word I speak is chosen with extreme care.\u201d\nFinally realizing who Arnold was, Dietrich visibly paled. \u201cArnold? He\u2019s the crown prince of Galkhein?\u201d\nMary yelped. The knights stood down, shamefaced. The gossip-hungry neighbors who\u2019d gathered to witness a scandal play out drew back in fear.\n\u201cHe\u2019s the demon prince? The one who single-handedly destroyed a whole order of enemy knights?\u201d\n\u201cWatch your tongue, fool! Do you want him to do the same to you?\u201d\nThe two nations enjoyed peaceful relations, but Arnold remained the dreaded prince, heir to the throne of a former enemy. Current rumor wasn\u2019t as widespread as it would be in five years, but he was still regarded with distrust.\nThe onlookers stood rooted to the spot, too terrified to flee.\nWell, this has devolved into a full-fledged disaster.\nRishe heaved a frustrated sigh. \u201cPrince Arnold, to what do we owe this honor? Surely a crown prince would not draw his sword for a mere jest.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m here on business,\u201d Arnold said. \u201cBut first, I must beg forgiveness for my rudeness.\u201d\nHuh, what do you know? Once he became emperor, he\u2019d gladly behead any subject who so much as dared speak a word against him.\nI guess at nineteen he still knew how to apologize.\nIf that surprised her, Arnold\u2019s next act completely obliterated her sense of reality. \nWith a flourish, he fell to his knees. \n\u201cHuh?\u201d Is this actually happening? \nHe was a man destined for an imperial crown. A man who would stand at the head of a military powerhouse and spread his rule across continents.\nArnold, known for his frigid pride, knelt to the disgraced daughter of a duke.\nAnd not only that\u2014his head was bowed, looking nothing so much as a knight swearing allegiance to his lady. If it were anyone else, it would be a delightful, pious image. Instead, the assembled looked on in terrified awe.\nNot Rishe, though.\n\u201cWhat are you doing?\u201d she hissed. \u201cGet up!\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m apologizing for my baseless impertinence. Also, I\u2019m asking you\u2026\u201d He trailed off to take Rishe\u2019s hand, tugging her forward so forcefully she staggered. He gazed up at her.\nUgh. He\u2019s so beautiful. No matter how many times she looked at him, it didn\u2019t become any less disarming. Long eyelashes, arched brows, a noble nose. His bright blue eyes reminded her of the drift ice she\u2019d seen in a northern kingdom, gazing out from a ship in one of her past lives. She knew she was dwelling on this to buy time, even as the reality before her sank in.\n\u201c\u2026to become my wife.\u201d\nShe froze, unable to process the words. \u201cWhat?\u201d Rishe glanced around, desperately searching the faces of the crowd. They all seemed as stunned as she felt. She looked down at Arnold again. \u201cYour wife?\u201d \n\u201cYes, that\u2019s right.\u201d\n\u201cYou want me to become your wife?\u201d\n\u201cYes.\u201d\nRishe couldn\u2019t speak. This was truly happening. It was real. It clicked into place in her head, and she let out a strangled grunt.\nWhat is going on? Why is this happening?\nShock lapped at her, fuzzing at the corners of her vision. He wanted to marry her. Arnold wanted to marry Rishe. Her murderer wanted to marry her.\nWhy is he doing this? He must have some ulterior motive, a broader goal. But I have to give him an answer.\nThe onlookers were holding their breath as Rishe said flatly, \u201cI reject your proposal.\u201d\nArnold said nothing.\nShe had to reject him. She was going to live a long, peaceful, carefree life, damn it, and no one would stop her. And yet\u2026\nArnold began to laugh, and the deep, creeping sense of dread inside Rishe only grew. Why does he seem so amused by this?!\n \n***\n \nHer previous life was her sixth. Disguised as a man, Rishe rose as a warrior of an island country she came upon in her travels. It was a conventional yet charming kingdom formed of red brick. After striking up a friendship with a group of knights who didn\u2019t realize she was a woman, Rishe followed their advice and joined them.\nThe training was grueling enough to make her wish she were dead. Back when she had lived as a noble, she\u2019d learned how to wield a sword for basic self-defense, but training as a noble lady had in no way prepared her for this. She drilled relentlessly, barely taking the time to sleep. Just as she became a full-fledged knight, Emperor Arnold\u2019s forces lay siege to the castle.\n \n***\n \nHow could this happen? \nIn her seventh life, Rishe wearily sank into her chair. Across from her sat Arnold, his legs crossed and chin propped up on his hand, watching her lazily.\n\u201cWhat\u2019s the matter?\u201d he asked. \u201cYou seem unhappy.\u201d\n\u201cYou could say that.\u201d Even her voice was grumpy. Still, she couldn\u2019t very well tell him it was because she bore a grudge from a previous life. After the first time her life rewound to that pivotal moment, she\u2019d resolved to keep her loops a secret. \u201cI had plans for my exile. A brand-new life. And now because of you, my parents are involved. Even the king has heard about it!\u201d\nAfter Rishe rejected Arnold, Dietrich had immediately cried out, \u201cTh-the crown prince of Galkhein proposed to Rishe?!\u201d\nHis shrieks were loud enough to attract the attention of the master and mistress of the manor.\nWhen her parents came out, Rishe had protested, \u201cI\u2019m not going to marry him! I\u2019m leaving the country just as Dietrich commanded.\u201d\nNo one listened. Their faces just paled with nervous confusion.\nJust then, a glittering coach arrived. Half-stuck in the mud, the man inside it was forced to trudge over the swampy ground, and so the king of Hermity himself arrived, staggering and dirt-stained. \nHe grabbed hold of his son\u2019s collar, pushing him into a low bow. He then turned to Prince Arnold and said, rather loudly, \u201cYour Highness! Allow me to apologize for my son\u2019s foolishness! You are an esteemed guest all the way from Galkhein! It is unthinkable he would not offer you the courtesy you are due!\u201d\n\u201cYou\u2019re hurting me, Father! My back!\u201d\nThe king then turned to Rishe. \u201cMy lady, allow me to sincerely apologize as both a king and a father. My son\u2019s behavior toward you has been utterly disgraceful. I beg you to please give Prince Arnold\u2019s proposal due consideration. Not only for your own sake but for the sake of your country.\u201d\nThe king bowed to her as deeply as his son had to Arnold, and her parents joined him. Rishe felt dizzy at the sight of this abject debasement in the presence of citizens.\nArnold, who had been watching the proceedings with a detached amusement, sobered and stepped toward the king. \u201cYour Majesty, please rise.\u201d\nWithout the smirk, Arnold\u2019s face immediately reverted to its cold mask. The king didn\u2019t move. Maybe something in Arnold\u2019s voice kept him frozen.\n\u201cSuch a trifle won\u2019t cause discord between our kingdoms,\u201d he went on. \u201cHowever, I would beg a little time to speak with Lady Rishe.\u201d\nLater, Rishe would learn that Arnold\u2019s attendant had spoken to the king\u2019s own gentleman, certain that his words would reach their target. \u201cMy master took such trouble to attend these festivities, and this is the welcome he is offered? I wonder, what will the emperor think when he learns of his son\u2019s slighting at your nation\u2019s hands?\u201d\n\u201cIf you would, Lady Rishe?\u201d The plump king looked to be on the verge of tears.\nRishe had no obligation to accept and no desire to spend a moment longer in this country than was absolutely necessary. But acquiescence seemed the fastest way to move things along.\nAs her mind whirled, Arnold leaned in to whisper, \u201cIf you refuse to hear my suit, you won\u2019t deter me. I\u2019ll simply move on to Plan B.\u201d\nAnd that was how she found herself in one of the palace\u2019s parlors, here to \u201cjust talk\u201d to Prince Arnold. The ball guests were all gone. It was just the two of them.\n\u201cI want to know what you\u2019re planning,\u201d Rishe said flatly.\n\u201cPlanning? Me?\u201d\n\u201cBy asking me to marry you. You don\u2019t know me. A proposal like this wouldn\u2019t come out of the blue.\u201d\nThis man was destined to become an aggressive warmonger over the next few years. He wouldn\u2019t do anything without a dozen motives.\nPrince Arnold just smiled. \u201cI have no plans. I\u2019m simply enamored with you.\u201d\n\u201cEnamored\u2026?\u201d\nThat was the last thing she\u2019d expected him to say. Asking him to elaborate didn\u2019t seem worth the breath\u2014he was obviously lying. As if this ruthless, inhuman creature with ice in his veins could feel even a flicker of affection.\n\u201cWhy refuse me?\u201d Arnold asked. \u201cYour engagement is broken, you\u2019re on the verge of exile, and you have no faction or supporters. At this rate, you\u2019ll be dead within a fortnight. I\u2019d call my offer a stroke of unbelievable fortune.\u201d\n\u201cYou\u2019re not wrong,\u201d Rishe admitted. \u201cOnce upon a time, I would have jumped at your offer.\u201d\nIf it had been made in her first life, for instance. But now Rishe knew better. Her life was only just getting started, and the future held endless possibilities. After the horror of her sixth loop, she yearned for freedom.\nI don\u2019t want to marry him. I won\u2019t be anyone\u2019s captive. Still\u2026\nRishe, more than anyone, knew that the slightest adjustment could enact profound changes on the trajectory of a life. No doubt she\u2019d have many more lives, but this could be the only one where marriage to Arnold would be an option.\nThe dread emperor. The tyrant. The man who will stoke the fires of war. \nRishe knew the gossip, the endless conjecture behind Arnold Hein\u2019s bloody reign, but she didn\u2019t know the truth.\nWhy? The question had haunted her since her first life. She\u2019d never before had the chance to even speak to him.\nShe had wondered it as a merchant, hearing of the distant outbreak of war. She\u2019d wondered when the news of the dead and dying reached her apothecary. When she had comforted her terrified mistress in her life as a maid, assuring her everything would be all right. When she squared off against him in battle, as he plunged a sword through her heart\u2014even then she wondered. \nIf I stick around, maybe I\u2019ll finally have my answer. Half of her was dying to know. The other half didn\u2019t give a damn. And yet\u2026\nShe recalled a childhood dream. Rather, a longing.\nRishe let out a breath. \u201cYou claim you are enamored with me.\u201d\n\u201cYes. I am completely under your spell.\u201d\nTo think he could spout such nonsense with a straight face!\n\u201cThen will you grant me anything I desire?\u201d\n\u201cSo long as it is within my power,\u201d Arnold said. \u201cAnything you want will be yours.\u201d\nRishe hesitated, gathering her thoughts. \u201cI have some conditions.\u201d Arnold silently motioned for her to go on. \u201cI want full control over the wedding festivities. Everything must be procured through merchants of my choosing.\u201d\n\u201cFine.\u201d Arnold nodded. \u201cYou\u2019re free to do business with whomever you wish.\u201d\n\u201cAfter we are married, I must be in a position to mingle with guests from abroad.\u201d\n\u201cThat sounds within the purview of the crown princess. Anything else?\u201d\n\u201cI will be allowed to live in a separate residence from your mother and father.\u201d\nShe meant this seriously, but it made Arnold laugh. \u201cYou don\u2019t seem the type to worry about an overbearing mother-in-law.\u201d\n\u201cYou would be surprised. Combative relationships with one\u2019s new family are the most difficult part of marriage, or so they say. It could be a ramshackle cottage for all I care\u2014I just require a secondary residence.\u201d\nActually, Rishe didn\u2019t care at all about in-laws. When Arnold set his war into motion, his first move would be the assassination of his father. A genuine coup by patricide, not at all like Dietrich\u2019s clumsy attempt. Next, he would name himself emperor, take control of the country, and mobilize the military.\nSeparating him from his parents will make the first step more difficult\u2014although not impossible, unfortunately.\n\u201cAnything else?\u201d Arnold asked. \u201cI\u2019ll do whatever it takes to marry you.\u201d\n\u201cIdeally, I\u2019d like to know your endgame,\u201d Rishe said with dignity. \u201cBut as I doubt there\u2019s any chance of that, I have one final request.\u201d She jabbed a finger into his face, regardless of how rude it was. \u201cI will spend my time idling around the castle. No work, no study. I shall be utterly useless.\u201d\nLet\u2019s see just how much you want me as your princess.\nAfter a long moment of silence, Arnold cracked a merry laugh. The proposal remained; all her conditions were met.\n\n(2) chapter number given is likely out of range: 0\nChapter: 7\n\nChapter 2\nChapter 2\n \n\u201cYOU KNOW, it was only after I went into commerce that I truly had a dream for the future,\u201d Rishe had once conf",

But now, for the first time, I actually have a goal of my own.\u201d\n\u201cOh, yeah?\u201d her friend said. He was the ruler of the desert kingdom, and his smile was awfully charming. \u201cWhat\u2019s that?\u201d\nRishe smiled back. \u201cI want to travel to every single country in the world. I want to see everything in every town, peruse their markets, and meet the eyes of every person who lives"

    "prefix_text": " the bandits. \u201cHow did you get out of the coach?\u201d\nRishe shrugged. \u201cIf I tell you, you\u2019ll be able to prevent me from doing it again.\u201d\nArnold snickered. \u201cYou continue to amaze me.\u201d\nHow can you go from ice-cold to suddenly looking like a normal nineteen-year-old? It\u2019s disconcerting. \nRishe fought down her disquiet as a man alighted from a coach and shouted, \u201cYour Highness! Not again!\u201d He was Oliver, one of the prince\u2019s attendants. He had silver hair and was roughly as tall as Arnold.\n\u201cWhat do you think all these knights are for, decoration? Why do you insist on endangering yourself?\u201d\nRishe had only met Oliver briefly a few days ago, but he didn\u2019t appear to be intimidated by Arnold at all. And, well\u2026he\u2019s not wrong.\nShe feared the menace would return to Arnold\u2019s expression, but he just looked annoyed. \u201cI could tell they were prepared to kill. I\u2019d prefer to take the burden on myself than risk multiple injuries so far afield. And we already have casualties.\u201d\nHe was right. Several injured knights leaned listlessly among the trees. Arnold issued orders to those still able-bodied. \u201cFirst squad, see to the wounded. Second squad, arrest these men.\u201d\n\u201cYes, sir!\u201d\nOliver appeared unsatisfied. \u201cYour Highness, that is a weak justification. I\u2019m overjoyed you\u2019re well, but you must consider Lady Rishe. Perhaps next time we run into a team of murderous brigands, you could allow your consort to remain in the coach.\u201d\n\u201cI told her to remain in the coach!\u201d\nRishe quickly averted her gaze, turning her attention to the wounded knights. They didn\u2019t appear badly injured, yet they all seemed exhausted.\n\u201cExcuse me, can I take a look?\u201d Rishe approached the knight acting as a medic. He looked round, startled by her presence.\n\u201cNonsense, my lady. Don\u2019t trouble yourself, you must have had quite a scare.\u201d\nThis was not unreasonable, but the wariness in his eyes made it clear he wanted her nowhere near his comrade. He isn\u2019t just being polite. He truly is on guard. \nBeside them, an injured knight groaned as another helped him up. \u201cWhat\u2019s wrong with you?\u201d the second knight asked the first. \n\u201cI-I feel\u2026numb.\u201d\n\u201cWhat? Damn.\u201d The knight grabbed up one of the fallen bandit\u2019s swords, going pale as he inspected the blade. \u201cYour Highness, look at this. Poison.\u201d\nArnold clicked his tongue. \u201cLocate every laceration and bind them close to the heart. Suck the poison from the wounds.\u201d\nHe mostly got that right, at least. In the meantime, Rishe located the nearest bound bandit and pulled his dagger out of its sheath. Its wet coating gleamed in the sunlight, just as the knight had said.\nThey applied the poison liberally\u2014whatever it is must be cheap and easily bought in bulk.\nShe wafted the smell toward her, bracing for something rancid, but detected nothing. Then she brought it closer to her nose.\nIt smells sweet, like an overripe apple. Shea grass and\u2026bluecap mushrooms. All the knights appear to have the same symptoms, so I won\u2019t have to check every blade.\nRishe stood back up and headed for the coach.\nOliver took a step after her. \u201cYour Highness, Lady Rishe is\u2014\u201d\n\u201cLeave her. She may do as she pleases.\u201d\n\u201cShe\u2019s well trained,\u201d Oliver mused. \u201cBut a battlefield is no place for a young lady. She probably wasn\u2019t prepared for such a dreadful spectacle.\u201d\nRishe ignored the murmurs and focused on her work. There they are. I\u2019ll take these, these, and\u2026\n\u201cThe poison must be a sleeping drug,\u201d she overheard Arnold saying. \u201cHunters use such drugs to weaken larger prey. I doubt this dose is lethal.\u201d\n\u201cBut it certainly is annoying,\u201d replied Oliver. \u201cWe\u2019re still two days out from Galkhein. Lugging a company of sleeping men in armor won\u2019t be pleasant.\u201d\n\u201cWe\u2019ll have to stop somewhere nearby. A hunter\u2019s settlement. Perhaps they will have an antidote\u2014\u201d\n\u201cExcuse me.\u201d Rishe, who\u2019d returned from the carriage, raised a hand. \u201cI have an antidote.\u201d\n\u201cWhat?\u201d\nThe entire company stared at her in awe.\n \n***\n \nAs it turned out, Arnold\u2019s guess was right. \nThis sweet-smelling substance was a hunter\u2019s drug, made from ingredients that were only toxic in their raw form. Heat rendered them harmless. Rishe had encountered this poison several times before, curing a customer afflicted with it during her life as an apothecary.\n\u201cA lethal dose for a grown man would fill a wine glass. They likely got less than a hundredth of that,\u201d Rishe explained to Arnold, not looking up from her work. \u201cStill, the numbness can block their airways with the roots of their tongues. It\u2019s best to lay them on their sides.\u201d\n\u201cYes, I understand the theory and the solution.\u201d Arnold gazed down at Rishe\u2019s hands. \u201cThe part I\u2019m struggling with is why you\u2019re the one telling me this.\u201d\n\u201cWell, I know how to make the antidote,\u201d Rishe said patiently as she muddled the herbs together in the white soup bowl she\u2019d borrowed for her flowers. She crushed them with the back of a spoon before adding another dried flower, crushing that as well, and combining them to form a paste. This process would be easier with a pestle, but she wasn\u2019t about to complain. \u201cThis poison is common\u2014it\u2019s cheap and easy to make, which often means the antidote is simple as well.\u201d\nThe antidote was synthesized, in fact, when hunters witnessed a deer showing no symptoms after eating a certain mushroom. They tested those along with other common herbs the deer ate. Rishe mentally thanked them for their scientific rigor as she added a bit of water, straining it all through a cloth.\nRishe stood up, brandishing the bowl of bright green medicine. \u201cBoiling would make the antidote more potent, but this works in a pinch.\u201d\nThat was when she noticed the astonished stares. Unsure of what social faux paus she\u2019d perpetrated, she looked away. Oliver was completely stunned. Arnold looked thoughtful. It was imperative the knights were treated as soon as possible, but to Rishe\u2019s dismay, no one was moving. \nDo they not trust me? That makes sense. Anyone would be reluctant to use medicine concocted by a complete stranger. But the longer we wait, the harder the poison will become to cure. \nShe needed to dispel their doubts. Rolling up her sleeve, Rishe approached Arnold and drew his sword from its scabbard. \u201cI need to borrow this for a moment, Your Highness.\u201d\n\u201cWhat are you\u2014\u201d\nShe pushed the blade against the soft skin of her inner arm. Blood welled up, along with the sharp sting of pain. Nothing compared to her injuries sustained during her life as a knight, though.\nArnold did not share her nonchalance. \u201cWhat do you think you\u2019re doing?!\u201d\nHe grabbed for her arm. She stepped out of his grasp. Was blood truly so shocking? She didn\u2019t have the time to worry about it. Clutching the overfull bowl, Rishe hurried back to the knights.\n\u201cDon\u2019t worry. This isn\u2019t poison,\u201d Rishe said. She demonstrated as much by drizzling it with a spoon over her own fresh wound. It stung. That meant the ingredients were working.\n\u201cThis is crushed liquori grass, luqua flowers, and carilya nuts. I\u2019ll swallow some if that\u2019s what it takes to prove it\u2019s safe.\u201d It was horribly bitter; she hoped it wouldn\u2019t come to that. \u201cThe paralysis will last for days. Please make up your mind quickly.\u201d\n\u201cMake up our mind?\u201d\n\u201cWill you allow me to cure the poison? Or would you rather drag paralyzed soldiers all the way to Galkhein? I suppose you could waste His Highness\u2019s time searching for a hunter\u2019s settlement to use their antidote.\u201d She smiled serenely. \u201cIt makes no difference to us. Right, Your Highness?\u201d\nIn the end, Rishe applied the antidote.\nThe recovery took a few hours. While they waited, Rishe picked herbs in the same meadow she\u2019d been gazing at with yearning from the carriage. A fortuitous turn of events. She found anti-inflammatory herbs and flowers to ease sour bellies, ingredients for curing headaches, and mushrooms for inducing slumber. She wrapped them all up in a handkerchief.\nIn the meantime, Arnold dispatched a messenger to this region\u2019s lord, making arrangements to deliver the apprehended bandits. After coordinating with Oliver, he drifted over to Rishe.\n\u201cI see your interest in flowers is mercenary, rather than ornamental,\u201d he said, surveying the heaps of herbs gathered on the bank of the pond. He sat down beside her.\nWhen he didn\u2019t say anything more, Rishe went back to work plucking leaves from plants with valuable stems. The leaves had no medicinal effects, but they did make a decent broth. Slumber mushroom spores were a nuisance unless dried; they were spread out beside her in the sun.\nI wonder, would he be annoyed if I attached herbs to the roof of the coach? That would be unusual adornment for a crown prince\u2019s retinue, but it wouldn\u2019t hurt to ask.\nShe realized, quite suddenly, that Arnold was looking at her. At her hands, specifically. He sat cross-legged with his chin propped on his fist, staring absently, like a kid watching a column of ants march by.\nWhat is so fascinating about herbs?\nTheir eyes met. \u201cAm I bothering you?\u201d he asked.\nRishe shook her head slowly. \u201cNot at all. I was just curious what caught your eye.\u201d\n\u201cNothing specific. I was just thinking how very unusual you are.\u201d He was smiling again. \u201cI\u2019m looking forward to how you\u2019ll surprise me next.\u201d\nLike I\u2019m some sort of rare pet he bought to entertain him. She didn\u2019t like that. Nothing she\u2019d done was at all remarkable\u2014normal tasks performed by a normal person.\n\u201cI didn\u2019t make that antidote for your amusement.\u201d\n\u201cI realize that.\u201d The instigating smile faded from his lips. \u201cYou know, those knights you coerced into taking your home-brewed medicine were all born in the slums.\u201d\n\u201cCoerced? That\u2019s hardly the word I\u2019d use.\u201d\n\u201cGalkhein claims to value merit above all else, but in the end, people are judged by where they came from. Despite this, those men fought their way up from nothing.\u201d\nRishe paused in plucking the seeds from a flower and looked up at Arnold.\n\u201cThe men with the worst cases of the paralysis were all newly assigned. They\u2019ve spent weeks training to ensure this mission was a success. That older knight\u2014the one who bowed to you\u2014sustained an injury protecting the rookies. He cares deeply about his men.\u201d\n\u201cYou seem to care about them too,\u201d Rishe commented.\n\u201cI handpicked them for my retinue.\u201d Arnold clambered to his feet, only to fall into a bow. \u201cAnd you kept them safe. You have my deepest gratitude.\u201d\nRishe found herself at a loss for words. Was this Arnold putting on a mask to hide the monster within? Or was this the real him? She remembered the way he\u2019d looked when he held his blade to the bandit\u2019s throat, like a child poised to break a toy he had grown bored of.\n\u201cDon\u2019t mention it,\u201d Rishe said, uncomfortable. \u201cI knew how to do it, so I did.\u201d\nArnold laughed softly. \u201cBe that as it may, I\u2019d still count a noblewoman who can brew remedies from wildflowers by the side of the road a rare find.\u201d\n\u201cEarlier, when you grabbed my wrist\u2026\u201d Rishe steered the subject away from her incongruous knowledge. \u201cYou broke your promise. You said you wouldn\u2019t touch me.\u201d\n\u201cThat was reflex,\u201d Arnold protested. \u201cI thought you were going to hurt yourself.\u201d\nSuch a simple conversation, so casual. It had Rishe feeling positively peculiar.\n\u201cWhy are your knights so wary around me?\u201d she asked. \n\u201cWary? Oh, they were all at the palace when you broke your first engagement. They\u2019re most likely concerned I\u2019m bringing home a villainous jilt who will lead to my ruin. Something silly like that.\u201d\n\u201cI see.\u201d Apparently, being dumped by a prince called into question one\u2019s herbalist abilities.\n\u201cI\u2019m glad you mentioned it,\u201d Arnold went on, \u201cbecause there may be people in Galkhein who will oppose our union. I will do everything in my power to protect you, but you must bring any insults or threats to me right away.\u201d\n\u201cAre there likely to be many?\u201d\n\u201cIn theory, the crown prince may choose his own wife, but the done thing is, of course, to marry a princess. I assume a duke\u2019s daughter would have at least some ties to the royal family?\u201d\nHe assumed correctly. She was in the family tree, if a rather distant branch.\n\u201cMy father has ordered me to choose a bride from a different kingdom rather than a woman of my own land because\u2014\u201d\n\u201cOne never knows when a hostage will come in handy,\u201d Rishe finished for him.\nGalkhein was an expansionist empire. Currently, peace reigned\u2014but peace was precarious. If Galkhein demanded any of the countries to hand over a princess bride, then none were in a position to refuse. With his daughter in the hands of a foreign power, no king would dare oppose a war that power cared to wage.\n\u201cI sent a message to my father telling him I happened upon a close relation of Hermity\u2019s king\u2014a duke\u2019s daughter who had been recently tossed aside by her fianc\u00e9e,\u201d Arnold said. \u201cI also may have implied I was the reason for your falling out\u2014yours and the prince\u2019s. Why, when I saw a woman so powerful and connected and beloved, I couldn\u2019t help but plunder you.\u201d\n\u201cPlunder me? That\u2019s certainly one way to describe it.\u201d Dietrich had kicked up an almighty fuss, despite being the one who broke the engagement.\n\u201cMy father approves of you because he sees you as a bargaining chip. There will be others who aren\u2019t prepared to accept you so willingly.\u201d\n\u201cIs that so?\u201d Rishe said steadily.\n\u201cNever fear,\u201d Arnold responded. \u201cThey\u2019ll eat their words, every one of them. They will receive you as their crown princess if they value their\u2014\u201d\n\u201cNo, being a hostage is perfect.\u201d \nArnold stared at her. \u201cHm?\u201d\n\u201cAs a hostage, I\u2019ll have no official duties, will I? We can pretend I\u2019m here only under great duress, and there will be no need for my comment on governmental or diplomatic affairs.\u201d\nArnold hesitated. \u201cI suppose not.\u201d\n\u201cExcellent! Then I can live my dream of being utterly useless.\u201d Rishe trembled with delight. The thought of acting as an ambassador had really been weighing on her mind. Being a princess was nonstop work. Having been groomed for the position from an early age, Rishe knew members of the royal family barely even had time to sleep.\nBut prisoners didn\u2019t have places in government.\n\u201cThis is such a weight off my mind,\u201d Rishe admitted. \u201cThank you so much for keeping your promise, Your Highness.\u201d\n\u201cEr, of course.\u201d\n\u201cBut don\u2019t worry, I won\u2019t shirk my duties as wedding planner.\u201d Nearly ready to collapse with relief, Rishe returned to her herbs.\n \n***\n \nAfter the bandit incident, Rishe felt the knights begin to ease a bit in her presence.\nDespite their initial reluctance to accept her help, they continued to report the injured men\u2019s progress and bring any concerns directly to her. In return, they took over gathering herbs from the surrounding countryside on their rest stops.\n",
    "query_text": "She hadn\u2019t done it for gratitude, but she was nonetheless touched. Gathering medicinal herbs had been second nature ever since her life as an apothecary, and it was foolish to ever turn down loyalty.\nSeveral days after the altercation with the bandits, the coach train finally arrived in the imperial capital of Galkhein.\n\u201cOh my,\u201d Rishe murmured as they passed through the gates.\nWhite stone buildings stood in straight rows, lining clean, orderly streets. The first stories all appeared to be shops, while the second-floor windows were festooned with flowers. Everywhere she looked were smiling faces, citizens turned out to witness their prince\u2019s return over the smooth brick roads. Overlooking it all was the towering magnificence of the imperial palace.\n\u201cThe capital is the seat"

Although if I\u2019m just a hostage, that doesn\u2019t surprise me.\nShe hoped she got to meet the current emperor at least once. The future Arnold\u2019s violent conquest only began after he killed the man and made himself emperor, after all.\nI wonder what happened to Arnold Hein after I died in my past life. Did he reign supreme after winning his war? Or did some country manage to put a stop to his conquest? Whatever the case, I absolutely cannot allow him to start a conflict this time. Being the empress of a wartime nation sounds like so much work! The very thought is unacceptable!\nPerhaps they could divorce, but Rishe had a feeling that if Arnold decided to discard her in the middle of a war, she would fail in her mission to make it past the age of twenty. Better to avoid the situation all together.\nWait. When she thought about it, the cause of every single one of Rishe\u2019s deaths was Arnold and his war. I died fighting. I died when Galkhein\u2019s army invaded\u2026\nLooking at her six lives, all of them had ended in more or less the same way.\nRishe found herself crouched on the ground, cradling her head in her hands. Maybe we should get a divorce right now. But it wasn\u2019t in Rishe\u2019s nature to take back her decisions once she\u2019d made them. \nIf I leave, I\u2019ll probably just die in some war-related disaster again. If I can\u2019t live apart from him, I should take this opportunity to learn everything that I can. \nRishe didn\u2019t know the cause of her repeating lives, but there was no guarantee that the loops were infinite. She had to operate under the possibility that this life could be her last. This required some thought, but standing around seething with anxiety wouldn\u2019t help.\nRight now I\u2019ll focus on cleaning. Once the bath is here, I\u2019ll scrub off all the dust and travel exhaustion. And then I can finally relax! \nBrimming with new determination, she stood up and headed for the well. She was forestalled by the sound of jeering giggles. \n\u201cAww, look at the new girl, trying so hard,\u201d said one voice.\n\u201cAll the enthusiasm in the world won\u2019t make a difference,\u201d said another. \u201cWe\u2019re going to be the crown princess\u2019s maids, not you.\u201d\nThe first added, \u201cHey, are you even listening? Stop wasting your time!\u201d\nRishe heard a weak scream, followed by a thump, like a body hitting the ground. She broke into a run, finding a blonde girl sprawled in the dirt, surrounded by four other women.\n\u201cAre you all right?\u201d Rishe hurried over to help the girl up. Her maid\u2019s uniform\u2014a loose navy-blue dress with a white apron\u2014was smeared with mud. The others were dressed identically.\n\u201cWho are you?\u201d one of the girls snapped at Rishe. She had a mop of blazing-red hair. \u201cAnother newbie?\u201d\nAn understandable mistake. Rishe\u2019s dress was simple, free of ornamentation, and her hair was bound back in a ponytail to keep it out of the way. She was dust-streaked, sweaty, and carrying a bucket in her arms.\nTelling them who I am will be more trouble than it\u2019s worth. Her silence only angered the girls more.\n\u201cAre you one of the crown princess\u2019s maids? They\u2019ve been snatching up every new girl. Those pretty hands of yours don\u2019t look like they\u2019ve ever held a broom,\u201d said one of them.\n\u201cUnfortunately for you, we\u2019ve been working here three years, and we\u2019ll be the ones to serve Prince Arnold as the maids of his palace.\u201d\n\u201cCan you stand? Oh, good, it looks like you\u2019re not injured.\u201d Rishe helped the girl up out of the dirt. \n\u201cHey, don\u2019t ignore us!\u201d the redheaded maid shouted. \u201cYou\u2019ve got some nerve. If you want to make it here, you\u2019ll know your place! I doubt the two of you will last a week!\u201d\nRishe didn\u2019t respond, her attention snagging on something else. The redhead was carrying curtains, probably to bring them to the wash. Rishe stared at them so hard the maid began to shift uncomfortably. \u201cWhat\u2019s your problem?\u201d\n\u201cYou should wait to wash those,\u201d Rishe said.\nThe girl glared daggers at her. \u201cExcuse me? Are you telling me it\u2019s too late in the day? You really are an amateur! The light lasts longer in the spring, you know. And it\u2019s hot today. There\u2019ll be plenty of\u2014\u201d \n\u201cIt\u2019s going to rain, is all.\u201d\nThe maids exchanged glances. \u201cHow can you be so sure?\u201d\n\u201cLook at the clouds amassing. The butterflies and the bees are flying low. The moisture in the air will make the drying take longer.\u201d\n\u201cWhat?\u201d\nAnother maid spoke up in a soft voice. \u201cDiana, you were the one who said we should take the initiative to wash the bigger pieces. You said the crown prince would choose us for his household!\u201d\n\u201cStop putting the blame on me! This isn\u2019t my fault.\u201d An indignant flush crept over the redhead\u2019s face. \u201cThere\u2019s no way some upstart can tell what time it\u2019s going to rain! The weather is going to be fantastic all day. Come on, we\u2019re hauling these over to the wash!\u201d\nThe three girls meekly followed Diana.\nRishe sighed, turning to the blonde girl. \u201cAre you hurt?\u201d\n\u201cNo, I\u2019m fine.\u201d The girl\u2019s gaze darted around nervously. \u201cI\u2019m Elsie. Thank you for helping me.\u201d Her face was studiously blank, but from the way she struggled with her words, Rishe could tell she was being genuine.\n\u201cDon\u2019t worry about it,\u201d Rishe said. \u201cYour uniform seems to have fared less well.\u201d\n\u201cOh no.\u201d Elsie looked down at herself. Her face remained vacant, but she seemed sad. \u201cAnd I just got it.\u201d \n\u201cYou can get the dirt out if you wash it straight away. It\u2019s going to rain, but this dress should dry quickly. Use lots of soap, but don\u2019t scrub it by hand\u2014scrape the mud off with a brush.\u201d\n\u201cWhy a brush?\u201d\n\u201cBecause your fingers will just grind dirt into the threads. A brush is more porous.\u201d\nThe young sons of the family Rishe served spent their time tumbling in the dirt, and she had plenty of experience scraping mud out of clothes. She could even salvage dirty socks that had spent days crumpled in the corner.\n\u201cDo you\u2026 Are you\u2026\u201d Elsie trailed off, blinking rapidly a couple of times before finally looking Rishe in the eyes. \u201cAre you the crown princess\u2019s maid?\u201d\nUnsure how to answer, Rishe couldn\u2019t meet her eyes.\n \n***\n \nAfter parting ways with Elsie, Rishe returned to the detached wing with her fresh water. She put clean sheets on the bed the knights had installed, satisfied that she had a comfortable place to sleep. This room also had the highest-up balcony in the whole detached palace.\nTaking a break, she wandered out onto the balcony and looked off over the capital, the golden afternoon tinged with the onset of twilight. The day was fresh with a recent rain, the air clear enough to see for miles. The spring breeze felt good against her skin, sweaty from cleaning. Rishe leaned against the railing, leaning her head back and closing her eyes.\nShe felt like collapsing into bed immediately, but she desperately needed a wash. Still, she didn\u2019t want to pull herself away from the view and the breeze just yet. When she resumed gazing out absentmindedly, something her mother once said drifted back to her. \n\u201cRishe, there is no need for you to think for yourself.\u201d\nShe frowned, the memories coming thick and fast now.\n\u201cYou mustn\u2019t forget that the duty of our family is to live our lives fully devoted to the kings of the land. You\u2019re smart, but all the thinking in the world won\u2019t do a woman any good. You need only concern yourself with how best to serve the crown prince.\u201d\n\u201cStudies? Focus on social etiquette\u2014that\u2019s what you need for navigating high society. The crown prince\u2019s bride must be flawless. Your smile is lacking. You must always strive to appear amiable.\u201d\nRishe breathed out a long sigh. When I was fifteen, their lectures were the only thing I thought about.\nHer parents preached constantly. \u201cA woman\u2019s true happiness is to marry a suitable man and give birth to his heirs.\u201d\n\u201cBut, Mother\u2026\u201d\nObjection was not permitted. Any argument was immediately dispensed with. As a woman, Rishe could not inherit her father\u2019s title. Her only value was in her marriage. \nDespite knowing now that the opinions of others were as worthless as empty titles, the words still echoed in her memories.\nRishe\u2019s fingertips twitched, and she opened her eyes. Unmoving, she said, \u201cShouldn\u2019t you be seeing to your duties?\u201d\n\u201cMore hidden depths, I see,\u201d came a voice tinged with pleasure. Rishe straightened and turned. There was Arnold, leaning against the door to the balcony. \u201cYou seem able to sense my approach no matter how far or how hard I try.\u201d\n\u201cYou\u2019re quite naughty, aren\u2019t you? You\u2019ve been making your presence known little by little, emanating threat, to see how quickly I catch on.\u201d\n\u201cSo you noticed that as well.\u201d Arnold joined Rishe on the balcony. She tensed, but all he did was cast a curious glance at the view. \u201cWhat were you looking at?\u201d\n\u201cThe city.\u201d Rishe was hardly going to tell him she\u2019d been looking at nothing, merely ruminating on her mother\u2019s overbearing advice. The view from the balcony was spectacular, though. \u201cWhat\u2019s that over there?\u201d\n\u201cYou mean the library? The state invested funds to expand it. We have books from all over the world.\u201d\n\u201cReally? You have a library that big?\u201d Rishe\u2019s eyes sparkled with delight. She pointed out another building. \u201cWhat about that spire? It\u2019s beautiful.\u201d\n\u201cThe church and clock tower. The bells ring out the hour.\u201d\n\u201cOoh, how wonderful! And it looks like there\u2019s a rather big market there too?\u201d\n\u201cYes, the largest market in the city. Carts line up in the early morning. Most of the offerings are made fresh every day.\u201d\n\u201cAmazing! And what about that pretty mountain over there?\u201d\nRishe tried and failed to contain her excitement. She couldn\u2019t help but imagine what seeing all these places up close would be like. The grand library, the beautiful church that told the time, and the morning market with fresh, delicious food\u2014she wanted to experience it all.\nSeeing Arnold\u2019s bemused face, she said, \u201cWhat?\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m just wondering where all this interest is coming from,\u201d he said. \u201cYou were so reluctant to come, yet here you are, brimming with curiosity for my city.\u201d\n\u201cWell\u2026\u201d she trailed off, unsure of how to respond.\nWhat should I say? Should I just tell him the truth?\nThis wasn\u2019t a secret, but talking about her hopes and dreams to the man who had killed her was a little awkward. A strange self-consciousness settled on her, her cheeks heating as she mumbled, \u201cBecause I\u2019ve always wanted to.\u201d\nArnold looked at her keenly. \u201cWanted to what?\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019ve always wanted to come here.\u201d\nDuring her life as a merchant, Rishe developed her single dream to visit everywhere in the world. That dream was",
    "query_text": " cut tragically short when only one country remained: Galkhein.\nIn each of her consecutive lives, Rishe\u2019s priority became staying alive. Every time, without fail, just as she found her footing, the world was plunged into chaos. She never had the chance to see Galkhein. This betrothal was her chance. \u201cIt\u2019s probably why I agreed to marry you,\u201d she added after a moment\u2019s hesitation.\nArnold swept a tepid glance over the city. \u201cThere\u2019s nothing here worth seeing.\u201d\n\u201cThat\u2019s not true! The places you just told me about sound amazing! Your citizens are clean and happy, your knights are proper and kind. Oh, and another\u2014\u201d"

I\u2019ll put finding you a maid at the top of my to-do list.\u201d\n\u201cNo need.\u201d Rishe smiled. \u201cI can prepare for the party on my own.\u201d\nThis maid-selection process made Rishe uneasy. After witnessing that exchange between the servants in the garden, she imagined quarrels breaking out all through the palace. And she doubted the disputes would go away even after they decided.\nOliver frowned. \u201cBut won\u2019t dressing be difficult without a lady\u2019s maid?\u201d \nShe shook her head. \u201cI can do my hair and put on a gown by myself. I brought dresses and cosmetics from home. Don\u2019t worry.\u201d\nRishe ignored Oliver\u2019s stunned look, already reevaluating her cleaning plans.\n \n***\n \nThe first thing Rishe said to Arnold that night was, \u201cYour Highness, I have a request.\u201d Her gown rustled as she leaned in close. \u201cI would like some herb seed and a corner of the gardens. I made a list. I hope we can discuss this in more detail later.\u201d\nArnold was silent a moment. \u201cRishe.\u201d\n\u201cWhat? Didn\u2019t you tell me to let you know if there was anything I wanted?\u201d She looked at him quizzically, and Arnold sighed.\nShe\u2019d heard that he\u2019d finished his mountain of work and even managed to sleep for a while. He was dressed in his usual military black, trimmed with a red mantle and black gloves.\nArnold shook his head. \u201cThat\u2019s not what I mean. I\u2019m guessing that Oliver didn\u2019t tell you the reason for this party? It\u2019s merely for appearance\u2019s sake. I need to look like I\u2019m searching for a bride within our borders as well. There\u2019s no reason for you to attend.\u201d\nIt made sense. The crown prince\u2014the greatest catch in the kingdom\u2014marrying a foreigner without even the slightest nod to propriety would invite unwanted discontent from the nobility.\n\u201cHowever, we\u2019re betrothed,\u201d Arnold said. \u201cThis whole evening is merely a formality. And with news that you\u2019re my \u2018hostage\u2019 going around, you\u2019ll be an object of curiosity. I don\u2019t want to put you through that.\u201d\n\u201cWell, I already went to the trouble of getting ready.\u201d Rishe plucked at her soft blue dress, draped in fluttering layers around her like a flower bud. She\u2019d braided her hair, decorating it with accessories. Her makeup was light, her shoes polished to a mirror shine. Her only jewelry was a pair of pearl earrings.\n\u201cRishe\u2026\u201d\n\u201cYour Highness, the court may consider my status as a captive princess shameful in the extreme, but I don\u2019t.\u201d She\u2019d chosen this course, after all.\nArnold was again watching her with a mixture of wonder and confusion.\n\u201cSo don\u2019t worry,\u201d she said, extending her hand. \u201cFeel free to show off your fianc\u00e9e.\u201d\nArnold relented, his dashing smile creeping out once again. \u201cVery well. I should take advantage of this opportunity to touch my betrothed.\u201d\n\u201cWe\u2019re wearing gloves.\u201d\nArnold took Rishe\u2019s hand.\nA throng of guests was gathered in the ballroom as a group of musicians performed on a platform. Women in gowns stood clustered, while gentlemen in military attire grouped together. A mere glance was enough to tell their clothes were of the highest quality. They mingled happily, making small talk with glasses in hand.\nRishe let her hand rest on Arnold\u2019s arm as she paused at the threshold to take it all in. \u201cThis is a bigger event than I was expecting.\u201d\n\u201cIs it? I\u2019d say it\u2019s a rather small gathering, actually.\u201d\n\u201cMaybe for a military powerhouse,\u201d Rishe muttered. \nYet another reminder of Galkhein\u2019s wealth took her off guard. Arnold just looked bored.\n\u201cThe size doesn\u2019t matter,\u201d he said. \u201cIn the end, they\u2019re only here for gossip. Look, here they come.\u201d\nIn the blink of an eye, they were surrounded by guests.\n\u201cPrince Arnold, thank you for gracing us with an invitation,\u201d said one man. \u201cSuch a pleasure.\u201d \n\u201cThe pleasure is mine, Lord Abel,\u201d Arnold drawled.\n\u201cYour Highness! We were so glad to hear of your safe return,\u201d another guest chirped. \u201cPlease, our daughter is simply dying to be regaled with tales of your trip.\u201d\n\u201cI can\u2019t imagine I\u2019d have anything particularly exciting to share with her,\u201d Arnold said curtly.\nAfter the last few days, Rishe found this look of glazed apathy disturbing. His good looks only compounded it\u2014he was so handsome that every expression was stark.\nHe looks more like Emperor Arnold Hein now, but still not the same.\nArnold appeared to notice her watching him. When he looked at her, his sourness disappeared, replaced by a genuine smile. All around him, women found themselves flushing. Arnold paid no heed to their fervent gazes, instead leaning in to give Rishe a brief moment of consideration.\nThen he leaned in close enough to kiss her.\n\u201cA dull trip,\u201d he said again, pulling away. \u201cBut fortuitous. Without it, I would have never met the woman destined to be my wife.\u201d\nA shocked murmur rolled through the crowd. Rishe, who hadn\u2019t recovered from seeing Arnold\u2019s beautiful face at close range, barely noticed the looks of utter loathing the assembled women were throwing her.\n\u201cH-His Highness is smiling? At his hostage bride?\u201d\n\u201cHe called her his wife?! He\u2019s never even looked at us!\u201d\nThey were whispers, but they carried.\nA portly man stepped forward with his daughter in tow. \u201cYour Highness, do you mean to say that this lovely young woman is your fianc\u00e9e?\u201d\nEvery eye in the ballroom was on Rishe, alight with curiosity, envy, or schemes. None of them could hide their contempt. But Rishe didn\u2019t falter.\nThis is nothing compared to being publicly dumped in a banquet hall. And I\u2019ve done that seven times!\nShe offered a polite smile and an astoundingly correct curtsy. Left leg at a diagonal behind the right, back straight, head bowed. \u201cHow do you do? My name is Rishe Irmgard Weitzner.\u201d\nEven the most hostile guests could find nothing impolite in her greeting, no sign of rough manners from the rustic daughter of a backwater nation. Rishe had years of training in expectation of ascending to the throne. Occasionally, habits from her other lives slipped through, but Arnold appeared to be the only one who noticed.\nNow he was looking at her with satisfaction. \u201cLady Rishe has only just arrived, and her acquaintances are few and far between. I hope I can count on you all to hold me accountable should I prove an incompetent husband.\u201d\n\u201cB-but of course, Your Highness.\u201d\n\u201cCome, Rishe.\u201d Arnold guided her out of the ring of spectators. The stares continued to follow them as they walked away.\nRishe dropped her voice to a whisper. \u201cYou sure know how to invite the ire of women.\u201d\n\u201cWhatever do you mean?\u201d\n\u201cThe way you harped on about me. Everything you said was tailor-made to stoke their jealousy. You\u2019ve gained me enemies, so thanks for that.\u201d\nArnold snorted. \u201cEverything I said was to protect you from enemies. They need to know you aren\u2019t just some trophy they can eliminate without recourse. We need to show them this to forestall any potential moves against you in the future.\n\u201cShow them what, exactly?\u201d\n\u201cThat I\u2019ll protect you no matter what.\u201d\nHe said it with such nonchalance that it brought her up short. Protect me? Arnold Hein, protect me?\nSuch an ironic position to take. She couldn\u2019t tell him that, of course. Her response came out somewhat strangled. \u201cI doubt they\u2019ll be anything to worry about. In fact, the biggest threat facing me is you.\u201d\n\u201cOh? And why do you say that?\u201d\n\u201cFor many reasons, the most obvious being that I\u2019m no match for you with a blade.\u201d As much as it pained her to admit it.\nArnold looked pleased. \u201cPerhaps we should duel.\u201d\n\u201cYes, please! And if it wouldn\u2019t be an intrusion\u2014I would like to train with you.\u201d If she studied him, she could learn his strategies and his attack patterns. She\u2019d never be a match in speed or raw power, but any insight would be invaluable.\n\u201cSure.\u201d Arnold shrugged. \u201cI don\u2019t mind.\u201d\n\u201cTruly?\u201d Her eyes glittered with anticipation.\nHe chuckled. \u201cYour answers never disappoint me.\u201d\n\u201cWhat\u2019s that supposed to mean? Oh, it looks like they\u2019re playing a new song.\u201d\nA soft melody drifted across the hall. The crowd divided, heading toward the center of the floor or against the wall. The next dance was starting, and everyone was waiting to see what the crown prince and his new fianc\u00e9e would do.\n\u201cWe don\u2019t have to dance if you don\u2019t want to,\u201d Arnold said.\n\u201cOh? As it happens, I like dancing.\u201d Plus, she couldn\u2019t resist a blatant challenge. She offered him her hand.\n\u201cVery well, then.\u201d Arnold only hesitated for a moment before taking it and steering her gently to an empty spot on the floor. He didn\u2019t seem like the dancing type, but his movements were slick and effortless. Facing one another, they joined hands. Arnold wrapped his other arm around her waist. \nOoh. His hand felt huge against her back. She realized she was breathing a little faster. They\u2019d never been this close before.\nNo, that isn\u2019t quite true. This is the second time. Rishe\u2019s final memories from her last life flashed vividly through her mind.\nThis was indeed the second time they had been this close\u2014the first had ended with a sword through her chest.\nEmperor Arnold Hein had single-handedly decimated the knights in the castle. Rishe stood in the midst of the carnage, breath ragged as she gripped the hilt of her sword, slick with her own blood. She was the last line of defense. The chamber behind her housed the royal family.\nIf they could reach the hidden passageways, the young prince and his party could find shelter with their allies across the border. Rishe and the other knights were prepared to sacrifice their lives to allow the royal family to survive. Their escape meant victory.\nBells tolled out, urging flight. All is lost. Run. Rishe managed to graze Arnold\u2019s cheek with her blade before she looked down to find his jet-black sword blooming out of her chest.\nShe remembered how it burned, as if the blade was made of fire. It was heat, not pain, but her breathing grew labored, and when Emperor Arnold Hein withdrew his sword, Rishe crumpled. \nHe knelt by her side and whispered something.\nThe words were seared into her memory. Rishe squeezed Arnold\u2019s hand as they danced.\nI\u2019ll be the bully this time. \nRishe shifted her weight back, slipping out of the hold on her waist. She broke Arnold\u2019s lead and spun, drifting on the harmony of the dance. She took him by surprise; his eyes went wide.\nI wonder what you\u2019ll do when you\u2019re no longer on top, Your Highness. Her smile was a declaration of war. Watching him attempt to follow her lead would be delightful. She pulled his hand toward her, attempting to move them into a spin.\nBut Arnold held fast. He planted his hand on her waist and turned them in a different direction, using her inertia against her. Hey! As a result, Rishe twirled by herself on the spot.\nShe didn\u2019t miss a step. She turned elegantly, the hem of her dress whispering across the ballroom floor. She heard appreciative murmurs from the wallflowers lined up watching.\nDespite that, Rishe took it as a defeat. Round one to Arnold. \nSo\u2026you can think on your feet. How about this?\nArnold remained unruffled, evading her next scheme like it was nothing. He grinned down at her, his eyes shining with a dare.\nHe thinks I can\u2019t beat him. His ease vexed her, but it was his smugness that made her angry.\nShe let out a hard breath, attempting a maneuver to lure him in while turning. He leaned back, not falling for it at all.\nHe\u2019s just too good at changing his center of gravity! She kept her astonishment under wraps, but she felt it. Despite how close we\u2019re dancing, I can\u2019t throw off his timing at all. He\u2019s sidestepped all my",
    "query_text": " attempts, and he takes back the lead the second I let down my guard!\nIt made her increasingly angry. She twirled and stepped as the dance dictated, all the while feeling out for moments of weakness. Arnold played along with her game, completely unruffled.\nEvery single time. I\u2019m doing my utmost to trip him up, but he doesn\u2019t even seem annoyed! At this point she\u2019d just settle for any reaction at all.\nTheir unusual dance style had gathered a crowd. Rishe paid them no mind, focused only on her goal. Then something occurred to her, and her breath caught in her throat.\nWait a minute, he has left an opening. It\u2019s the same one from before. She thought back to their fight to the death, to that moment when she had managed to draw blood. That may indeed have been his only weakness.\nIf I strike the same way\u2014huh? Before she could try, Arnold appeared"

    "prefix_text": " you? Who?\u201d\nRishe didn\u2019t know a delicate way to say I was thinking about a future version of you I met in another life.\n\u201cHmm?\u201d His tone was oddly light, teasing even. But the gleam in his hunter\u2019s eyes said she wouldn\u2019t get away so easily.\nObviously, Rishe couldn\u2019t give him an honest answer. \u201cI wasn\u2019t thinking about anyone else. I was worried about you.\u201d\n\u201cWhy?\u201d\nThis was the closest she could come to the truth. \u201cWere you injured here?\u201d She patted her own left shoulder with her forefinger. \nArnold went silent. His left shoulder was slightly slower to react than his right\u2014if his right was at one hundred, then his left was at maybe ninety-eight. It was hardly noticeable, but Rishe had picked up on it. He was right-handed, and she wouldn\u2019t have noticed it if they\u2019d been dancing normally. \nThat, and if it hadn\u2019t been for memories from her past life.\nRishe had only managed to inflict a single injury on him. An instant, a moment\u2019s hesitation where she saw her chance and slashed left. Of course, he\u2019d shrugged off the injury and effortlessly run her through. \n\u201cHeh.\u201d Arnold finally broke his silence with grim laughter. His eyes sent shivers down her spine, cold and bewitching. In lieu of an answer, he reached for his collar, unfastening the clasp with a snap and drawing his jacket open with a rough tug.\nOh my.\nRishe drew in a breath. A great scar was engraved into the nape of his neck, just low enough to be concealed by clothing. It looked several years old. \u201cIt\u2019s an old wound. It continues to the top of my shoulder and pulls the skin taut.\u201d\n\u201cHow awful.\u201d Rishe couldn\u2019t help but reach out to gingerly touch the nape of his neck.\nArnold accepted her touch without a word. She\u2019d half expected to be slapped aside.\nHer fingers slowly traced the shape of it. She could feel the rough skin through her gloves.\nHe must have gotten this over a decade ago. Someone stabbed him\u2014and not just once or twice. They must have done it over and over to make this scar pattern.\nHer medical training had her shuddering at the image of a nine-year-old Arnold ashen and trembling with blood loss. The fact that he\u2019d survived and retained the use of his arm was incredible. And then to go on to wield a sword so skillfully\u2014his suffering must have been immense.\n\u201cOnly a few people know about this injury. You\u2019re the first to notice on your own.\u201d\n\u201cHow did it happen?\u201d\nThat grim smile returned as he looked down at Rishe. With the moon hanging behind him, he was as opaque as ever, but Rishe understood the sentiment.\nI shouldn\u2019t pry.\nRishe pulled her hand away, and that ominous smile that sent chills down her spine disappeared. Arnold put his jacket back in order, reclasping it at the neck.\nSomeone tried to kill Arnold Hein about ten years ago. But who and why? Rishe cast her eyes down as she ruminated. The most obvious beneficiaries of a dead crown prince would be potential heirs and those loyal to them. I believe Arnold has a younger brother, but I haven\u2019t met him yet.\nOdd. Rishe might be a hostage, but shouldn\u2019t she meet her future relatives? Perhaps it was Arnold\u2019s doing and not the will of the imperial family themselves. He didn\u2019t seem to want to involve her in anything unless it was absolutely necessary\u2014he hadn\u2019t told her about this ball, after all. \nRishe looked up at him. \u201cYour Highness, may I select my maids some time over the next few days?\u201d \n\u201cVery well. I\u2019ll tell Oliver to make that a priority.\u201d\n\u201cAh, I can do the selection myself. We needn\u2019t trouble him.\u201d\nArnold arched an amused brow. Gone was that unsettling smile, replaced with his easy manner. \u201cWhat are you planning this time?\u201d\n\u201cOh, nothing important,\u201d Rishe said. She picked up her empty glass. \u201cI\u2019m merely concerned about the servants\u2019 working conditions.\u201d\nTo protect her life and well-being, she needed to keep from dying at twenty years old again. And to do that, she had to prevent Arnold Hein\u2019s war. Her best bet would be to appeal to the important people she\u2019d known in her past lives. People with influence.\nPlus, there was a mountain of things she needed to do in preparation for the marriage ceremony.\nI need to sow a plot of land, grow herbs, do lots of shopping, get cheap alcohol, and then\u2026 \nRishe began a to-do list that had nothing to do with war in the least.\n \n***\n \nAs the ball wound to a close, a lone boy stood in the gloomy courtyard of the imperial palace. He had soft black hair and round blue eyes. No older than sixteen, he had an androgynous grace to him, gaze fixed on the balcony above. \nHe was watching a girl.\nShe had coral-colored hair, and even from this distance, he could tell she was beautiful. She stood there alone, apparently waiting for someone. Whoever it was must have shown up because her hand slipped from the banister, and she stepped away. Not too long after, a man appeared where she had been standing.\nThe man turned a silent glare down into the garden, as if he\u2019d known the boy had been there the whole time, despite the shadows.\nA shiver ran down the boy\u2019s spine and he smiled reflexively, delighting in the intense aura of threat the man gave off. It was just a warning, it seemed, as the man abruptly turned on his heel and disappeared. \n\u201cAww, we can\u2019t play together either?\u201d The boy hung his head. \u201cI miss you, Brother.\u201d\nIt had to be the woman. The beauty. She\u2019d made the boy\u2019s life hell since the day she arrived. \nHis brother had prohibited him from attending balls like this one. That was fine; he\u2019d sooner avoid them altogether. Still, he\u2019d wanted to meet that girl. \n\u201cBut we\u2019ll meet soon enough, won\u2019t we",

Rishe was once again dressed to fit in with the maids. At Diana\u2019s shout, she looked up without pausing in her work. \n\u201cIs even laundry beyond your capabilities?

    "prefix_text": " him no mind. She had things to do.\nDuring her first loop, the prince\u2019s accusations had shocked her to the core and she\u2014foolishly so\u2014had attempted to defend herself. Now she knew better than to expect the prince to behave reasonably. \nHow will life unfold this time? I\u2019m excited to find out! Rishe fixed her mind on the future.\nThis is my seventh \u201cdo-over.\u201d I\u2019ve led happy and carefree lives before, but this time\u2014this time, I swear I\u2019ll live a long happy and carefree life!\nIn other words, she needed to avoid getting killed. At any cost. \n \n***\n \nIn the first loop, with her engagement broken and her reputation in tatters, Rishe roamed with nothing but the clothes on jewelry. Finding them a good-natured band, she hitched a ride to a neighboring country.\nFrom the merchant caravan, she learned a trade, studying how to procure stock and balance ledgers. Eventually, she set out on her own to travel the world. Her upbringing as a daughter of the nobility meant that, even at fifteen years old, Rishe possessed a keen sense for beauty.\nShe collected things that caught her eye and sold them to whoever found delight in her wares. Before she realized it, she had become a major vendor, employing a full staff. She had even done business with the king of a desert nation and the prince of a frozen country up north. She traveled to many distant places, realizing a dream born from her cossetted former life spent doing nothing but preparing to be queen.\nFive years passed, and just as she had only one country left to visit, Rishe fell victim to the war sweeping across the continent.\nThe next thing she knew, she was fifteen years old again and back at that party, with the prince poised to make his pronouncement.\n\u201cRishe Irmgard Weitzner! You are a vile woman! A truly malicious creature unworthy of the crown prince! As of this instant, our engagement is off!\u201d\nNaturally, she didn\u2019t understand what was going on at first. She looked around. Everything was the same. She stood in the same place wearing the same dress and draped in the same jewelry she\u2019d sold to the caravan.\nWas it a dream? Or was everything that had happened up until then the dream? In her confusion, all she could do was stare.\nRishe hurried out of the ballroom, the impending threat of exile hanging over her and the prince\u2019s entreaties to halt ringing in her ears.\nThis is perfect! Now I can get it right! I\u2019ll grab everything valuable from my room.\nRishe had enjoyed her life as a merchant, but she had always felt a stirring of regret about this night. If only she\u2019d brought some funds from home, she would\u2019ve had the capital to establish her business much sooner!\nSpeaking of this regret always prompted disbelief from her customers, including the king of the desert. \u201cWhat? That\u2019s what you\u2019d want to do over?!\u201d\nWhen she arrived back at home on the night of her second life, Rishe grabbed her jewelry box and as many of the books her late grandmother had left her as she could carry, then made haste to the forest to meet the caravan. But the stop at her house took time, and she missed them completely.\nIn that moment, Rishe made a stark realization. Different choices meant different mistakes. Opening one door would close another.\nAnd so the easy path to a life in commerce was closed to her.\nSure, she could try to build her business from the ground up, but personal connections were almost as essential to being a merchant as business savvy. It just wasn\u2019t realistic without a single acquaintance. \nSorting through her belongings in resignation, she came across a foreign encyclopedia of herbs among her grandmother\u2019s books. Taking it as a sign, Rishe sold her jewels elsewhere and used the funds to cross the sea and pursue the study of medicine.\nFortunately, Rishe retained all her knowledge from her previous life. She remembered that certain expensive herbs could be acquired cheaply in other regions. When word spread of a disease running rampant in a neighboring country, she recalled that too. This foreknowledge proved invaluable, as did her wide travel and exposure to many different teachers with many different points of view.\nAs such, Rishe led a successful life as an apothecary. She saved a feeble prince, synthesized a number of rare medicines with her mercantile knowledge, and thus spent her days in the simple joy of helping those in need.\nUnfortunately, all the joy in the world couldn\u2019t stand up to an epidemic. Thus ended her second life. \nOnce again, she found herself in the moment of her broken engagement, the curtain rising on the third loop. Her next four lives proceeded much the same way. As a skilled lady\u2019s maid, she helped a young noblewoman to a fortuitous marriage. Once, she even disguised herself as a man and became a knight. Every life was worth living, and she enjoyed them all. She enjoyed living, period.\nThere was just one problem.\nNo matter what I do, I die at twenty.\nShe enjoyed her lives, but",
    "query_text": " she was not permitted to do so for long. With this time limit always hanging over her, she spent each loop in a state of constant activity.\nI would love to take it easy for a while. Is a little leisure time too much to ask? Obviously I don\u2019t want to die either! This time, I\u2019ll make as much money as I can in the first five years. Then, when I turn twenty, I\u2019ll live a life free of worldly cares. I\u2019ll do whatever\u2019s necessary to stay alive!\nHer mind made up, Rishe began her seventh life in a dead sprint through the palace. Regardless of her future plans, she was in a race against time. She needed to beat the messenger bearing news of"

But right now, she needed to take care of herself. \n\u201cWell.\u201d Rishe suddenly broke into a smile, making Dietrich flinch. \u201cI think it\u2019s time for me to be on my way.\u201d\nShe regretted losing access to her room, but she knew her parents wouldn\u2019t let her in. Turning her back on the crowd, Rishe contemplated her next move.\n\u201cWait, Lady Rishe!\u201d Mary\u2019s voice rang out.\n\u201cThat\u2019s right. You\u2019re not going anywhere, Rishe!\u201d The prince joined her. \u201cYou won\u2019t get away with treating me like trash to relieve your own injured heart.\u201d\n\u201cUgh, enough already!\u201d Rishe\u2019s patience was fraying. \u201cI don\u2019t have anything else to say to you. Goodbye!\u201d\n\u201cKnights, stop her!\u201d\nReluctantly, the knights moved to tail Rishe as she walked briskly back down the path. She sympathized with them, but she wasn\u2019t about to let them keep her here. Rounding a corner, she sensed something uncanny. She stopped, the knights quickly catching up with her.\n\u201cMy apologies, Lady Rishe. If you could please remain for just a\u2014whoa!\u201d\nRishe grabbed the hilt of the knight\u2019s sword. Yanking it from his belt, she spun around and stood at the ready. Metal rang against metal as Rishe parried a blow. She glared at her would-be attacker as he stepped out of the shadows.\nArnold Hein!\n\u201cWell, what do you know.\u201d The man smiling so sweetly while their swords locked was the very man who had ended her life. \u201cYou do have some skill.\u201d\nMetal screeched and slid, before Arnold sheathed his sword. Rishe lowered hers. Neither looked away.\n\u201cWho the hell are you?\u201d demanded one of the knights.\n\u201cStand down, good sirs,\u201d Rishe said. \u201cYour interference will only make this worse.\u201d\nThis mostly served to befuddle the knights further. Rishe absolutely couldn\u2019t allow them to come to blows with the crown prince of a friendly nation. And they couldn\u2019t beat him\u2014not even if they took him all at once. Rishe had blocked his blow, but her arm was completely numb. To think he\u2019d be even more powerful in five years.\nHe regarded her unabashedly. \u201cRishe, was that your name? Where did you learn such swordsmanship?\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m afraid I cannot say. Besides, you were clearly going easy on me.\u201d\n\u201cHa! You could tell?\u201d\nArnold\u2019s manner was throwing her off. He seemed to be enjoying himself. He\u2019s laughing. This monstrous prince is\u2026actually laughing.\nWhen she had met him in her other life, he was cold and merciless, like a genuine monster. And yet here he stood, mellow and smiling.\nThe Emperor Arnold Hein I knew was twenty-four years old, so he\u2019s, what? Nineteen now? This is so weird. He\u2019s grinning like a boy getting into a scrape.\nThat attack had been good-natured as well, almost playful. It had muscle behind it but certainly not any lethal intent. He\u2019d just wanted to force Rishe to catch the blow. She found it unbelievable that he could exude such an overpowering air of menace when he was just messing around.\nWhile Rishe was focused on Arnold, Mary and Dietrich caught up, seemingly recovered.\n\u201cExcuse me, my lord!\u201d Mary squeaked. \u201cI-I-I don\u2019t know who you are, but kindly step away from Lady Rishe!\u201d\n\u201cYes, do as she says! Who the hell are you, anyway?!\u201d\nDon\u2019t tell me Prince Dietrich doesn\u2019t recognize one of his personal guests.\nDietrich\u2019s interests did not lean toward diplomacy; he likely hadn\u2019t bothered to introduce himself to Arnold. Mary, for her part, seemed to grasp that Arnold wasn\u2019t ordinary. She stood up to defend Rishe, despite the tremble in her voice. In a better world, perhaps the two of them could have become friends.\n\u201cThat\u2019s your ex-fianc\u00e9?\u201d Arnold cocked a brow. \u201cHe\u2019s even worse than I imagined. Pathetic.\u201d\nDietrich flushed. \u201cI\u2019ll have your head!\u201d\n\u201cDietrich, I beg of you, contain yourself,\u201d Rishe said, then rounded on Arnold. \u201cAs for you, Your Highness\u2014you know who Dietrich is, and you know what speaking carelessly could mean. Are you trying to pick a fight?\u201d\n\u201cWhatever do you mean?\u201d Arnold\u2019s brows lifted high, making him the picture of innocence. \u201cBelieve me, Lady Rishe, every word I speak is chosen with extreme care.\u201d\nFinally realizing who Arnold was, Dietrich visibly paled. \u201cArnold? He\u2019s the crown prince of Galkhein?\u201d\nMary yelped. The knights stood down, shamefaced. The gossip-hungry neighbors who\u2019d gathered to witness a scandal play out drew back in fear.\n\u201cHe\u2019s the demon prince? The one who single-handedly destroyed a whole order of enemy knights?\u201d\n\u201cWatch your tongue, fool! Do you want him to do the same to you?\u201d\nThe two nations enjoyed peaceful relations, but Arnold remained the dreaded prince, heir to the throne of a former enemy. Current rumor wasn\u2019t as widespread as it would be in five years, but he was still regarded with distrust.\nThe onlookers stood rooted to the spot, too terrified to flee.\nWell, this has devolved into a full-fledged disaster.\nRishe heaved a frustrated sigh. \u201cPrince Arnold, to what do we owe this honor? Surely a crown prince would not draw his sword for a mere jest.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m here on business,\u201d Arnold said. \u201cBut first, I must beg forgiveness for my rudeness.\u201d\nHuh, what do you know? Once he became emperor, he\u2019d gladly behead any subject who so much as dared speak a word against him.\nI guess at nineteen he still knew how to apologize.\nIf that surprised her, Arnold\u2019s next act completely obliterated her sense of reality. \nWith a flourish, he fell to his knees. \n\u201cHuh?\u201d Is this actually happening? \nHe was a man destined for an imperial crown. A man who would stand at the head of a military powerhouse and spread his rule across continents.\nArnold, known for his frigid pride, knelt to the disgraced daughter of a duke.\nAnd not only that\u2014his head was bowed, looking nothing so much as a knight swearing allegiance to his lady. If it were anyone else, it would be a delightful, pious image. Instead, the assembled looked on in terrified awe.\nNot Rishe, though.\n\u201cWhat are you doing?\u201d she hissed. \u201cGet up!\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m apologizing for my baseless impertinence. Also, I\u2019m asking you\u2026\u201d He trailed off to take Rishe\u2019s hand, tugging her forward so forcefully she staggered. He gazed up at her.\nUgh. He\u2019s so beautiful. No matter how many times she looked at him, it didn\u2019t become any less disarming. Long eyelashes, arched brows, a noble nose. His bright blue eyes reminded her of the drift ice she\u2019d seen in a northern kingdom, gazing out from a ship in one of her past lives. She knew she was dwelling on this to buy time, even as the reality before her sank in.\n\u201c\u2026to become my wife.\u201d\nShe froze, unable to process the words. \u201cWhat?\u201d Rishe glanced around, desperately searching the faces of the crowd. They all seemed as stunned as she felt. She looked down at Arnold again. \u201cYour wife?\u201d \n\u201cYes, that\u2019s right.\u201d\n\u201cYou want me to become your wife?\u201d\n\u201cYes.\u201d\nRishe couldn\u2019t speak. This was truly happening. It was real. It clicked into place in her head, and she let out a strangled grunt.\nWhat is going on? Why is this happening?\nShock lapped at her, fuzzing at the corners of her vision. He wanted to marry her. Arnold wanted to marry Rishe. Her murderer wanted to marry her.\nWhy is he doing this? He must have some ulterior motive, a broader goal. But I have to give him an answer.\nThe onlookers were holding their breath as Rishe said flatly, \u201cI reject your proposal.\u201d\nArnold said nothing.\nShe had to reject him. She was going to live a long, peaceful, carefree life, damn it, and no one would stop her. And yet\u2026\nArnold began to laugh, and the deep, creeping sense of dread inside Rishe only grew. Why does he seem so amused by this?!\n \n***\n \nHer previous life was her sixth. Disguised as a man, Rishe rose as a warrior of an island country she came upon in her travels. It was a conventional yet charming kingdom formed of red brick. After striking up a friendship with a group of knights who didn\u2019t realize she was a woman, Rishe followed their advice and joined them.\nThe training was grueling enough to make her wish she were dead. Back when she had lived as a noble, she\u2019d learned how to wield a sword for basic self-defense, but training as a noble lady had in no way prepared her for this. She drilled relentlessly, barely taking the time to sleep. Just as she became a full-fledged knight, Emperor Arnold\u2019s forces lay siege to the castle.\n \n***\n \nHow could this happen? \nIn her seventh life, Rishe wearily sank into her chair. Across from her sat Arnold, his legs crossed and chin propped up on his hand, watching her lazily.\n\u201cWhat\u2019s the matter?\u201d he asked. \u201cYou seem unhappy.\u201d\n\u201cYou could say that.\u201d Even her voice was grumpy. Still, she couldn\u2019t very well tell him it was because she bore a grudge from a previous life. After the first time her life rewound to that pivotal moment, she\u2019d resolved to keep her loops a secret. \u201cI had plans for my exile. A brand-new life. And now because of you, my parents are involved. Even the king has heard about it!\u201d\nAfter Rishe rejected Arnold, Dietrich had immediately cried out, \u201cTh-the crown prince of Galkhein proposed to Rishe?!\u201d\nHis shrieks were loud enough to attract the attention of the master and mistress of the manor.\nWhen her parents came out, Rishe had protested, \u201cI\u2019m not going to marry him! I\u2019m leaving the country just as Dietrich commanded.\u201d\nNo one listened. Their faces just paled with nervous confusion.\nJust then, a glittering coach arrived. Half-stuck in the mud, the man inside it was forced to trudge over the swampy ground, and so the king of Hermity himself arrived, staggering and dirt-stained. \nHe grabbed hold of his son\u2019s collar, pushing him into a low bow. He then turned to Prince Arnold and said, rather loudly, \u201cYour Highness! Allow me to apologize for my son\u2019s foolishness! You are an esteemed guest all the way from Galkhein! It is unthinkable he would not offer you the courtesy you are due!\u201d\n\u201cYou\u2019re hurting me, Father! My back!\u201d\nThe king then turned to Rishe. \u201cMy lady, allow me to sincerely apologize as both a king and a father. My son\u2019s behavior toward you has been utterly disgraceful. I beg you to please give Prince Arnold\u2019s proposal due consideration. Not only for your own sake but for the sake of your country.\u201d\nThe king bowed to her as deeply as his son had to Arnold, and her parents joined him. Rishe felt dizzy at the sight of this ab",
    "query_text": "ject debasement in the presence of citizens.\nArnold, who had been watching the proceedings with a detached amusement, sobered and stepped toward the king. \u201cYour Majesty, please rise.\u201d\nWithout the smirk, Arnold\u2019s face immediately reverted to its cold mask. The king didn\u2019t move. Maybe something in Arnold\u2019s voice kept him frozen.\n\u201cSuch a trifle won\u2019t cause discord between our kingdoms,\u201d he went on. \u201cHowever, I would beg a little time to speak with Lady Rishe.\u201d\nLater, Rishe would learn that Arnold\u2019s attendant had spoken to the king\u2019s own gentleman, certain that his words would reach their target. \u201cMy master took such trouble to attend these festivities, and this is the welcome he is offered? I wonder, what will the emperor think when he learns of his son\u2019s slighting at your nation\u2019s hands?\u201d\n"

The fact that he\u2019d been the man to kill her did nothing to lessen her fascination. In fact, it almost made it worse. The study of contrasts.\n\u201cSorry, I just\u2014\u201d\nShe was interrupted by the horses\u2019 loud whinnies.\n\u201cStop! Hey, stop the coach!\u201d\nShouts drifted back from conveyance ahead of theirs, which contained the luggage and attendants. The squadron of knights tailing the column of coaches sped off toward the front.\n\u201cWho do you think you\u2014graaargh!\u201d\nThat didn\u2019t sound good. Rishe moved to climb out, but Arnold was faster. He drew his sword.\n\u201cHey!\u201d\nArnold locked the door from the outside. \u201cStay hidden.\u201d\nWhy is he putting himself in danger? That\u2019s what knights are for! The fact that Rishe had been about to do the same thing didn\u2019t occur to her. It\u2019s probably bandits. He told me to stay hidden in here, but I\u2019m not so sure about that.\nArnold had left her locked in from the outside, hoping to keep her safe, but Rishe didn\u2019t like her odds. There were five coaches, but this one was certainly the grandest. It locked on the inside as well, but that wouldn\u2019t stop someone with enough determination. If she did as she was told, she\u2019d just be waiting patiently for a bandit to break a window and drag her out.\nKeeping one eye on the coachmen fleeing into the forest, Rishe began a methodical search for something to help her. Right\u2014her hairpin!\nThis sure brings me back. She unfastened it, twisting it into the gap in the door. Back when I was a maid, my lady would lock herself in her chambers all the time to avoid her studies. I had to break her out just like this.\nThe lock on the coach was simple, and it came open easily. Once she was free, she scanned her surroundings. She didn\u2019t see anyone who looked immediately hostile, but there was noise up ahead. Cautiously, she headed toward it.\nBefore long, she found Arnold.\nWow.\nRoughly ten men\u2014the bandits, she presumed\u2014lay crumpled on the ground. In their midst stood Arnold, in the process of tripping another man into the dirt. He scowled, blade at the man\u2019s throat. \u201cIs that it, then?\u201d\n\u201cGwugh!\u201d\nArnold kicked the bandit in the stomach, eyes blazing with cruelty. \u201cThat\u2019s all the thrill you offer me after I went to the trouble of drawing my sword? Barely worth it. I\u2019m bored already.\u201d\nHe wasn\u2019t angry; on the contrary, he stared his enemies down with chilly disappointment, as if this had all been a letdown. Even Arnold\u2019s own knights seemed terrified of their master when he was in a mood. Arnold smoothly flicked the blood off his sword, wiping the blade on the bandit\u2019s shirt before sheathing it. The rest of the men on the ground seemed to be unconscious.\nWait, he didn\u2019t kill anyone? Why not? Is it because we haven\u2019t reached Galkhein?\nShe supposed even Arnold knew better than to go around killing the citizens of other countries. Or perhaps he had yet to become the ruthless monster she knew him as.\nArnold seemed to sense her gaze, turning around with a start. Genuine emotion bloomed on his face, worlds away from the blank mask he wore to face down the bandits. \u201cHow did you get out of the coach?\u201d\nRishe shrugged. \u201cIf I tell you, you\u2019ll be able to prevent me from doing it again.\u201d\nArnold snickered. \u201cYou continue to amaze me.\u201d\nHow can you go from ice-cold to suddenly looking like a normal nineteen-year-old? It\u2019s disconcerting. \nRishe fought down her disquiet as a man alighted from a coach and shouted, \u201cYour Highness! Not again!\u201d He was Oliver, one of the prince\u2019s attendants. He had silver hair and was roughly as tall as Arnold.\n\u201cWhat do you think all these knights are for, decoration? Why do you insist on endangering yourself?\u201d\nRishe had only met Oliver briefly a few days ago, but he didn\u2019t appear to be intimidated by Arnold at all. And, well\u2026he\u2019s not wrong.\nShe feared the menace would return to Arnold\u2019s expression, but he just looked annoyed. \u201cI could tell they were prepared to kill. I\u2019d prefer to take the burden on myself than risk multiple injuries so far afield. And we already have casualties.\u201d\nHe was right. Several injured knights leaned listlessly among the trees. Arnold issued orders to those still able-bodied. \u201cFirst squad, see to the wounded. Second squad, arrest these men.\u201d\n\u201cYes, sir!\u201d\nOliver appeared unsatisfied. \u201cYour Highness, that is a weak justification. I\u2019m overjoyed you\u2019re well, but you must consider Lady Rishe. Perhaps next time we run into a team of murderous brigands, you could allow your consort to remain in the coach.\u201d\n\u201cI told her to remain in the coach!\u201d\nRishe quickly averted her gaze, turning her attention to the wounded knights. They didn\u2019t appear badly injured, yet they all seemed exhausted.\n\u201cExcuse me, can I take a look?\u201d Rishe approached the knight acting as a medic. He looked round, startled by her presence.\n\u201cNonsense, my lady. Don\u2019t trouble yourself, you must have had quite a scare.\u201d\nThis was not unreasonable, but the wariness in his eyes made it clear he wanted her nowhere near his comrade. He isn\u2019t just being polite. He truly is on guard. \nBeside them, an injured knight groaned as another helped him up. \u201cWhat\u2019s wrong with you?\u201d the second knight asked the first. \n\u201cI-I feel\u2026numb.\u201d\n\u201cWhat? Damn.\u201d The knight grabbed up one of the fallen bandit\u2019s swords, going pale as he inspected the blade. \u201cYour Highness, look at this. Poison.\u201d\nArnold clicked his tongue. \u201cLocate every laceration and bind them close to the heart. Suck the poison from the wounds.\u201d\nHe mostly got that right, at least. In the meantime, Rishe located the nearest bound bandit and pulled his dagger out of its sheath. Its wet coating gleamed in the sunlight, just as the knight had said.\nThey applied the poison liberally\u2014whatever it is must be cheap and easily bought in bulk.\nShe wafted the smell toward her, bracing for something rancid, but detected nothing. Then she brought it closer to her nose.\nIt smells sweet, like an overripe apple. Shea grass and\u2026bluecap mushrooms. All the knights appear to have the same symptoms, so I won\u2019t have to check every blade.\nRishe stood back up and headed for the coach.\nOliver took a step after her. \u201cYour Highness, Lady Rishe is\u2014\u201d\n\u201cLeave her. She may do as she pleases.\u201d\n\u201cShe\u2019s well trained,\u201d Oliver mused. \u201cBut a battlefield is no place for a young lady. She probably wasn\u2019t prepared for such a dreadful spectacle.\u201d\nRishe ignored the murmurs and focused on her work. There they are. I\u2019ll take these, these, and\u2026\n\u201cThe poison must be a sleeping drug,\u201d she overheard Arnold saying. \u201cHunters use such drugs to weaken larger prey. I doubt this dose is lethal.\u201d\n\u201cBut it certainly is annoying,\u201d replied Oliver. \u201cWe\u2019re still two days out from Galkhein. Lugging a company of sleeping men in armor won\u2019t be pleasant.\u201d\n\u201cWe\u2019ll have to stop somewhere nearby. A hunter\u2019s settlement. Perhaps they will have an antidote\u2014\u201d\n\u201cExcuse me.\u201d Rishe, who\u2019d returned from the carriage, raised a hand. \u201cI have an antidote.\u201d\n\u201cWhat?\u201d\nThe entire company stared at her in awe.\n \n***\n \nAs it turned out, Arnold\u2019s guess was right. \nThis sweet-smelling substance was a hunter\u2019s drug, made from ingredients that were only toxic in their raw form. Heat rendered them harmless. Rishe had encountered this poison several times before, curing a customer afflicted with it during her life as an apothecary.\n",
    "query_text": "\u201cA lethal dose for a grown man would fill a wine glass. They likely got less than a hundredth of that,\u201d Rishe explained to Arnold, not looking up from her work. \u201cStill, the numbness can block their airways with the roots of their tongues. It\u2019s best to lay them on their sides.\u201d\n\u201cYes, I understand the theory and the solution.\u201d Arnold gazed down at Rishe\u2019s hands. \u201cThe part I\u2019m struggling with is why you\u2019re the one telling me this.\u201d\n"

    "prefix_text": " For now, I\u2019ll just focus on what I can do. Like make this place livable.\nShe changed into her plainest dress and rolled up her sleeves. The knights who\u2019d remained to serve as her guard kept watch over her as she went from window to window, throwing them all open.\nIn a stroke of luck, the weather was good, and the detached wing was well placed to soak up the sun. The lack of any creature comforts made it look ascetic and drab, but once it was furnished, Rishe had no doubt it would be lovely.\nLeaving the top floors to air out, Rishe found the stairs to the basement. She pushed the heavy wooden doors open, and mice skittered over her feet. The knights yelped as Rishe descended into the darkness.\n\u201cL-Lady Rishe, why are you going down here?\u201d\n\u201cCleaning supplies are usually kept in the basement. See?\u201d\nThe knights followed her gaze to a duster, broom, dustpan, and pile of fresh cloths. She filled a bucket with water and went to work, rolling up a handkerchief to cover her mouth as she swept dust down from high on the walls. Then she swept up all the dust on the floor.\nIt\u2019s always satisfying to tackle a place this filthy.\nShe corralled the dust bunnies until they were piled up like snow in the center of the hall, and then she swept them out the open door. Once the floors were free of debris, she attacked them with the cloth.\n\u201cLady Rishe, is there anything we can do to help?\nRishe was grateful for the knight\u2019s offer, but she shook her head. \u201cYour job is to guard me, not do my housekeeping.\u201d\n\u201cThis is quite the place to clean on your own, detached though it may be,\u201d the knight said hesitantly. \u201cIt\u2019s not too late to move into the guest chambers instead.\u201d\n\u201cThat\u2019s all right. I like the place already.\u201d\nRishe remained steadfast in her refusal for one reason: readying guest chambers was an awful chore. The palace maids would be expected to work overnight to prepare them, even if the guests were only staying a single night. No speck of dust or strand of hair could remain. Certainly no wrinkled sheets. Rishe knew how exhausting and rigorous a maid\u2019s job was, how nerve-racking.\nShe refused to put the poor dears through such an ordeal for just a few days\u2019 stay. From the sound of things, the palace wasn\u2019t equipped with many housemaids. No doubt they already had their hands full.\n\u201cBesides, take a look.\u201d She held out her arms wide, gesturing to her sparkling clean floor. The knights stared at the bright room in admiration. \u201cCleaning a place with your own hands makes living there that much more satisfying, you see.\u201d\nThe knights smiled their awkward but good-natured agreement.\nRishe worked tirelessly, and before long, the chambers where she would spend the night were ready. The knights offered to carry in the bed, which she allowed.\nWhile they brought in furniture, Rishe started cleaning another room. She had run out of clean water, so she quietly slipped out to the well without informing the knights. It wasn\u2019t quite fair to them, but these were the palace grounds. Surely she didn\u2019t need to be chaperoned everywhere.\nBesides, they\u2019re guards in name only. They\u2019re clearly just here to report my movements to Arnold Hein, Rishe reflected as she walked through a courtyard full of flowers, bucket in hand. Iridescent butterflies cavorted playfully around her feet. He doesn\u2019t seem in a hurry to introduce me to the king. Although if I\u2019m just a hostage, that doesn\u2019t surprise me.\nShe hoped she got to meet the current emperor at least once. The future Arnold\u2019s violent conquest only began after he killed the man and made himself emperor, after all.\nI wonder what happened to Arnold Hein after I died in my past life. Did he reign supreme after winning his war? Or did some country manage to put a stop to his conquest? Whatever the case, I absolutely cannot allow him to start a conflict this time. Being the empress of a wartime nation sounds like so much work! The very thought is unacceptable!\nPerhaps they could divorce, but Rishe had a feeling that if Arnold decided to discard her in the middle of a war, she would fail in her mission to make it past the age of twenty. Better to avoid the situation all together.\nWait. When she thought about it, the cause of every single one of Rishe\u2019s deaths was Arnold and his war. I died fighting. I died when Galkhein\u2019s army invaded\u2026\nLooking at her six lives, all of them had ended in more or less the same way.\nRishe found herself crouched on the ground, cradling her head in her hands. Maybe we should get a divorce right now. But it wasn\u2019t in Rishe\u2019s nature to take back her decisions once she\u2019d made them. \nIf I leave, I\u2019ll probably just die in some war-related disaster again. If I can\u2019t live apart from him, I should take this opportunity to learn everything that I can. \nRishe didn\u2019t know the cause of her repeating lives, but there was no guarantee that the loops were infinite. She had to operate under the possibility that this life could be her last. This required some thought, but standing around seething with anxiety wouldn\u2019t help.\nRight now I\u2019ll focus on cleaning. Once the bath is here, I\u2019ll scrub off all the dust and travel exhaustion. And then I can finally relax! \nBrimming with new determination, she stood up and headed for the well. She was forestalled by the sound of jeering giggles. \n\u201cAww, look at the new girl, trying so hard,\u201d said one voice.\n\u201cAll the enthusiasm in the world won\u2019t make a difference,\u201d said another. \u201cWe\u2019re going to be the crown princess\u2019s maids, not you.\u201d\nThe first added, \u201cHey, are you even listening? Stop wasting your time!\u201d\nRishe heard a weak scream, followed by a thump, like a body hitting the ground. She broke into a run, finding a blonde girl sprawled in the dirt, surrounded by four other women.\n\u201cAre you all right?\u201d Rishe hurried over to help the girl up. Her maid\u2019s uniform\u2014a loose navy-blue dress with a white apron\u2014was smeared with mud. The others were dressed identically.\n\u201cWho are you?\u201d one of the girls snapped at Rishe. She had a mop of blazing-red hair. \u201cAnother newbie?\u201d\nAn understandable mistake. Rishe\u2019s dress was simple, free of ornamentation, and her hair was bound back in a ponytail to keep it out of the way. She was dust-streaked, sweaty, and carrying a bucket in her arms.\nTelling them who I am will be more trouble than it\u2019s worth. Her silence only angered the girls more.\n\u201cAre you one of the crown princess\u2019s maids? They\u2019ve been snatching up every new girl. Those pretty hands of yours don\u2019t look like they\u2019ve ever held a broom,\u201d said one of them.\n\u201cUnfortunately for you, we\u2019ve been working here three years, and we\u2019ll be the ones to serve Prince Arnold as the maids of his palace.\u201d\n\u201cCan you stand? Oh, good, it looks like you\u2019re not injured.\u201d Rishe helped the girl up out of the dirt. \n\u201cHey, don\u2019t ignore us!\u201d the redheaded maid shouted. \u201cYou\u2019ve got some nerve. If you want to make it here, you\u2019ll know your place! I doubt the two of you will last a week!\u201d\nRishe didn\u2019t respond, her attention snagging on something else. The redhead was carrying curtains, probably to bring them to the wash. Rishe stared at them so hard the maid began to shift uncomfortably. \u201cWhat\u2019s your problem?\u201d\n\u201cYou should wait to wash those,\u201d Rishe said.\nThe girl glared daggers at her. \u201cExcuse me? Are you telling me it\u2019s too late in the day? You really are an amateur! The light lasts longer in the spring, you know. And it\u2019s hot today. There\u2019ll be plenty of\u2014\u201d \n\u201cIt\u2019s going to rain, is all.\u201d\nThe maids exchanged glances. \u201cHow can you be so sure?\u201d\n\u201cLook at the clouds amassing. The butterflies and the bees are flying low. The moisture in the air will make the drying take longer.\u201d\n\u201cWhat?\u201d\nAnother maid spoke up in a soft voice. \u201cDiana, you were the one who said we should take the initiative to wash the bigger pieces. You said the crown prince would choose us for his household!\u201d\n\u201cStop putting the blame on me! This isn\u2019t my fault.\u201d An indignant flush crept over the redhead\u2019s face. \u201cThere\u2019s no way some upstart can tell what time it\u2019s going to rain! The weather is going to be fantastic all day. Come on, we\u2019re hauling these over to the wash!\u201d\nThe three girls meekly followed Diana.\nRishe sighed, turning to the blonde girl. \u201cAre you hurt?\u201d\n\u201cNo, I\u2019m fine.\u201d The girl\u2019s gaze darted around nervously. \u201cI\u2019m Elsie. Thank you for helping me.\u201d Her face was studiously blank, but from the way she struggled with her words, Rishe could tell she was being genuine.\n\u201cDon\u2019t worry about it,\u201d Rishe said. \u201cYour uniform seems to have fared less well.\u201d\n\u201cOh no.\u201d Elsie looked down at herself. Her face remained vacant, but she seemed sad. \u201cAnd I just got it.\u201d \n\u201cYou can get the dirt out if you wash it straight away. It\u2019s going to rain, but this dress should dry quickly. Use lots of soap, but don\u2019t scrub it by hand\u2014scrape the mud off with a brush.\u201d\n\u201cWhy a brush?\u201d\n\u201cBecause your fingers will just grind dirt into the threads. A brush is more porous.\u201d\nThe young sons of the family Rishe served spent their time tumbling in the dirt, and she had plenty of experience scraping mud out of clothes. She could even salvage dirty socks that had spent days crumpled in the corner.\n\u201cDo you\u2026 Are you\u2026\u201d Elsie trailed off, blinking rapidly a couple of times before finally looking Rishe in the eyes. \u201cAre you the crown princess\u2019s maid?\u201d\nUnsure how to answer, Rishe couldn\u2019t meet her eyes.\n \n***\n \nAfter parting ways with Elsie, Rishe returned to the detached wing with her fresh water. She put clean sheets on the bed the knights had installed, satisfied that she had a comfortable place to sleep. This room also had the highest-up balcony in the whole detached palace.\nTaking a break, she wandered out onto the balcony and looked off over the capital, the golden afternoon tinged with the onset of twilight. The day was fresh with a recent rain, the air clear enough to see for miles. The spring breeze felt good against her skin, sweaty from cleaning. Rishe leaned against the railing, leaning her head back and closing her eyes.\nShe felt like collapsing into bed immediately, but she desperately needed a wash. Still, she didn\u2019t want to pull herself away from the view and the breeze just yet. When she resumed gazing out absentmindedly, something her mother once said drifted back to her. \n\u201cRishe, there is no need for you to think for yourself.\u201d\nShe frowned, the memories coming thick and fast now.\n\u201cYou mustn\u2019t forget that the duty of our family is to live our lives fully devoted to the kings of the land. You\u2019re smart, but all the thinking in the world won\u2019t do a woman any good. You need only concern yourself with how best to serve the crown prince.\u201d\n\u201cStudies? Focus on social etiquette\u2014that\u2019s what you need for navigating high society. The crown prince\u2019s bride must be flawless. Your smile is lacking. You must always strive to appear amiable.\u201d\nRishe breathed out a long sigh. When I was fifteen, their lectures were the only thing I thought about.\nHer parents preached constantly. \u201cA woman\u2019s true happiness is to marry a suitable man and give birth to his heirs.\u201d\n\u201cBut, Mother\u2026\u201d\nObjection was not permitted. Any argument was immediately dispensed with. As a woman, Rishe could not inherit her father\u2019s title. Her only value was in her marriage. \nDespite knowing now that the opinions of others were as worthless as empty titles, the words still echoed in her memories.\nRishe\u2019s fingertips twitched, and she opened her eyes. Unmoving, she said, \u201cShouldn\u2019t you be seeing to your duties?\u201d\n\u201cMore hidden depths, I see,\u201d came a voice tinged with pleasure. Rishe straightened and turned. There was Arnold, leaning against the door to the balcony. \u201cYou seem able to sense my approach no matter how far or how hard I try.\u201d\n\u201cYou\u2019re quite naughty, aren\u2019t you? You\u2019ve been making your presence known little by little, emanating threat, to see how quickly I catch on.\u201d\n\u201cSo you noticed that as well.\u201d Arnold joined Rishe on the balcony. She tensed, but all he did was cast a curious glance at the view. \u201cWhat were you looking at?\u201d\n\u201cThe city.\u201d Rishe was hardly going to tell him she\u2019d been looking at nothing, merely ruminating on her mother\u2019s overbearing advice. The view from the balcony was spectacular, though. \u201cWhat\u2019s that over there?\u201d\n\u201cYou mean the library? The state invested funds to expand it. We have books from all over the world.\u201d\n\u201cReally? You have a library that big?\u201d Rishe\u2019s eyes sparkled with delight. She pointed out another building. \u201cWhat about that spire? It\u2019s beautiful.\u201d\n\u201cThe church and clock tower. The bells ring out the hour.\u201d\n\u201cOoh, how wonderful! And it looks like there\u2019s a rather big market there too?\u201d\n\u201cYes, the largest market in the city. Carts line up in the early morning. Most of the offerings are made fresh every day.\u201d\n\u201cAmazing! And what about that pretty mountain over there?\u201d\nRishe tried and failed to contain her excitement. She couldn\u2019t help but imagine what seeing all these places up close would be like. The grand library, the beautiful church that told the time, and the morning market with fresh, delicious food\u2014she wanted to experience it all.\nSeeing Arnold\u2019s bemused face, she said, \u201cWhat?\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m just wondering where all this interest is coming from,\u201d he said. \u201cYou were so reluctant to come, yet here you are, brimming with curiosity for my city.\u201d\n\u201cWell\u2026\u201d she trailed off, unsure of how to respond.\nWhat should I say? Should I just tell him the truth?\nThis wasn\u2019t a secret, but talking about her hopes and dreams to the man who had killed her was a little awkward. A strange self-consciousness settled on her, her cheeks heating as she mumbled, \u201cBecause I\u2019ve always wanted to.\u201d\nArnold looked at her keenly. \u201cWanted to what?\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019ve always wanted to come here.\u201d\nDuring her life as a merchant, Rishe developed her single dream to visit everywhere in the world. That dream was cut tragically short when only one country remained: Galkhein.\nIn each of her consecutive lives, Rishe\u2019s priority became staying alive. Every time, without fail, just as she found her footing, the world was plunged into chaos. She never had the chance to see Galkhein. This betrothal was her chance. \u201cIt\u2019s probably why I agreed to marry you,\u201d she added after a moment\u2019s hesitation.\nArnold swept a tepid glance over the city. \u201cThere\u2019s nothing here worth seeing.\u201d\n\u201cThat\u2019s not true! The places you just told me about sound amazing! Your citizens are clean and happy, your knights are proper and kind. Oh, and another\u2014\u201d \nRishe broke off enumerating Galkhein\u2019s charms as Arnold turned to look at her. His face was impassively calm, but something seemed to pass by underneath, like a shadow in deep water.\n\u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d Rishe said. \u201cDid I say something odd?\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m just amazed you could be so unaware of yourself.\u201d \nWh-what a rude thing to\u2014\n\u201cI\u2019ve never met anyone like you. No one has ever spoken to me the way you do. I don\u2019t know any girls of your class with the knowledge or the physical abilities you possess. Noblewomen don\u2019t concern themselves with such things.\u201d\nRishe, there is no need for you to think for yourself.\nShe frowned. \u201cPerhaps you\u2019re right, but everything I\u2019ve learned is precious to me. No one can take my skills away\u2014I value them with my life. Some may say that my knowledge is worthless, but it makes no difference to me.\u201d She turned from",

    "prefix_text": ". Apparently.\u201d\nSo not even his attendant understood his motives. Rishe remained at a complete loss.\n\u201cIf I may, however?\u201d Oliver mistook Rishe\u2019s confusion for anxiety and added, \u201cI have served Prince Arnold for a long time, and never before have I seen him so happy. When he is with you, he laughs. His smiles are sincere.\u201d\nRishe was taken aback. She\u2019d figured all of Arnold\u2019s laughter and teasing was at her expense. His own private jokes.\n\u201cAre you\u2026unhappy with him?\u201d Oliver ventured. \u201cWith his looks, His Highness is exceedingly popular with the ladies of the court, you know.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m sure he has many admirers.\u201d She paused. \u201cWould you really call the way he acts around me \u2018happy\u2019? To me, it seems more like a cat with a mouse.\u201d\nOliver laughed. He didn\u2019t deny it. \u201cI am pleased you understand His Highness so well. Oh, I nearly forgot. Here.\u201d\nHe held out a sheaf of three documents. \u201cThis is the guest list for your wedding. His Highness bids you look over it.\u201d\n\u201cThank you,\u201d Rishe said, pleasantly surprised. She hadn\u2019t even needed to ask. She gave it a quick glance, quickly identifying the most prominent and powerful names.\nKing Zahad, Prince Kyle, Princess Harriet. And from the Kingdom of Domana, we have Lord Jonal attending as the representative of the king. No surprise there.\nMore than a wedding guest register, this was a list of key people from the countries Arnold would go on to antagonize. Even before the murder of the king and the start of the war, there must have been a trigger\u2014a sea change in the affairs of state. Everyone on this list was most likely involved.\nKing Zahad. I hope we can be friends again like in my first life. Hmm\u2026 Prince Kyle is rather frail. I hope he isn\u2019t working himself too hard. He has a strong sense of responsibility\u2014he\u2019ll attend the wedding even though it\u2019ll be a long trip.\nThe sight of these names filled Rishe with a longing for those lives, for the people she\u2019d once known. And sometime in the very near future, they would all be Galkhein\u2019s enemies.\nIf I take matters into my own hands, perhaps I can salvage some of these relationships before they sour. Even if we aren\u2019t allies, we don\u2019t have to be enemies. Anything to stave off the outbreak of war.\nOliver had no idea what was going through Rishe\u2019s head. Brightly, he continued their conversation. \u201cThe ceremony will be held in three months\u2019 time. All preparations must be complete by then. And now\u2026we need to discuss tonight\u2019s party.\u201d\n\u201cTonight\u2019s what?\u201d\nOliver stiffened. \u201cDid His Highness not tell you?\u201d\n\u201cNo, he most certainly did not! There\u2019s to be a party?\u201d\n\u201cUgh, not again!\u201d Oliver dug his knuckles into his forehead.\nRishe put two and two together. She hesitated, then said, \u201cSo there is one, then. As you must know, His Highness is trying to stamp it down without telling me.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d Oliver replied. \u201cHe should have mentioned it to you. You don\u2019t need to attend, but he will. At least, I hope he will. I think I managed to convince him.\u201d\nShe sympathized with Oliver. Under normal circumstances, it would be unheard of for the crown prince and his fianc\u00e9e to fail to appear at a banquet. \u201cDon\u2019t worry, Oliver. I\u2019ll go.\u201d\nOliver let out a sigh of relief. \u201cReally? Thank you so much, my lady. I\u2019ll put finding you a maid at the top of my to-do list.\u201d\n\u201cNo need.\u201d Rishe smiled. \u201cI can prepare for the party on my own.\u201d\nThis maid-selection process made Rishe uneasy. After witnessing that exchange between the servants in the garden, she imagined quarrels breaking out all through the palace. And she doubted the disputes would go away even after they decided.\nOliver frowned. \u201cBut won\u2019t dressing be difficult without a lady\u2019s maid?\u201d \nShe shook her head. \u201cI can do my hair and put on a gown by myself. I brought dresses and cosmetics from home. Don\u2019t worry.\u201d\nRishe ignored Oliver\u2019s stunned look, already reevaluating her cleaning plans.\n \n***\n \nThe first thing Rishe said to Arnold that night was, \u201cYour Highness, I have a request.\u201d Her gown rustled as she leaned in close. \u201cI would like some herb seed and a corner of the gardens. I made a list. I hope we can discuss this in more detail later.\u201d\nArnold was silent a moment. \u201cRishe.\u201d\n\u201cWhat? Didn\u2019t you tell me to let you know if there was anything I wanted?\u201d She looked at him quizzically, and Arnold sighed.\nShe\u2019d heard that he\u2019d finished his mountain of work and even managed to sleep for a while. He was dressed in his usual military black, trimmed with a red mantle and black gloves.\nArnold shook his head. \u201cThat\u2019s not what I mean. I\u2019m guessing that Oliver didn\u2019t tell you the reason for this party? It\u2019s merely for appearance\u2019s sake. I need to look like I\u2019m searching for a bride within our borders as well. There\u2019s no reason for you to attend.\u201d\nIt made sense. The crown prince\u2014the greatest catch in the kingdom\u2014marrying a foreigner without even the slightest nod to propriety would invite unwanted discontent from the nobility.\n\u201cHowever, we\u2019re betrothed,\u201d Arnold said. \u201cThis whole evening is merely a formality. And with news that you\u2019re my \u2018hostage\u2019 going around, you\u2019ll be an object of curiosity. I don\u2019t want to put you through that.\u201d\n\u201cWell, I already went to the trouble of getting ready.\u201d Rishe plucked at her soft blue dress, draped in fluttering layers around her like a flower bud. She\u2019d braided her hair, decorating it with accessories. Her makeup was light, her shoes polished to a mirror shine. Her only jewelry was a pair of pearl earrings.\n\u201cRishe\u2026\u201d\n\u201cYour Highness, the court may consider my status as a captive princess shameful in the extreme, but I don\u2019t.\u201d She\u2019d chosen this course, after all.\nArnold was again watching her with a mixture of wonder and confusion.\n\u201cSo don\u2019t worry,\u201d she said, extending her hand. \u201cFeel free to show off your fianc\u00e9e.\u201d\nArnold relented, his dashing smile creeping out once again. \u201cVery well. I should take advantage of this opportunity to touch my betrothed.\u201d\n\u201cWe\u2019re wearing gloves.\u201d\nArnold took Rishe\u2019s hand.\nA throng of guests was gathered in the ballroom as a group of musicians performed on a platform. Women in gowns stood clustered, while gentlemen in military attire grouped together. A mere glance was enough to tell their clothes were of the highest quality. They mingled happily, making small talk with glasses in hand.\nRishe let her hand rest on Arnold\u2019s arm as she paused at the threshold to take it all in. \u201cThis is a bigger event than I was expecting.\u201d\n\u201cIs it? I\u2019d say it\u2019s a rather small gathering, actually.\u201d\n\u201cMaybe for a military powerhouse,\u201d Rishe muttered. \nYet another reminder of Galkhein\u2019s wealth took her off guard. Arnold just looked bored.\n\u201cThe size doesn\u2019t matter,\u201d he said. \u201cIn the end, they\u2019re only here for gossip. Look, here they come.\u201d\nIn the blink of an eye, they were surrounded by guests.\n\u201cPrince Arnold, thank you for gracing us with an invitation,\u201d said one man. \u201cSuch a pleasure.\u201d \n\u201cThe pleasure is mine, Lord Abel,\u201d Arnold drawled.\n\u201cYour Highness! We were so glad to hear of your safe return,\u201d another guest chirped. \u201cPlease, our daughter is simply dying to be regaled with tales of your trip.\u201d\n\u201cI can\u2019t imagine I\u2019d have anything particularly exciting to share with her,\u201d Arnold said curtly.\nAfter the last few days, Rishe found this look of glazed apathy disturbing. His good looks only compounded it\u2014he was so handsome that every expression was stark.\nHe looks more like Emperor Arnold Hein now, but still not the same.\nArnold appeared to notice her watching him. When he looked at her, his sourness disappeared, replaced by a genuine smile. All around him, women found themselves flushing. Arnold paid no heed to their fervent gazes, instead leaning in to give Rishe a brief moment of consideration.\nThen he leaned in close enough to kiss her.\n\u201cA dull trip,\u201d he said again, pulling away. \u201cBut fortuitous. Without it, I would have never met the woman destined to be my wife.\u201d\nA shocked murmur rolled through the crowd. Rishe, who hadn\u2019t recovered from seeing Arnold\u2019s beautiful face at close range, barely noticed the looks of utter loathing the assembled women were throwing her.\n\u201cH-His Highness is smiling? At his hostage bride?\u201d\n\u201cHe called her his wife?! He\u2019s never even looked at us!\u201d\nThey were whispers, but they carried.\nA portly man stepped forward with his daughter in tow. \u201cYour Highness, do you mean to say that this lovely young woman is your fianc\u00e9e?\u201d\nEvery eye in the ballroom was on Rishe, alight with curiosity, envy, or schemes. None of them could hide their contempt. But Rishe didn\u2019t falter.\nThis is nothing compared to being publicly dumped in a banquet hall. And I\u2019ve done that seven times!\nShe offered a polite smile and an astoundingly correct curtsy. Left leg at a diagonal behind the right, back straight, head bowed. \u201cHow do you do? My name is Rishe Irmgard Weitzner.\u201d\nEven the most hostile guests could find nothing impolite in her greeting, no sign of rough manners from the rustic daughter of a backwater nation. Rishe had years of training in expectation of ascending to the throne. Occasionally, habits from her other lives slipped through, but Arnold appeared to be the only one who noticed.\nNow he was looking at her with satisfaction. \u201cLady Rishe has only just arrived, and her acquaintances are few and far between. I hope I can count on you all to hold me accountable should I prove an incompetent husband.\u201d\n\u201cB-but of course, Your Highness.\u201d\n\u201cCome, Rishe.\u201d Arnold guided her out of the ring of spectators. The stares continued to follow them as they walked away.\nRishe dropped her voice to a whisper. \u201cYou sure know how to invite the ire of women.\u201d\n\u201cWhatever do you mean?\u201d\n\u201cThe way you harped on about me. Everything you said was tailor-made to stoke their jealousy. You\u2019ve gained me enemies, so thanks for that.\u201d\nArnold snorted. \u201cEverything I said was to protect you from enemies. They need to know you aren\u2019t just some trophy they can eliminate without recourse. We need to show them this to forestall any potential moves against you in the future.\n\u201cShow them what, exactly?\u201d\n\u201cThat I\u2019ll protect you no matter what.\u201d\nHe said it with such nonchalance that it brought her up short. Protect me? Arnold Hein, protect me?\nSuch an ironic position to take. She couldn\u2019t tell him that, of course. Her response came out somewhat strangled. \u201cI doubt they\u2019ll be anything to worry about. In fact, the biggest threat facing me is you.\u201d\n\u201cOh? And why do you say that?\u201d\n\u201cFor many reasons, the most obvious being that I\u2019m no match for you with a blade.\u201d As much as it pained her to admit it.\nArnold looked pleased. \u201cPerhaps we should duel.\u201d\n\u201cYes, please! And if it wouldn\u2019t be an intrusion\u2014I would like to train with you.\u201d If she studied him, she could learn his strategies and his attack patterns. She\u2019d never be a match in speed or raw power, but any insight would be invaluable.\n\u201cSure.\u201d Arnold",
    "query_text": " shrugged. \u201cI don\u2019t mind.\u201d\n\u201cTruly?\u201d Her eyes glittered with anticipation.\nHe chuckled. \u201cYour answers never disappoint me.\u201d\n\u201cWhat\u2019s that supposed to mean? Oh, it looks like they\u2019re playing a new song.\u201d\nA soft melody drifted across the hall. The crowd divided, heading toward the center of the floor or against the wall. The next dance was starting, and everyone was waiting to see what the crown prince and his new fianc\u00e9e would do.\n\u201cWe don\u2019t have to dance if you don\u2019t want to,\u201d Arnold said.\n\u201cOh? As it happens, I like dancing.\u201d Plus, she couldn\u2019t resist a blatant challenge. She offered him her hand.\n\u201cVery well, then.\u201d Arnold only hesitated for a moment before taking it and steering her gently to an empty spot on the floor."

I want to know all about House Toona.\u201d\nCornelia looked flabbergasted, but she recovered herself and nodded.\nThat should do. One of Rishe\u2019s eventual plans required a plot of land in a temperate climate. House Toona\u2019s would likely be perfect, but she needed to confirm a few things with Cornelia. Never back down from a fight. Even further\u2026\nShe recalled the words of her mentor from her days as a merchant.\nDon\u2019t bother with fights you can\u2019t win.\nThe other ladies fled, fearful of this strange girl who gulped down painfully spicy wine like it was nothing. \n \n***\n \nRishe retreated to the empty balcony to enjoy the music, grimacing with every stinging mouthful of wine. She drank it in decreasing sips until Arnold joined her.\n\u201cWhat are you making that face for?\u201d\nRishe swirled the glass. \u201cDon\u2019t worry, it\u2019s not you. It\u2019s just this wine is so spicy.\u201d\n\u201cSpicy? The wine is?\u201d\n\u201cMm. It\u2019s seasoned with capsicum. I barely managed to get that first mouthful down without gagging.\u201d\nArnold swiped the glass from her hand. \u201cDon\u2019t tell me this was a poisoning attempt!\u201d\nRishe clicked her tongue in annoyance at her own lack of vigilance. No one else would be able to grab something from her so easily.\nArnold glared at the wine. \u201cYou don\u2019t need to drink this. I\u2019ll get rid of it.\u201d\n\u201cHey, give that back! They ruined a perfectly good glass of wine because of me. I\u2019m not going to waste it.\u201d She grabbed it back and took another sip, shuddering at the taste.\nArnold glowered. \u201cTell me who did this. I\u2019ll have them executed.\u201d\n\u201cDon\u2019t be ridiculous. You don\u2019t kill people like her\u2014you use them.\u201d Just the tiniest bit of wine to go, but it was getting harder to make herself drink it. She gave the glass a reproachful look, then glanced back at Arnold. \u201cOh, and I owe you an apology.\u201d\n\u201cDo you?\u201d\n\u201cI used your name to defend myself.\u201d The girls had only backed off when she threatened to tattle to Arnold. Rishe found that sort of thing inelegant in the extreme, and she was embarrassed.\nArnold sighed at Rishe\u2019s apologetic bow. \u201cThere\u2019s nothing wrong with a wife invoking her husband\u2019s name.\u201d\nRishe hesitated. \u201cWe\u2019re not married yet.\u201d\n\u201cThat\u2019s a formality. It\u2019s as good as done, if you ask me.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2026see.\u201d\nHe took her distraction as an opportunity to swipe her glass back. Instead of dumping it out, Arnold gulped the rest of it down. \n\u201cDamn, that packs a punch,\u201d he grumbled.\n\u201cI told you that!\u201d Rishe snapped. \u201cAre you all right? Let me get you some water!\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m fine. But now you\u2019ve fulfilled your obligation to the wine, haven\u2019t you?\u201d\nRishe didn\u2019t know what to say. He\u2019d helped her\u2014not by taking charge but by following her lead. Without cutting her down and telling her she was being foolish. Without rolling his eyes and dismissing her desires as trifles.\n\u201cThank you,\u201d Rishe said stiffly, which just made him laugh.\n\u201cWhat were you thinking about when we were dancing?\u201d he asked.\n\u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d\n\u201cYou were thinking about someone else, weren\u2019t you? Who?\u201d\nRishe didn\u2019t know a delicate way to say I was thinking about a future version of you I met in another life.\n\u201cHmm?\u201d His tone was oddly light, teasing even. But the gleam in his hunter\u2019s eyes said she wouldn\u2019t get away so easily.\nObviously, Rishe couldn\u2019t give him an honest answer. \u201cI wasn\u2019t thinking about anyone else. I was worried about you.\u201d\n\u201cWhy?\u201d\nThis was the closest she could come to the truth. \u201cWere you injured here?\u201d She patted her own left shoulder with her forefinger. \nArnold went silent. His left shoulder was slightly slower to react than his right\u2014if his right was at one hundred, then his left was at maybe ninety-eight. It was hardly noticeable, but Rishe had picked up on it. He was right-handed, and she wouldn\u2019t have noticed it if they\u2019d been dancing normally. \nThat, and if it hadn\u2019t been for memories from her past life.\nRishe had only managed to inflict a single injury on him. An instant, a moment\u2019s hesitation where she saw her chance and slashed left. Of course, he\u2019d shrugged off the injury and effortlessly run her through. \n\u201cHeh.\u201d Arnold finally broke his silence with grim laughter. His eyes sent shivers down her spine, cold and bewitching. In lieu of an answer, he reached for his collar, unfastening the clasp with a snap and drawing his jacket open with a rough tug.\nOh my.\nRishe drew in a breath. A great scar was engraved into the nape of his neck, just low enough to be concealed by clothing. It looked several years old. \u201cIt\u2019s an old wound. It continues to the top of my shoulder and pulls the skin taut.\u201d\n\u201cHow awful.\u201d Rishe couldn\u2019t help but reach out to gingerly touch the nape of his neck.\nArnold accepted her touch without a word. She\u2019d half expected to be slapped aside.\nHer fingers slowly traced the shape of it. She could feel the rough skin through her gloves.\nHe must have gotten this over a decade ago. Someone stabbed him\u2014and not just once or twice. They must have done it over and over to make this scar pattern.\nHer medical training had her shuddering at the image of a nine-year-old Arnold ashen and trembling with blood loss. The fact that he\u2019d survived and retained the use of his arm was incredible. And then to go on to wield a sword so skillfully\u2014his suffering must have been immense.\n\u201cOnly a few people know about this injury. You\u2019re the first to notice on your own.\u201d\n\u201cHow did it happen?\u201d\nThat grim smile returned as he looked down at Rishe. With the moon hanging behind him, he was as opaque as ever, but Rishe understood the sentiment.\nI shouldn\u2019t pry.\nRishe pulled her hand away, and that ominous smile that sent chills down her spine disappeared. Arnold put his jacket back in order, reclasping it at the neck.\nSomeone tried to kill Arnold Hein about ten years ago. But who and why? Rishe cast her eyes down as she ruminated. The most obvious beneficiaries of a dead crown prince would be potential heirs and those loyal to them. I believe Arnold has a younger brother, but I haven\u2019t met him yet.\nOdd. Rishe might be a hostage, but shouldn\u2019t she meet her future relatives? Perhaps it was Arnold\u2019s doing and not the will of the imperial family themselves. He didn\u2019t seem to want to involve her in anything unless it was absolutely necessary\u2014he hadn\u2019t told her about this ball, after all. \nRishe looked up at him. \u201cYour Highness, may I select my maids some time over the next few days?\u201d \n\u201cVery well. I\u2019ll tell Oliver to make that a priority.\u201d\n\u201cAh, I can do the selection myself. We needn\u2019t trouble him.\u201d\nArnold arched an amused brow. Gone was that unsettling smile, replaced with his easy manner. \u201cWhat are you planning this time?\u201d\n\u201cOh, nothing important,\u201d Rishe said. She picked up her empty glass. \u201cI\u2019m merely concerned about the servants\u2019 working conditions.\u201d\nTo protect her life and well-being, she needed to keep from dying at twenty years old again. And to do that, she had to prevent Arnold Hein\u2019s war. Her best bet would be to appeal to the important people she\u2019d known in her past lives. People with influence.\nPlus, there was a mountain of things she needed to do in preparation for the marriage ceremony.\nI need to sow a plot of land, grow herbs, do lots of shopping, get cheap alcohol, and then\u2026 \nRishe began a to-do list that had nothing to do with war in the least.\n \n***\n \nAs the ball wound to a close, a lone boy stood in the gloomy courtyard of the imperial palace. He had soft black hair and round blue eyes. No older than sixteen, he had an androgynous grace to him, gaze fixed on the balcony above. \nHe was watching a girl.\nShe had coral-colored hair, and even from this distance, he could tell she was beautiful. She stood there alone, apparently waiting for someone. Whoever it was must have shown up because her hand slipped from the banister, and she stepped away. Not too long after, a man appeared where she had been standing.\nThe man turned a silent glare down into the garden, as if he\u2019d known the boy had been there the whole time, despite the shadows.\nA shiver ran down the boy\u2019s spine and he smiled reflexively, delighting in the intense aura of threat the man gave off. It was just a warning, it seemed, as the man abruptly turned on his heel and disappeared. \n\u201cAww, we can\u2019t play together either?\u201d The boy hung his head. \u201cI miss you, Brother.\u201d\nIt had to be the woman. The beauty. She\u2019d made the boy\u2019s life hell since the day she arrived. \nHis brother had prohibited him from attending balls like this one. That was fine; he\u2019d sooner avoid them altogether. Still, he\u2019d wanted to meet that girl. \n\u201cBut we\u2019ll meet soon enough, won\u2019t we?\u201d He spoke to himself in a soft voice. \u201cI\u2019ve got plans for you, Sister.\u201d \n\n(2) chapter number given is likely out of range: 0\nChapter: 8\n\nChapter 3\nChapter 3\n \n\u201cYOU\u2019RE ALL SO USELESS!\u201d Diana the redheaded maid\u2019s voice rang out inside the stone washhouse. \nThree days had passed since the afternoon Rishe shook off her guard and came out to the well. Rishe was once again dressed to fit in with the maids. At Diana\u2019s shout, she looked up without pausing in her work. \n\u201cIs even laundry beyond your capabilities? I asked you to wash these this morning, and now it\u2019s past noon! Meanwhile, we\u2019ve finished cleaning the entire first floor in a third of the time!\u201d\n\u201cI-I\u2019m sorry, Diana.\u201d\nThe new maids went silent with shame. Among them was Elsie, the girl Rishe stood up for the other day. Rishe pulled her hands out of the soapy water, gently rinsed them, and said, \u201cLet me help. What still needs to be done?\u201d\n\u201cYou again?\u201d Diana rounded on Rishe. \u201cI don\u2019t know who you serve, but I\u2019m amazed you have the time to do other people\u2019s work. I wish I had so much free time.\u201d\nHuffily, she turned from Rishe. \u201cLet\u2019s just ignore these useless fools. Laura, Maya. Come on. If we want to be chosen as Lady Rishe\u2019s maids, we mustn\u2019t waste our time.\u201d\nDiana took out a slip of paper from her pocket, smoothing it out. \u201cIt looks like the new bedsheets for her palace will arrive today. We should inspect them to make sure everything is perfect!\u201d\n\u201cWait up, Diana!\u201d\nThe two maids followed Diana out. Rishe waited for the door to close before turning to Elsie and the others. \u201cLet\u2019s keep working. If there\u2019s anything too large and cumbersome, feel free to pass it over to me.\u201d\n\u201cTh-thank you so much!\u201d The new maids went weak with gratitude. One of them, a girl on the verge of tears, even fell into a full bow. Rishe muttered encouragement as she scrubbed some bedsheets.\nElsie, who was washing the sheets with her, wore a rueful look. \u201cI\u2019m so sorry for the trouble. We\u2019re just not learning fast enough.\u201d\n\u201cYou haven\u2019t been working here long, have you? It takes time to learn a new job, no matter who you are,\u201d Rishe said as she kept scrubbing. \u201cAnd it\u2019s not like you\u2019ve never washed a single thing in your life before, right?\u201d\nElsie nodded nervously. \nRishe had realized over the past few days doing the laundry that not all the newcomers were complete amateurs. They\u2019d obviously done chores at home, or something similar. When set a specific task, they could perform it properly, but Diana\u2019s complaints weren\u2019t unfounded. They did take far too much time with laundry.\nBut it\u2019s obvious why. \u201cDo you know anything about Diana?\u201d Rishe asked Elsie. \u201cLike, is she from a well-off family?\u201d\nElsie said, \u201cI heard that her father was a business owner. She worked with him.\u201d\n\u201cI heard that as well,\u201d added another maid. \u201cBut he fell into debt and had to sell off.\u201d \nRishe stopped scrubbing for a moment to consider this.\n\u201cUm, is something the matter?\u201d Elsie asked.\nRishe smiled and shook her head. \u201cNo, nothing. Let\u2019s just focus on getting these washed for the time being.\u201d\n \n***\n \nThat afternoon, thirty maids were assembled in the detached wing of the palace. Ten of them were old hands, long in service to the royal family, while the other twenty were freshly hired. The crown princess was to choose her maids from among these thirty. They wore their nerves plainly on their sleeves. \n\u201cHey, I thought this palace was in a terrible state of neglect,\u201d one maid whispered. \u201cWhy is it so sparkling clean?\u201d\n\u201cYeah, you\u2019re right,\u201d said another. \u201cSomeone must have sorted it out before we arrived.\u201d\n\u201cI wonder what kind of person Lady Rishe is. Ooh, I\u2019m so nervous.\u201d\nThe girls looked around anxiously.\n\u201cHey, Elsie, that girl who was always helping us isn\u2019t here.\u201d\nElsie blinked. \u201cYou\u2019re right.\u201d\n\u201cLook, Diana. That impertinent newbie didn\u2019t get picked.\u201d \nAt her friend\u2019s observation, Diana preened with satisfaction. \u201cNo surprise there. You need some manners to attend to Lady Rishe. I bet she got kicked out of the running!\u201d Her eyes sparkled with confidence.\nAt last, there was a knock at the door.\n\u201cHer Royal Highness, Princess Rishe.\u201d\nThe maids quickly fell into bows. Diana\u2019s chest ached with anticipation as heels clicked on the floor, approaching the line of girls. From the corner of their eyes, the maids saw a wide-skirted court dress. A gentle scent washed over them.\nWithout even looking at her, they could tell Crown Princess Rishe was a lovely woman. Diana and her friends swelled with pride that she was to become their mistress.\nBut then Laura whispered to Diana, \u201cHey, isn\u2019t this scent familiar?\u201d\n\u201cQuiet!\u201d Clearly it was some sort of expensive perfume. Or so Diana thought, but then she realized what it was. The words just slipped out. \u201cIt\u2019s soap.\u201d\n\u201cHuh? Did you just say something?\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s soap. The same kind we always use.\u201d Diana was sure of it.\nThe princess said, \u201cPlease rise.\u201d \nWhy did her voice sound so familiar? An incredible foreboding gripping her, Diana looked up. She gasped.\n\u201cMy name is Rishe Irmgard Weitzner.\u201d\nBefore her stood the beautiful newcomer\u2014the thorn in her side for the past few days. The smile she wore was peaceful and just the slightest bit satisfied.\n \n***\n \nI\u2019m so glad I managed to finish washing the sheets in time!\nStanding before the maids with Arnold\u2019s attendant Oliver at her side, Rishe was panicking on the inside. She\u2019d had so much to do this morning that she\u2019d put off the laundry to the last minute. She took deep, controlled breaths, praying no one would notice that she\u2019d raced here at a dead sprint.\nOliver was none the wiser as he spoke to the assembled girls. Rishe took the opportunity to look them over. She locked eyes with Elsie, who was gaping at her. It was a nice change\u2014usually her face was as blank as a rock wall.\nI\u2019m sorry for the deception. I figured blending in would give me the best picture of your working conditions.\nThe new maids wore similarly shocked expressions, while others watched her with delight. Meanwhile, the veterans",
    "query_text": ", including Diana, had all gone pale. They trembled, stunned into silence. One seemed locked in a terrifying trance, while another looked on the verge of tears. All of them had spoken to Rishe with derision. As the ringleader, Diana was covering her mouth with both hands, like she was holding in a scream.\nOliver had finished his introduction. \u201cYour Highness, if you would?\u201d\nRishe stepped forward. \u201cFirst, I must apologize to you for what has transpired prior to this meeting. My deception, that is. However, it has granted me insight into how each one of you works.\u201d\nOliver\u2019s face creased in confusion. The newcomer maids began to panic, whispering among themselves.\n\u201cDoesn\u2019t this mean that she helped us out with the laundry?\u201d\n\u201cWe"

It\u2019s just, I had nothing. Or so it felt like. No money, no title. I thought I had to make my way in the world on my own. That I had to start from zero.\u201d Her shoulders trembled as she buried her face in her hands. \u201cBut I was wrong! I wasn\u2019t starting from zero. I had everything that I learned growing up. I didn\u2019t realize how fortunate I was. I let it all go to my he\n \n\u201cRISHE IRMGARD WEITZNER! You are a vile woman! A truly malicious creature unworthy of the crown prince! As of this instant, our engagement is off!\u201d \n\u201cAs you wish, Your Highness.\u201d\n\u201c\u2026Huh?\u201d\nThe prince\u2019s declaration echoed throughout the ballroom. Rishe, the duke\u2019s daughter, bowed in response, her coral-toned hair swaying gracefully. The assembled guests found themselves captivated by her dignified beauty. Despite having just witnessed a broken engagement, they couldn\u2019t bring themselves to pity her.\nSlowly, Rishe lifted her head and fixed the prince with a pale-emerald gaze. It caught him off guard, but he quickly recovered.\n\u201cDidn\u2019t you hear what I just said?! I\u2019m calling off our engagement! Doesn\u2019t that trouble you?\u201d\n\u201cNot really.\u201d\nRishe already knew what happened next: false accusations, exile, and her family severing all ties and leaving her to survive on her own. She turned from the prince. There was no point wasting any time.\nThis is my seventh loop, after all.\nRishe had done this all before.\nThe next few hours will be busy. I must hurry and retrieve my things before I\u2019m barred from the family estate. I don\u2019t want this to be one of the times I\u2019m too slow and I have to start my new life with nothing.\n\u201cRishe, halt and hear me! I have spent the past week perfecting my recitation of your crimes!\u201d\nI should take more than dresses this time\u2014there\u2019s plenty of things I could use out in the world. What trade should I take up? In my first life, I was a merchant. In my second, an apothecary. I\u2019ve got a few more I want to try out\u2026 Augh! If time\u2019s just going to keep resetting, I wish I could start at an earlier point. I need more time to prepare!\n\u201cWait! Rishe!\u201d\nThe crown prince was on the verge of tears, and the spectators struggled to suppress their snickers. \nA thought occurred to Rishe, and she stopped. She then turned, her eyes gleaming beneath long lashes as she stared down her ex-fianc\u00e9. \u201cAh, Your Highness, I almost forgot.\u201d \n\u201cYes, tell me!\u201d the prince fumed. \u201cLet me guess, you are hurt beyond measure and yet love me still\u2026correct?\u201d\nAs if. Rishe was grateful to be granted her freedom. In fact, she was smiling as she said, \u201cI hope you and Lady Mary are happy together.\u201d\n\u201cWhat?!\u201d\n\u201cMay we both lead fulfilling lives. Farewell!\u201d Rishe lifted the skirts of her evening gown and turned on her heel, departing as briskly as she could.\n\u201cHow do you know about Mary? I haven\u2019t told you I love her!\u201d The prince was shouting something behind her, but she paid him no mind. She had things to do.\nDuring her first loop, the prince\u2019s accusations had shocked her to the core and she\u2014foolishly so\u2014had attempted to defend herself. Now she knew better than to expect the prince to behave reasonably. \nHow will life unfold this time? I\u2019m excited to find out! Rishe fixed her mind on the future.\nThis is my seventh \u201cdo-over.\u201d I\u2019ve led happy and carefree lives before, but this time\u2014this time, I swear I\u2019ll live a long happy and carefree life!\nIn other words, she needed to avoid getting killed. At any cost. \n \n***\n \nIn the first loop, with her engagement broken and her reputation in tatters, Rishe roamed with nothing but the clothes on jewelry. Finding them a good-natured band, she hitched a ride to a neighboring country.\nFrom the merchant caravan, she learned a trade, studying how to procure stock and balance ledgers. Eventually, she set out on her own to travel the world. Her upbringing as a daughter of the nobility meant that, even at fifteen years old, Rishe possessed a keen sense for beauty.\nShe collected things that caught her eye and sold them to whoever found delight in her wares. Before she realized it, she had become a major vendor, employing a full staff. She had even done business with the king of a desert nation and the prince of a frozen country up north. She traveled to many distant places, realizing a dream born from her cossetted former life spent doing nothing but preparing to be queen.\nFive years passed, and just as she had only one country left to visit, Rishe fell victim to the war sweeping across the continent.\nThe next thing she knew, she was fifteen years old again and back at that party, with the prince poised to make his pronouncement.\n\u201cRishe Irmgard Weitzner! You are a vile woman! A truly malicious creature unworthy of the crown prince! As of this instant, our engagement is off!\u201d\nNaturally, she didn\u2019t understand what was going on at first. She looked around. Everything was the same. She stood in the same place wearing the same dress and draped in the same jewelry she\u2019d sold to the caravan.\nWas it a dream? Or was everything that had happened up until then the dream? In her confusion, all she could do was stare.\nRishe hurried out of the ballroom, the impending threat of exile hanging over her and the prince\u2019s entreaties to halt ringing in her ears.\nThis is perfect! Now I can get it right! I\u2019ll grab everything valuable from my room.\nRishe had enjoyed her life as a merchant, but she had always felt a stirring of regret about this night. If only she\u2019d brought some funds from home, she would\u2019ve had the capital to establish her business much sooner!\nSpeaking of this regret always prompted disbelief from her customers, including the king of the desert. \u201cWhat? That\u2019s what you\u2019d want to do over?!\u201d\nWhen she arrived back at home on the night of her second life, Rishe grabbed her jewelry box and as many of the books her late grandmother had left her as she could carry, then made haste to the forest to meet the caravan. But the stop at her house took time, and she missed them completely.\nIn that moment, Rishe made a stark realization. Different choices meant different mistakes. Opening one door would close another.\nAnd so the easy path",

His legs seemed to go out from under him, and he crumpled. At that, the knights finally let go of their composure, laughing along with the courtiers.\n\u201cSt-stop!\u201d the prince wailed. \u201cYou are my subjects. This\u2026this shows such flagrant disrespect!\u201d\n\u201cDietrich, don\u2019t pay them any mind,\u201d Lady Mary said. \u201cLady Rishe, is this cruelty necessary?\u201d\n\u201cPerhaps this is a blessing in disguise.\u201d Rishe\u2019s attention moved to Mary, making the girl\u2019s slender shoulders jump. She had no reason to worry; Rishe didn\u2019t bite. \u201cI\u2019ve been wanting the opportunity to speak to you, Lady Mary. You\u2019re strong. I admire you very much.\u201d\n\u201cWhat are you talking about?\u201d\n\u201cYou\u2019re a lovely girl who never fails to smile despite your troubles. You don\u2019t put up walls around your heart, and you do your utmost to put others at ease. Even now, you bravely stand before me to protect the prince.\u201d\nMary\u2019s eyes were wide with confusion. Rishe picked her words carefully, attempting to diminish the girl\u2019s guilty feelings, if only a little. \u201cYou need to marry the prince for your family\u2019s sake, right?\u201d\n\u201cHow do you\u2014?\u201d\nRishe had learned this truth in one of her past lives. Mary was born to a poor family, and she had studied like mad to be accepted into the academy to hunt for a husband. She intended to make sure neither she nor her brothers ever went hungry again.\nShe went on, \u201cRemember this: you are the one in control of your life. Don\u2019t sell it to anyone else. Can you trust a man who so easily discards the woman he\u2019s been engaged to since childhood? Do you truly believe he cares for you?\u201d\nAstonishment bloomed across Mary\u2019s face. She looked over at Dietrich, who hadn\u2019t bothered to stand up. The truth was\u2026within a year, Prince Dietrich would be in prison, his title stripped from him. He would plan a mad coup d\u2019\u00e9tat against the king, attempting to provoke the citizens to war. His plan would be discovered in its early stages, rendering him a laughingstock across the kingdom.\n\u201cYou must shape your future with your own hands\u2014you mustn\u2019t entrust your desires to others.\u201d \n\u201cMy\u2026my desires?\nRishe nodded.\nMary was looking at her like she was speaking a foreign language. \u201cBut I\u2019m their elder sister.\u201d Her voice quivered. \u201cI must endure, no matter what. Otherwise, my brothers will never be happy.\u201d\n\u201cAnd you believe their happiness can only be achieved by sacrificing your own?\u201d\nMary gasped as she gaped at Rishe.\n\u201cYou don\u2019t need to throw away your own future to protect those you love,\u201d Rishe told her. \u201cNo matter what path you choose, never forget that.\u201d\n\u201cMy future?\u201d Mary\u2019s voice went ragged, like she was barely suppressing a wail of pain.\n\u201cI wish you a life where both you and your family can be happy,\u201d said Rishe.\nMary stood frozen in place, eyes gleaming like precious stones. Rishe couldn\u2019t help but admire how pretty she was. She truly did wish her happiness. But right now, she needed to take care of herself. \n\u201cWell.\u201d Rishe suddenly broke into a smile, making Dietrich flinch. \u201cI think it\u2019s time for me to be on my way.\u201d\nShe regretted losing access to her room, but she knew her parents wouldn\u2019t let her in. Turning her back on the crowd, Rishe contemplated her next move.\n\u201cWait, Lady Rishe!\u201d Mary\u2019s voice rang out.\n\u201cThat\u2019s right. You\u2019re not going anywhere, Rishe!\u201d The prince joined her. \u201cYou won\u2019t get away with treating me like trash to relieve your own injured heart.\u201d\n\u201cUgh, enough already!\u201d Rishe\u2019s patience was fraying. \u201cI don\u2019t have anything else to say to you. Goodbye!\u201d\n\u201cKnights, stop her!\u201d\nReluctantly, the knights moved to tail Rishe as she walked briskly back down the path. She sympathized with them, but she wasn\u2019t about to let them keep her here. Rounding a corner, she sensed something uncanny. She stopped, the knights quickly catching up with her.\n\u201cMy apologies, Lady Rishe. If you could please remain for just a\u2014whoa!\u201d\nRishe grabbed the hilt of the knight\u2019s sword. Yanking it from his belt, she spun around and stood at the ready. Metal rang against metal as Rishe parried a blow. She glared at her would-be attacker as he stepped out of the shadows.\nArnold Hein!\n\u201cWell, what do you know.\u201d The man smiling so sweetly while their swords locked was the very man who had ended her life. \u201cYou do have some skill.\u201d\nMetal screeched and slid, before Arnold sheathed his sword. Rishe lowered hers. Neither looked away.\n\u201cWho the hell are you?\u201d demanded one of the knights.\n\u201cStand down, good sirs,\u201d Rishe said. \u201cYour interference will only make this worse.\u201d\nThis mostly served to befuddle the knights further.

And you were also a member of the court? How in the world did you find the time?\u201d\nRishe shrugged. She couldn\u2019t just say, I pretended to be a man in a previous life, that\u2019s how.\n\u201cI assume there\u2019s more to you than your devotion to the sword. You seem to like flowers.\u201d\nShe followed Arnold\u2019s gaze to where she\u2019d bundled a small bouquet in a handkerchief. This was their fifth day on the road to Galkhein. Every day, without fail, she\u2019d picked flowers whenever they stopped to water the horses. The ones from today were still fresh, but the ones she\u2019d begun drying five days ago were just about ready.\n\u201cI didn\u2019t pick these because they\u2019re pretty.\u201d Rishe brought the blooms to her face, spirits rising at their sweet scent. Spring wildflowers had a soft and gentle smell. Rishe looked out the window at the forest spreading toward Galkhein, thinking of the rare native flowers going into bloom. She wished she could pick those as well, but that would cause too much delay. She gazed on wistfully.\nAfter watching her in silence for some time, Arnold said, \u201cBy the way, I sent one of my men ahead on a fast horse to deliver your order to the company you requested. They\u2019ll be invited to Galkhein to discuss the wedding ceremony.\u201d\n\u201cThank you,\u201d Rishe said. \u201cI\u2019m glad you kept your word.\u201d\n\u201cThe Aria Trading Company,\u201d Arnold mused. \u201cI\u2019ve heard of them. They\u2019re up-and-comers, aren\u2019t they? Have you done business with them before?\u201d\n\u201cNo, but I heard from a friend that they hold a very high standard of quality.\u201d\nRishe was pleasantly surprised at how easily Arnold had acceded to her request. Typically, a royal household had their own personal dealer. Getting them to do business with someone else could be difficult.\nI want to establish a connection with Aria as soon as possible, Rishe thought. It was, of course, the company that had taken her in during her first life.\nThe company had been established just two years prior to picking her up by its owner, a man named Tully. They were still in their growth stage, but in just a few years, they would be the grandest trading company in all the world. They\u2019d proven a great boon in her life as an apothecary as well, helping to distribute her newest medicines. She\u2019d struggled to win their trust initially, but she pledged to work much harder this time around.\nThis marriage isn\u2019t going to happen\u2014I need an escape plan for when it all falls apart. I must bring to bear all my knowledge and influence as a crown princess.\nRishe didn\u2019t know Arnold\u2019s plans, but she had no intention of sitting around and waiting for him to use her as he pleased. She\u2019d spend her time as his consort wisely. Everything must serve her ultimate goal: to live longer than five years, and live well.\nHer fierce determination must have shown on her face because Arnold gave her a little bemused smile. \u201cYes?\u201d\nGod! Rishe grimaced at that flawlessly handsome countenance. Such beauty, possessed by such powerful destruction. The fact that he\u2019d been the man to kill her did nothing to lessen her fascination. In fact, it almost made it worse. The study of contrasts.\n\u201cSorry, I just\u2014\u201d\nShe was interrupted by the horses\u2019 loud whinnies.\n\u201cStop! Hey, stop the coach!\u201d\nShouts drifted back from conveyance ahead of theirs, which contained the luggage and attendants. The squadron of knights tailing the column of coaches sped off toward the front.\n\u201cWho do you think you\u2014graaargh!\u201d\nThat didn\u2019t sound good. Rishe moved to climb out, but Arnold was faster. He drew his sword.\n\u201cHey!\u201d\nArnold locked the door from the outside. \u201cStay hidden.\u201d\nWhy is he putting himself in danger? That\u2019s what knights are for! The fact that Rishe had been about to do the same thing didn\u2019t occur to her. It\u2019s probably bandits. He told me to stay hidden in here, but I\u2019m not so sure about that.\nArnold had left her locked in from the outside, hoping to keep her safe, but Rishe didn\u2019t like her odds. There were five coaches, but this one was certainly the grandest. It locked on the inside as well, but that wouldn\u2019t stop someone with enough determination. If she did as she was told, she\u2019d just be waiting patiently for a bandit to break a window and drag her out.\nKeeping one eye on the coachmen fleeing into the forest, Rishe began a methodical search for something to help her. Right\u2014her hairpin!\nThis sure brings me back. She unfastened it, twisting it into the gap in the door. Back when I was a maid, my lady would lock herself in her chambers all the time to avoid her studies. I had to break her out just like this.\nThe lock on the coach was simple, and it came open easily. Once she was free, she scanned her surroundings. She didn\u2019t see anyone who looked immediately hostile, but there was noise up ahead. Cautiously, she headed toward it.\nBefore long, she found Arnold.\nWow.\nRoughly ten men\u2014the bandits, she presumed\u2014lay crumpled on the ground. In their midst stood Arnold, in the process of tripping another man into the dirt. He scowled, blade at the man\u2019s throat. \u201cIs that it, then?\u201d\n\u201cGwugh!\u201d\nArnold kicked the bandit in the stomach, eyes blazing with cruelty. \u201cThat\u2019s all the thrill you offer me after I went to the trouble of drawing my sword? Barely worth it. I\u2019m bored already.\u201d\nHe wasn\u2019t angry; on the contrary, he stared his enemies down with chilly disappointment, as if this had all been a letdown. Even Arnold\u2019s own knights seemed terrified of their master when he was in a mood. Arnold smoothly flicked the blood off his sword, wiping the blade on the bandit\u2019s shirt before sheathing it. The rest of the men on the ground seemed to be unconscious.\nWait, he didn\u2019t kill anyone? Why not? Is it because we haven\u2019t reached Galkhein?\nShe supposed even Arnold knew better than to go around killing the citizens of other countries. Or perhaps he had yet to become the ruthless monster she knew him as.\nArnold seemed to sense her gaze, turning around with a start. Genuine emotion bloomed on his face, worlds away from the blank mask he wore to face down the bandits. \u201cHow did you get out of the coach?\u201d\nRishe shrugged. \u201cIf I tell you, you\u2019ll be able to prevent me from doing it again.\u201d\nArnold snickered. \u201cYou continue to amaze me.\u201d\nHow can you go from ice-cold to suddenly looking like a normal nineteen-year-old? It\u2019s disconcerting. \nRishe fought down her disquiet as a man alighted from a coach and shouted, \u201cYour Highness! Not again!\u201d He was Oliver, one of the prince\u2019s attendants. He had silver hair and was roughly as tall as Arnold.\n\u201cWhat do you think all these knights are for, decoration? Why do you insist on endangering yourself?\u201d\nRishe had only met Oliver briefly a few days ago, but he didn\u2019t appear to be intimidated by Arnold at all. And, well\u2026he\u2019s not wrong.\nShe feared the menace would return to Arnold\u2019s expression, but he just looked annoyed. \u201cI could tell they were prepared to kill. I\u2019d prefer to take the burden on myself than risk multiple injuries so far afield. And we already have casualties.\u201d\nHe was right. Several injured knights leaned listlessly among the trees. Arnold issued orders to those still able-bodied. \u201cFirst squad, see to the wounded. Second squad, arrest these men.\u201d\n\u201cYes, sir!\u201d\nOliver appeared unsatisfied. \u201cYour Highness, that is a weak justification. I\u2019m overjoyed you\u2019re well, but you must consider Lady Rishe. Perhaps next time we run into a team of murderous brigands, you could allow your consort to remain in the coach.\u201d\n\u201cI told her to remain in the coach!\u201d\nRishe quickly averted her gaze, turning her attention to the wounded knights. They didn\u2019t appear badly injured, yet they all seemed exhausted.\n\u201cExcuse me, can I take a look?\u201d Rishe approached the knight acting as a medic. He looked round, startled by her presence.\n\u201cNonsense, my lady. Don\u2019t trouble yourself, you must have had quite a scare.\u201d\nThis was not unreasonable, but the wariness in his eyes made it clear he wanted her nowhere near his comrade. He isn\u2019t just being polite. He truly is on guard. \nBeside them, an injured knight groaned as another helped him up. \u201cWhat\u2019s wrong with you?\u201d the second knight asked the first. \n\u201cI-I feel\u2026numb.\u201d\n\u201cWhat? Damn.\u201d The knight grabbed up one of the fallen bandit\u2019s swords, going pale as he inspected the blade. \u201cYour Highness, look at this. Poison.\u201d\nArnold clicked his tongue. \u201cLocate every laceration and bind them close to the heart. Suck the poison from the wounds.\u201d\nHe mostly got that right, at least. In the meantime, Rishe located the nearest bound bandit and pulled his dagger out of its sheath. Its wet coating gleamed in the sunlight, just as the knight had said.\nThey applied the poison liberally\u2014whatever it is must be cheap and easily bought in bulk.\nShe wafted the smell toward her, bracing for something rancid, but detected nothing. Then she brought it closer to her nose.\nIt smells sweet, like an overripe apple. Shea grass and\u2026bluecap mushrooms. All the knights appear to have the same symptoms, so I won\u2019t have to check every blade.\nRishe stood back up and headed for the coach.\nOliver took a step after her. \u201cYour Highness, Lady Rishe is\u2014\u201d\n\u201cLeave her. She may do as she pleases.\u201d\n\u201cShe\u2019s well trained,\u201d Oliver mused. \u201cBut a battlefield is no place for a young lady. She probably wasn\u2019t prepared for such a dreadful spectacle.\u201d\nRishe ignored the murmurs and focused on her work. There they are. I\u2019ll take these, these, and\u2026\n\u201cThe poison must be a sleeping drug,\u201d she overheard Arnold saying. \u201cHunters use such drugs to weaken larger prey. I doubt this dose is lethal.\u201d\n\u201cBut it certainly is annoying,\u201d replied Oliver. \u201cWe\u2019re still two days out from Galkhein. Lugging a company of sleeping men in armor won\u2019t be pleasant.\u201d\n\u201cWe\u2019ll have to stop somewhere nearby. A hunter\u2019s settlement. Perhaps they will have an antidote\u2014\u201d\n\u201cExcuse me.\u201d Rishe, who\u2019d returned from the carriage, raised a hand. \u201cI have an antidote.\u201d\n\u201cWhat?\u201d\nThe entire company stared at her in awe.\n \n***\n \nAs it turned out, Arnold\u2019s guess was right. \nThis sweet-smelling substance was a hunter\u2019s drug, made from ingredients that were only toxic in their raw form. Heat rendered them harmless. Rishe had encountered this poison several times before, curing a customer afflicted with it during her life as an apothecary.\n\u201cA lethal dose for a grown man would fill a wine glass. They likely got less than a hundredth of that,\u201d Rishe explained to Arnold, not looking up from her work. \u201cStill, the numbness can block their airways with the roots of their tongues. It\u2019s best to lay them on their sides.\u201d\n\u201cYes, I understand the theory and the solution.\u201d Arnold gazed down at Rishe\u2019s hands. \u201cThe part I\u2019m struggling with is why you\u2019re the one telling me this.\u201d\n\u201cWell, I know how to make the antidote,\u201d Rishe said patiently as she muddled the herbs together in the white soup bowl she\u2019d borrowed for her flowers. She crushed them with the back of a spoon before adding another dried flower, crushing that as well, and combining them to form a paste. This process would be easier with a pestle, but she wasn\u2019t about to complain. \u201cThis poison is common\u2014it\u2019s cheap and easy to make, which often means the antidote is simple as well.\u201d\nThe antidote was synthesized, in fact, when hunters witnessed a deer showing no symptoms after eating a certain mushroom. They tested those along with other common herbs the deer ate. Rishe mentally thanked them for their scientific rigor as she added a bit of water, straining it all through a cloth.\nRishe stood up, brandishing the bowl of bright green medicine. \u201cBoiling would make the antidote more potent, but this works in a pinch.\u201d\nThat was when she noticed the astonished stares. Unsure of what social faux paus she\u2019d perpetrated, she looked away. Oliver was completely stunned. Arnold looked thoughtful. It was imperative the knights were treated as soon as possible, but to Rishe\u2019s dismay, no one was moving. \nDo they not trust me? That makes sense. Anyone would be reluctant to use medicine concocted by a complete stranger. But",
    "query_text": " the longer we wait, the harder the poison will become to cure. \nShe needed to dispel their doubts. Rolling up her sleeve, Rishe approached Arnold and drew his sword from its scabbard. \u201cI need to borrow this for a moment, Your Highness.\u201d\n\u201cWhat are you\u2014\u201d\nShe pushed the blade against the soft skin of her inner arm. Blood welled up, along with the sharp sting of pain. Nothing compared to her injuries sustained during her life as a knight, though.\nArnold did not share her nonchalance. \u201cWhat do you think you\u2019re doing?!\u201d\nHe grabbed"

    "prefix_text": " of the coach. More and more people were gathering to watch their progress, some carrying shopping bags in both arms or holding hands with children. Many of them waved, as if greeting someone dear to them.\nHappy citizens and clean, orderly streets meant wealth. Galkhein was well-off. Rishe couldn\u2019t help but grin at an adorable little girl watching them roll by with sparkling eyes. When she saw Rishe\u2019s smile, she blushed and leapt up in the air, laughing with delight.\nThe coach made its way through the city before passing through the castle gates. Lines of disciplined knights flanked the road, ready to greet the crown prince and his fianc\u00e9e.\nArnold stepped out of the coach, holding out his hand to Rishe. She took it reflexively as she alighted. A prince would be expected to help any lady out of carriage, never mind his own consort, yet for some reason the knights looked a bit disturbed.\nRishe shot them back of look of innocent confusion.\n\u201cOur long journey is at last at its end, Your Highness, Lady Rishe.\u201d Oliver emerged from the ranks of the knights, bowing. He shot Arnold a curious glance. \u201cHow novel to see you taking the hand of your fianc\u00e9e.\u201d\nAh! Rishe realized that she herself had willingly broken the condition that she had imposed. Arnold had offered his hand, but she was the one who accepted.\nArnold gave a little laugh of triumph. Rishe felt a rush of frustration at being tricked. \nOliver stared at them before leaning in to whisper in Arnold\u2019s ear. Arnold let out a breath of annoyance. \n\u201cIs something the matter?\u201d Rishe asked.\n\u201cI sent orders ahead to have a detached wing of the palace prepared for us, but it seems the preparations are behind schedule. I\u2019m sorry, but you\u2019ll need to stay in a guest room in the main palace for a few days.\u201d\n\u201cOh, I don\u2019t mind if the wing isn\u2019t ready,\u201d Rishe said. \u201cWe can head over there now.\u201d\n\u201cIt hasn\u2019t been used in quite a while. It\u2019ll be covered in dust.\u201d\n\u201cI said that I didn\u2019t mind if it was a mess, remember? But there\u2019s no need for you to put yourself out. By all means, stay in the main palace for as long as you need.\u201d Rishe had spent a life as a maid\u2014dust didn\u2019t scare her. \u201cBesides, I\u2019m a hostage, after all.\u201d\n\u201cYou could at least attempt to sound distressed,\u201d Arnold said with the slightest trace of petulance. \nRishe, who had a huge grin spreading over her face and her chest puffed out with pride, didn\u2019t respond.\n \n***\n \nThe detached wing turned out to be just a separate palace in the distant corner of the grounds\u2014a scant four stories tall and, as advertised, absolutely swimming in dust.\nNot so bad, though. Rishe had pictured decay and clutter, but it was mostly just bare. Bare and musty, but not rotten or falling apart.\n\u201cYou can do whatever you want with this place. I\u2019ll be occupied over the next few days, but feel free to use the guest apartments in the main palace if you get tired of choking to death,\u201d Arnold said before he left.\nAccording to Oliver, work had piled up while the prince was away, and it wasn\u2019t just a few things that could be dispensed with over a few days working around the clock.\nEmperor Arnold Hein\u2026 He\u2019s just a crown prince right now, but I still wish I knew what\u2019s going on in his head. For now, I\u2019ll just focus on what I can do. Like make this place livable.\nShe changed into her plainest dress and rolled up her sleeves. The knights who\u2019d remained to serve as her guard kept watch over her as she went from window to window, throwing them all open.\nIn a stroke of luck, the weather was good, and the detached wing was well placed to soak up the sun. The lack of any creature comforts made it look ascetic and drab, but once it was furnished, Rishe had no doubt it would be lovely.\nLeaving the top floors to air out, Rishe found the stairs to the basement. She pushed the heavy wooden doors open, and mice skittered over her feet. The knights yelped as Rishe descended into the darkness.\n\u201cL-Lady Rishe, why are you going down here?\u201d\n\u201cCleaning supplies are usually kept in the basement. See?\u201d\nThe knights followed her gaze to a duster, broom, dustpan, and pile of fresh cloths. She filled a bucket with water and went to work, rolling up a handkerchief to cover her mouth as she swept dust down from high on the walls. Then she swept up all the dust on the floor.\nIt\u2019s always satisfying to tackle a place this filthy.\nShe corralled the dust bunnies until they were piled up like snow in the center of the hall, and then she swept them out the open door. Once the floors were free of debris, she attacked them with the cloth.\n\u201cLady Rishe, is there anything we can do to help?\nRishe was grateful for the knight\u2019s offer, but she shook her head. \u201cYour job is to guard me, not do my housekeeping.\u201d\n\u201cThis is quite the place to clean on your own, detached though it may be,\u201d the knight said hesitantly. \u201cIt\u2019s not too late to move into the guest chambers instead.\u201d\n\u201cThat\u2019s all right. I like the place already.\u201d\nRishe remained steadfast in her refusal for one reason: readying guest chambers was an awful chore. The palace maids would be expected to work overnight to prepare them, even if the guests were only staying a single night. No speck of dust or strand of hair could remain. Certainly no wrinkled sheets. Rishe knew how exhausting and rigorous a maid\u2019s job was, how nerve-racking.\nShe refused to put the poor dears through such an ordeal for just a few days\u2019 stay. From the sound of things, the palace wasn\u2019t equipped with many housemaids. No doubt they already had their hands full.\n\u201cBesides, take a look.\u201d She held out her arms wide, gesturing to her sparkling clean floor. The knights stared at the bright room in admiration. \u201cCleaning a place with your own hands makes living there that much more satisfying, you see.\u201d\nThe knights smiled their awkward but good-natured agreement.\nRishe worked tirelessly, and before long, the chambers where she would spend the night were ready. The knights offered to carry in the bed, which she allowed.\nWhile they brought in furniture, Rishe started cleaning another room. She had run out of clean water, so she quietly slipped out to the well without informing the knights. It wasn\u2019t quite fair to them, but these were the palace grounds. Surely she didn\u2019t need to be chaperoned everywhere.\nBesides, they\u2019re guards in name only. They\u2019re clearly just here to report my movements to Arnold Hein, Rishe reflected as she walked through a courtyard full of flowers, bucket in hand. Iridescent butterflies cavorted playfully around her feet. He doesn\u2019t seem in a hurry to introduce me to the king. Although if I\u2019m just a hostage, that doesn\u2019t surprise me.\nShe hoped she got to meet the current emperor at least once. The future Arnold\u2019s violent conquest only began after he killed the man and made himself emperor, after all.\nI wonder what happened to Arnold Hein after I died in my past life. Did he reign supreme after winning his war? Or did some country manage to put a stop to his conquest? Whatever the case, I absolutely cannot allow him to start a conflict this time. Being the empress of a wartime nation sounds like so much work! The very thought is unacceptable!\nPerhaps they could divorce, but Rishe had a feeling that if Arnold decided to discard her in the middle of a war, she would fail in her mission to make it past the age of twenty. Better to avoid the situation all together.\nWait. When she thought about it, the cause of every single one of Rishe\u2019s deaths was Arnold and his war. I died fighting. I died when Galkhein\u2019s army invaded\u2026\nLooking at her six lives, all of them had ended in more or less the same way.\nRishe found herself crouched on the ground, cradling her head in her hands. Maybe we should get a divorce right now. But it wasn\u2019t in Rishe\u2019s nature to take back her decisions once she\u2019d made them. \nIf I leave, I\u2019ll probably just die in some war-related disaster again. If I can\u2019t live apart from him, I should take this opportunity to learn everything that I can. \nRishe didn\u2019t know the cause of her repeating lives, but there was no guarantee that the loops were infinite. She had to operate under the possibility that this life could be her last. This required some thought, but standing around seething with anxiety wouldn\u2019t help.\nRight now I\u2019ll focus on cleaning. Once the bath is here, I\u2019ll scrub off all the dust and travel exhaustion. And then I can finally relax! \nBrimming with new determination, she stood up and headed for the well. She was forestalled by the sound of jeering giggles. \n\u201cAww, look at the new girl, trying so hard,\u201d said one voice.\n\u201cAll the enthusiasm in the world won\u2019t make a difference,\u201d said another. \u201cWe\u2019re going to be the crown princess\u2019s maids, not you.\u201d\nThe first added, \u201cHey, are you even listening? Stop wasting your time!\u201d\nRishe heard a weak scream, followed by a thump, like a body hitting the ground. She broke into a run, finding a blonde girl sprawled in the dirt, surrounded by four other women.\n\u201cAre you all right?\u201d Rishe hurried over to help the girl up. Her maid\u2019s uniform\u2014a loose navy-blue dress with a white apron\u2014was smeared with mud. The others were dressed identically.\n\u201cWho are you?\u201d one of the girls snapped at Rishe. She had a mop of blazing-red hair. \u201cAnother newbie?\u201d\nAn understandable mistake. Rishe\u2019s dress was simple, free of ornamentation, and her hair was bound back in a ponytail to keep it out of the way. She was dust-streaked, sweaty, and carrying a bucket in her arms.\nTelling them who I am will be more trouble than it\u2019s worth. Her silence only angered the girls more.\n\u201cAre you one of the crown princess\u2019s maids? They\u2019ve been snatching up every new girl. Those pretty hands of yours don\u2019t look like they\u2019ve ever held a broom,\u201d said one of them.\n\u201cUnfortunately for you, we\u2019ve been working here three years, and we\u2019ll be the ones to serve Prince Arnold as the maids of his palace.\u201d\n\u201cCan you stand? Oh, good, it looks like you\u2019re not injured.\u201d Rishe helped the girl up out of the dirt. \n\u201cHey, don\u2019t ignore us!\u201d the redheaded maid shouted. \u201cYou\u2019ve got some nerve. If you want to make it here, you\u2019ll know your place! I doubt the two of you will last a week!\u201d\nRishe didn\u2019t respond, her attention snagging on something else. The redhead was carrying curtains, probably to bring them to the wash. Rishe stared at them so hard the maid began to shift uncomfortably. \u201cWhat\u2019s your problem?\u201d\n\u201cYou should wait to wash those,\u201d Rishe said.\nThe girl glared daggers at her. \u201cExcuse me? Are you telling me it\u2019s too late in the day? You really are an amateur! The light lasts longer in the spring, you know. And it\u2019s hot today. There\u2019ll be plenty of\u2014\u201d \n\u201cIt\u2019s going to rain, is all.\u201d\nThe maids exchanged glances. \u201cHow can you be so sure?\u201d\n\u201cLook at the clouds amassing. The butterflies and the bees are flying low. The moisture in the air will make the drying take longer.\u201d\n\u201cWhat?\u201d\nAnother maid spoke up in a soft voice. \u201cDiana, you were the one who said we should take the initiative to wash the bigger pieces. You said the crown prince would choose us for his household!\u201d\n\u201cStop putting the blame on me! This isn\u2019t my fault.\u201d An indignant flush crept over the redhead\u2019s face. \u201cThere\u2019s no way some upstart can tell what time it\u2019s going to rain! The weather is going to be fantastic all day. Come on, we\u2019re hauling these over to the wash!\u201d\nThe three girls meekly followed Diana.\nRishe sighed, turning to the blonde girl. \u201cAre you hurt?\u201d\n\u201cNo, I\u2019m fine.\u201d The girl\u2019s gaze darted around nervously. \u201cI\u2019m Elsie. Thank you for helping me.\u201d Her face was studiously blank, but from the way she struggled with her words, Rishe could tell she was being genuine.\n\u201cDon\u2019t worry about it,\u201d Rishe said. \u201cYour uniform seems to have fared less well.\u201d\n\u201cOh no.\u201d Elsie looked down at herself. Her face remained vacant, but she seemed sad. \u201cAnd I just got it.\u201d \n\u201cYou can get the dirt out if you wash it straight away. It\u2019s going to rain, but this dress should dry quickly. Use lots of soap, but don\u2019t scrub it by hand\u2014scrape the mud off with a brush.\u201d\n\u201cWhy a brush?\u201d\n\u201cBecause your fingers will just grind dirt into the threads. A brush is more porous.\u201d\nThe young",

She could even salvage dirty socks that had spent days crumpled in the corner.\n\u201cDo you\u2026 Are you\u2026\u201d Elsie trailed off, blinking rapidly a couple of times before finally looking Rishe in the eyes. \u201cAre you the crown princess\u2019s maid?\u201d\nUnsure how to answer, Rishe couldn\u2019t meet her eyes.\n \n***\n \nAfter parting ways with Elsie, Rishe returned to the detached wing with her"

I\u2019m here with a delivery.\u201d\n\u201cJust a moment!\u201d Rishe slipped out of the bed, dressed quickly, and tugged the bed\u2019s canopy closed. She opened the door to find Oliver standing in the hallway with a polite smile.\nHe apologized again. \u201cThis was the only time I could slip away from His Highness\u2019s office. I\u2019m glad to see that you\u2019re already dressed.\u201d\n\u201cNot at all.\u201d Rishe paused, stepping back to allow him inside. \u201cOh my. You look exhausted.\u201d\nOliver grimaced. \u201cIs it that obvious? We\u2019ve been climbing through mountains of paperwork, but never mind me. His Highness has been working around the clock.\u201d\nRishe thought back to yesterday, how he had come all the way out to the balcony. He should have used that spare time to sleep. \u201cHe\u2019s in high demand, isn\u2019t he? He was even working on the trip over.\u201d\n\u201cHe finished all the work he brought along with us,\u201d Oliver confirmed. \u201cNow he\u2019s dealing with everything that piled up during his visit to Hermity.\u201d\n\u201cOh.\u201d Rishe grimaced in sympathy. He may have killed her in a past life, but she wouldn\u2019t wish the bureaucracy of kingship on anyone. \u201cIt\u2019s a shame he had to put his work on hold to attend a silly engagement party.\u201d\n\u201cNo matter. That party was how a committed bachelor finally found a bride.\u201d\nHis smile was sincere, but Rishe knew better. She spread her arms. \u201cGo on. Shall I spin around so you have a better view?\u201d\nOliver blinked. \u201cI beg your pardon?\u201d\n\u201cYou\u2019re looking me over like I\u2019m a horse for sale. If there\u2019s anything I can help you with, please let me know.\u201d\nOliver\u2019s brows went up. He let out a little breath of resignation. \u201cHis Highness was right. You do possess the keen perception of a knight. Of course, I\u2019m purely an amateur myself.\u201d\nI\u2019d say this was a merchant\u2019s sixth sense, rather than battle intuition.\nThis wasn\u2019t the first time Rishe had caught Oliver looking at her. It reminded her of the way her noble customers would examine a product, assessing worth and authenticity. Or a merchant weeding out potential merchandise from a wide array of choices.\nIn other words, he was appraising her.\nOliver moved into a deep, sweeping bow. \u201cMy sincerest apologies, my lady. I have been unaccountably rude to my lord\u2019s consort. My behavior was unacceptable.\u201d\nRishe shook her head. \u201cPlease don\u2019t, it\u2019s fine.\u201d It wasn\u2019t unreasonable for the prince\u2019s closest attendant to be wary of strangers. But it did make her curious. \u201cHow long have you worked for Arnold? Have you always been a valet?\u201d\n\u201cI trained as a squire, actually,\u201d Oliver replied. \u201cBut I was injured and dismissed from the order. His Highness took me into his household soon after. I have served him for nearly a decade.\u201d\n\u201cThen maybe you can answer this,\u201d Rishe said. \u201cWhy is Prince Arnold so very intent on making me his wife?\u201d\nOliver hesitated, as if weighing the pros and cons of speaking, \u201cTo be quite honest, I was as surprised as you were. He\u2019s always insisted he had no interest in marriage. But the sight of you in Hermity has changed his mind. Apparently.\u201d\nSo not even his attendant understood his motives. Rishe remained at a complete loss.\n\u201cIf I may, however?\u201d Oliver mistook Rishe\u2019s confusion for anxiety and added, \u201cI have served Prince Arnold for a long time, and never before have I seen him so happy. When he is with you, he laughs. His smiles are sincere.\u201d\nRishe was taken aback. She\u2019d figured all of Arnold\u2019s laughter and teasing was at her expense. His own private jokes.\n\u201cAre you\u2026unhappy with him?\u201d Oliver ventured. \u201cWith his looks, His Highness is exceedingly popular with the ladies of the court, you know.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m sure he has many admirers.\u201d She paused. \u201cWould you really call the way he acts around me \u2018happy\u2019? To me, it seems more like a cat with a mouse.\u201d\nOliver laughed. He didn\u2019t deny it. \u201cI am pleased you understand His Highness so well. Oh, I nearly forgot. Here.\u201d\nHe held out a sheaf of three documents. \u201cThis is the guest list for your wedding. His Highness bids you look over it.\u201d\n\u201cThank you,\u201d Rishe said, pleasantly surprised. She hadn\u2019t even needed to ask. She gave it a quick glance, quickly identifying the most prominent and powerful names.\nKing Zahad, Prince Kyle, Princess Harriet. And from the Kingdom of Domana, we have Lord Jonal attending as the representative of the king. No surprise there.\nMore than a wedding guest register, this was a list of key people from the countries Arnold would go on to antagonize. Even before the murder of the king and the start of the war, there must have been a trigger\u2014a sea change in the affairs of state. Everyone on this list was most likely involved.\nKing Zahad. I hope we can be friends again like in my first life. Hmm\u2026 Prince Kyle is rather frail. I hope he isn\u2019t working himself too hard. He has a strong sense of responsibility\u2014he\u2019ll attend the wedding even though it\u2019ll be a long trip.\nThe sight of these names filled Rishe with a longing for those lives, for the people she\u2019d once known. And sometime in the very near future, they would all be Galkhein\u2019s enemies.\nIf I take matters into my own hands, perhaps I can salvage some of these relationships before they sour. Even if we aren\u2019t allies, we don\u2019t have to be enemies. Anything to stave off the outbreak of war.\nOliver had no idea what was going through Rishe\u2019s head. Brightly, he continued their conversation. \u201cThe ceremony will be held in three months\u2019 time. All preparations must be complete by then. And now\u2026we need to discuss tonight\u2019s party.\u201d\n\u201cTonight\u2019s what?\u201d\nOliver stiffened. \u201cDid His Highness not tell you?\u201d\n\u201cNo, he most certainly did not! There\u2019s to be a party?\u201d\n\u201cUgh, not again!\u201d Oliver dug his knuckles into his forehead.\nRishe put two and two together. She hesitated, then said, \u201cSo there is one, then. As you must know, His Highness is trying to stamp it down without telling me.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d Oliver replied. \u201cHe should have mentioned it to you. You don\u2019t need to attend, but he will. At least, I hope he will. I think I managed to convince him.\u201d\nShe sympathized with Oliver. Under normal circumstances, it would be unheard of for the crown prince and his fianc\u00e9e to fail to appear at a banquet. \u201cDon\u2019t worry, Oliver. I\u2019ll go.\u201d\nOliver let out a sigh of relief. \u201cReally? Thank you so much, my lady. I\u2019ll put finding you a maid at the top of my to-do list.\u201d\n\u201cNo need.\u201d Rishe smiled. \u201cI can prepare for the party on my own.\u201d\nThis maid-selection process made Rishe uneasy. After witnessing that exchange between the servants in the garden, she imagined quarrels breaking out all through the palace. And she doubted the disputes would go away even after they decided.\nOliver frowned. \u201cBut won\u2019t dressing be difficult without a lady\u2019s maid?\u201d \nShe shook her head. \u201cI can do my hair and put on a gown by myself. I brought dresses and cosmetics from home. Don\u2019t worry.\u201d\nRishe ignored Oliver\u2019s stunned look, already reevaluating her cleaning plans.\n \n***\n \nThe first thing Rishe said to Arnold that night was, \u201cYour Highness, I have a request.\u201d Her gown rustled as she leaned in close. \u201cI would like some herb seed and a corner of the gardens. I made a list. I hope we can discuss this in more detail later.\u201d\nArnold was silent a moment. \u201cRishe.\u201d\n\u201cWhat? Didn\u2019t you tell me to let you know if there was anything I wanted?\u201d She looked at him quizzically, and Arnold sighed.\nShe\u2019d heard that he\u2019d finished his mountain of work and even managed to sleep for a while. He was dressed in his usual military black, trimmed with a red mantle and black gloves.\nArnold shook his head. \u201cThat\u2019s not what I mean. I\u2019m guessing that Oliver didn\u2019t tell you the reason for this party? It\u2019s merely for appearance\u2019s sake. I need to look like I\u2019m searching for a bride within our borders as well. There\u2019s no reason",
    "query_text": " for you to attend.\u201d\nIt made sense. The crown prince\u2014the greatest catch in the kingdom\u2014marrying a foreigner without even the slightest nod to propriety would invite unwanted discontent from the nobility.\n\u201cHowever, we\u2019re betrothed,\u201d Arnold said. \u201cThis whole evening is merely a formality. And with news that you\u2019re my \u2018hostage\u2019 going around, you\u2019ll be an object of curiosity. I don\u2019t want to put you through that.\u201d\n\u201cWell, I already went to the trouble of getting ready.\u201d Rishe plucked at her soft blue dress, draped in fluttering layers around her like a flower bud. She\u2019d braided her hair, decorating it with accessories. Her makeup was light, her"

    "prefix_text": " committing them to memory.\nA wave of sweet perfume wafted over her. A pretty girl with soft blonde hair had appeared at her side. \u201cHow do you do, Lady Rishe? I\u2019m Cornelia Thea Toona.\u201d\nDuke Toona\u2019s family was the thirty-first house she\u2019d met tonight.\nRishe smiled graciously. \u201cRishe Irmgard Weitzner. A pleasure to meet you.\u201d\n\u201cThe pleasure is all mine.\u201d Cornelia smiled sweetly. Her eyes were big and bright, her lips full. She held a glass in each hand and offered one to Rishe. \u201cWine? I see you\u2019re empty-handed.\u201d\nA gaggle of other ladies nearby began giggling among themselves.\n\u201cHow dare she act so haughty when she\u2019s a captive. It\u2019s time for her learn just what she is. A pawn to be played and discarded.\u201d\n\u201cShe should enjoy her time on Prince Arnold\u2019s arm while she can.\u201d\n\u201cShe is from a minor nation, after all.\u201d\nAs Rishe took note of their whispers, Cornelia gazed at her with doe eyes. \u201cDoes my offering offend you in some way?\u201d\nIf I remember correctly, House Toona holds a vast territory in southern Galkhein.\nRishe held out a hand to accept the glass. \u201cHow could it? Thank you, Lady Cornelia.\u201d\nBefore Rishe could touch the glass, Cornelia gave a dramatic shout. \u201cOh dear! My hand slipped!\u201d She dropped it, quite obviously on purpose. Without thinking, Rishe grabbed her skirts and leaned back, plucking the glass out of the air with the other hand.\nCornelia let out a cry of surprise as Rishe caught the wine before any could spill. She swirled the glass and brought it to her nose to breathe in the bouquet.\nHmm\u2026 That\u2019s mashed capsicum. Where did she even get that? What a waste of perfectly good wine. And why bother spicing it enough to singe the tongue if she just planned to ruin my dress? Pick a plan, my dear.\nHiding her exasperation, Rishe smiled brightly. \u201cI\u2019ve never had a wine quite like this. What an unusual scent.\u201d\nCornelia bit her lip in frustration. Rishe beamed at her. You\u2019ve got such a pretty face, Lady Toona. Why don\u2019t you smile?\nRishe leaned in close to Cornelia. \u201cThis vintage isn\u2019t available where I\u2019m from. I\u2019m ever so anxious to learn more. Should I perhaps invite Prince Arnold over to enjoy a glass? Which tray did you get this from?\u201d\n\u201cWhat? Oh, um\u2026\u201d Rishe had a policy of never backing down from a fight, but it seemed Cornelia didn\u2019t share it. \u201cS-sorry, but I don\u2019t remember. Such a large hall, you see.\u201d\n\u201cA shame. I\u2019ll just give His Highness this one, then. I\u2019ll be sure to let him know who it\u2019s from.\u201d\n\u201cUh, wait!\u201d Cornelia rapidly shook her head. \u201cI-I got that glass for you, so I think you should\u2014you know what? Never mind! Maybe I should just take that\u2014oh no!\u201d\nRishe ignored the ashen-faced Cornelia, raising the glass and swallowing down a gulp. \n\u201cI-I can\u2019t believe\u2026\u201d\n\u201cSuch a spicy flavor, just as I imagined.\u201d Rishe smiled again to the assembled group\u2019s astonishment. \u201cWhat a warm welcome. I do hope the two of us can spend more time together. Perhaps\u2026a tea party?\u201d\n\u201cTh-the two of us?\u201d Cornelia stammered.\n\u201cYes. I want to know all about House Toona.\u201d\nCornelia looked flabbergasted, but she recovered herself and nodded.\nThat should do. One of Rishe\u2019s eventual plans required a plot of land in a temperate climate. House Toona\u2019s would likely be perfect, but she needed to confirm a few things with Cornelia. Never back down from a fight. Even further\u2026\nShe recalled the words of her mentor from her days as a merchant.\nDon\u2019t bother with fights you can\u2019t win.\nThe other ladies fled, fearful of this strange girl who gulped down painfully spicy wine like it was nothing. \n \n***\n \nRishe retreated to the empty balcony to enjoy the music, grimacing with every stinging mouthful of wine. She drank it in decreasing sips until Arnold joined her.\n\u201cWhat are you making that face for?\u201d\nRishe swirled the glass. \u201cDon\u2019t worry, it\u2019s not you. It\u2019s just this wine is so spicy.\u201d\n\u201cSpicy? The wine is?\u201d\n\u201cMm. It\u2019s seasoned with capsicum. I barely managed to get that first mouthful down without gagging.\u201d\nArnold swiped the glass from her hand. \u201cDon\u2019t tell me this was a poisoning attempt!\u201d\nRishe clicked her tongue in annoyance at her own lack of vigilance. No one else would be able to grab something from her so easily.\nArnold glared at the wine. \u201cYou don\u2019t need to drink this. I\u2019ll get rid of it.\u201d\n\u201cHey, give that back! They ruined a perfectly good glass of wine because of me. I\u2019m not going to waste it.\u201d She grabbed it back and took another sip, shuddering at the taste.\nArnold glowered. \u201cTell me who did this. I\u2019ll have them executed.\u201d\n\u201cDon\u2019t be ridiculous. You don\u2019t kill people like her\u2014you use them.\u201d Just the tiniest bit of wine to go, but it was getting harder to make herself drink it. She gave the glass a reproachful look, then glanced back at Arnold. \u201cOh, and I owe you an apology.\u201d\n\u201cDo you?\u201d\n\u201cI used your name to defend myself.\u201d The girls had only backed off when she threatened to tattle to Arnold. Rishe found that sort of thing inelegant in the extreme, and she was embarrassed.\nArnold sighed at Rishe\u2019s apologetic bow. \u201cThere\u2019s nothing wrong with a wife invoking her husband\u2019s name.\u201d\nRishe hesitated. \u201cWe\u2019re not married yet.\u201d\n\u201cThat\u2019s a formality. It\u2019s as good as done, if you ask me.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2026see.\u201d\nHe took her distraction as an opportunity to swipe her glass back. Instead of dumping it out, Arnold gulped the rest of it down. \n\u201cDamn, that packs a punch,\u201d he grumbled.\n\u201cI told you that!\u201d Rishe snapped. \u201cAre you all right? Let me get you some water!\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m fine. But now you\u2019ve fulfilled your obligation to the wine, haven\u2019t you?\u201d\nRishe didn\u2019t know what to say. He\u2019d helped her\u2014not by taking charge but by following her lead. Without cutting her down and telling her she was being foolish. Without rolling his eyes and dismissing her desires as trifles.\n\u201cThank you,\u201d Rishe said stiffly, which just made him laugh.\n\u201cWhat were you thinking about when we were dancing?\u201d he asked.\n\u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d\n\u201cYou were thinking about someone else, weren\u2019t you? Who?\u201d\nRishe didn\u2019t know a delicate way to say I was thinking about a future version of you I met in another life.\n\u201cHmm?\u201d His tone was oddly light, teasing even. But the gleam in his hunter\u2019s eyes said she wouldn\u2019t get away so easily.\nObviously, Rishe couldn\u2019t give him an honest answer. \u201cI wasn\u2019t thinking about anyone else. I was worried about you.\u201d\n\u201cWhy?\u201d\nThis was the closest she could come to the truth. \u201cWere you injured here?\u201d She patted her own left shoulder with her forefinger. \nArnold went silent. His left shoulder was slightly slower to react than his right\u2014if his right was at one hundred, then his left was at maybe ninety-eight. It was hardly noticeable, but Rishe had picked up on it. He was right-handed, and she wouldn\u2019t have noticed it if they\u2019d been dancing normally. \nThat, and if it hadn\u2019t been for memories from her past life.\nRishe had only managed to inflict a single injury on him. An instant, a moment\u2019s hesitation where she saw her chance and slashed left. Of course, he\u2019d shrugged off the injury and effortlessly run her through. \n\u201cHeh.\u201d Arnold finally broke his silence with grim laughter. His eyes sent shivers down her spine, cold and bewitching. In lieu of an answer, he reached for his collar, unfastening the clasp with a snap and drawing his jacket open with a rough tug.\nOh my.\nRishe drew in a breath. A great scar was engraved into the nape of his neck, just low enough to be concealed by clothing. It looked several years old. \u201cIt\u2019s an old wound. It continues to the top of my shoulder and pulls the skin taut.\u201d\n\u201cHow awful.\u201d Rishe couldn\u2019t help but reach out to gingerly touch the nape of his neck.\nArnold accepted her touch without a word. She\u2019d half expected to be slapped aside.\nHer fingers slowly traced the shape of it. She could feel the rough skin through her gloves.\nHe must have gotten this over a decade ago. Someone stabbed him\u2014and not just once or twice. They must have done it over and over to make this scar pattern.\nHer medical training had her shuddering at the image of a nine-year-old Arnold ashen and trembling with blood loss. The fact that he\u2019d survived and retained the use of his arm was incredible. And then to go on to wield a sword so skillfully\u2014his suffering must have been immense.\n\u201cOnly a few people know about this injury. You\u2019re the first to notice on your own.\u201d\n\u201cHow did it happen?\u201d\nThat grim smile returned as he looked down at Rishe. With the moon hanging behind him, he was as opaque as ever, but Rishe understood the sentiment.\nI shouldn\u2019t pry.\nRishe pulled her hand away, and that ominous smile that sent chills down her spine disappeared. Arnold put his jacket back in order, reclasping it",

I\u2019m so much better than any of them! I\u2019ll do a perfect job no matter what task you set before me. Please don\u2019t dismiss me, my lady!\u201d \n\u201cListen to me, Diana.\u201d Rishe dropped her lofty tone, speaking as one woman would to another. \u201cYou have noticed it, haven\u2019t you? No matter what you claim, these new girls aren\u2019t worthless.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2026I don\u2019t understand.\u201d\n\u201cCan you remember your first month in service? How difficult it was?\u201d\nDiana looked completely bewildered. Her gaze darted around as if looking for help.\nPulling herself together, she forced herself to follow Rishe\u2019s directions. She thought back and finally alighted on a response. \u201cI\u2026I didn\u2019t know how to do the job. Before, when my family was still prominent, I\u2019d washed shirts and bedsheets. Never gowns or military uniforms.\u201d\n\u201cPerfectly reasonable,\u201d Rishe said. \u201cOnly natural for someone just starting out.\u201d\n\u201cThe older girls were so busy, they told me to just watch them since they didn\u2019t have time to teach me. When I had questions\u2026well, there was nobody to ask.\u201d\n\u201cI bet. And did you have any other problems?\u201d\n\u201cWell, yes. There was a lot to learn. Different kinds of soap and washboards depending on the cloth. You use different tools for different materials. I had to learn how they worked and how to put them away. I was\u2026punished if I didn\u2019t get it right the first time.\u201d\nThe newcomers were exchanging surprised looks. Rishe understood why.\nEverything Diana said was familiar to them. They spent valuable time searching for their materials and the proper ways to use them, but they shrank from asking for help. Everyone always looked so busy. This was a universal problem.\n\u201cDespite all that, I got better!\u201d Diana protested. \u201cI only needed to be taught once. Unlike them! They\u2019re useless!\u201d\n\u201cYes, well. There\u2019s a difference between you and them,\u201d Rishe told Diana. \u201cYou can read and write.\u201d\n\u201cOh!\u201d Diana started in surprise. Elsie looked at the floor.\nThe literacy rate among commoners was low no matter where you went. Very few families had the means to afford an education, especially for daughters. Diana had been born to a merchant\u2019s family\u2014she\u2019d received formal schooling. The maids she was close friends with were likely from similar backgrounds. The majority of those in service were not so fortunate.\n\u201cWhat if you only received instructions on how to do a job once and weren\u2019t able to write it down to remind yourself later?\u201d Rishe asked. \u201cWould you be so confident?\u201d\n\u201cI-I don\u2019t\u2014\u201d Diana reflexively thrust a hand into her apron pocket, where she had a list of daily tasks recorded in her neat handwriting to reference throughout the day. Hopefully now she would understand how much of an edge her privileged literacy gave her over the other maids.\n\u201cEveryone else works as hard as they can, just like you do,\u201d Rishe said. \u201cRemember how it was for you at first? They all have to start somewhere. I hope you\u2019ll keep that in mind.\u201d\n\u201cThey\u2019re no different from me,\u201d Diana mumbled begrudgingly, glancing around the room, looking at the less experienced maids. As if coming to a decision, she said, \u201cI\u2019m sorry.\u201d\n\u201cDiana?\u201d\nLike a child enumerating her regrets, Diana went on, \u201cI\u2019ve done you wrong, all of you. It\u2019s just, I had nothing. Or so it felt like. No money, no title. I thought I had to make my way in the world on my own. That I had to start from zero.\u201d Her shoulders trembled as she buried her face in her hands. \u201cBut I was wrong! I wasn\u2019t starting from zero. I had everything that I learned growing up. I didn\u2019t realize how fortunate I was. I let it all go to my he\n \n\u201cRISHE IRMGARD WEITZNER! You are a vile woman! A truly malicious creature unworthy of the crown prince! As of this instant, our engagement is off!\u201d \n\u201cAs you wish, Your Highness.\u201d\n\u201c\u2026Huh?\u201d\nThe prince\u2019s declaration echoed throughout the ballroom. Rishe, the duke\u2019s daughter, bowed in response, her coral-toned hair swaying gracefully. The assembled guests found themselves captivated by her dignified beauty. Despite having just witnessed a broken engagement, they couldn\u2019t bring themselves to pity her.\nSlowly, Rishe lifted her head and fixed the prince with a pale-emerald gaze. It caught him off guard, but he quickly recovered.\n\u201cDidn\u2019t you hear what I just said?! I\u2019m calling off our engagement! Doesn\u2019t that trouble you?\u201d\n\u201cNot really.\u201d\nRishe already knew what happened next: false accusations, exile, and her family severing all ties and leaving her to survive on her own. She turned from the prince. There was no point wasting any time.\nThis is my seventh loop, after all.\nRishe had done this all before.\nThe next few hours will be busy. I must hurry and retrieve my things before I\u2019m barred from the family estate. I don\u2019t want this to be one of the times I\u2019m too slow and I have to start my new life with nothing.\n\u201cRishe, halt and hear me! I have spent the past week perfecting my recitation of your crimes!\u201d\nI should take more than dresses this time\u2014there\u2019s plenty of things I could use out in the world. What trade should I take up? In my first life, I was a merchant. In my second, an apothecary. I\u2019ve got a few more I want to try out\u2026 Augh! If time\u2019s just going to keep resetting, I wish I could start at an earlier point. I need more time to prepare!\n\u201cWait! Rishe!\u201d\nThe crown prince was on the verge of tears, and the spectators struggled to suppress their snickers. \nA thought occurred to Rishe, and she stopped. She then turned, her eyes gleaming beneath long lashes as she stared down her ex-fianc\u00e9. \u201cAh, Your Highness, I almost forgot.\u201d \n\u201cYes, tell me!\u201d the prince fumed. \u201cLet me guess, you are hurt beyond measure and yet love me still\u2026correct?\u201d\nAs if. Rishe was grateful to be granted her freedom. In fact, she was smiling as she said, \u201cI hope you and Lady Mary are happy together.\u201d\n\u201cWhat?!\u201d\n\u201cMay we both lead fulfilling lives. Farewell!\u201d Rishe lifted the skirts of her evening gown and turned on her heel, departing as briskly as she could.\n\u201cHow do you know about Mary? I haven\u2019t told you I love her!\u201d The prince was shouting something behind her, but she paid him no mind. She had things to do.\nDuring her first loop, the prince\u2019s accusations had shocked her to the core and she\u2014foolishly so\u2014had attempted to defend herself. Now she knew better than to expect the prince to behave reasonably. \nHow will life unfold this time? I\u2019m excited to find out! Rishe fixed her mind on the future.\nThis is my seventh \u201cdo-over.\u201d I\u2019ve led happy and carefree lives before, but this time\u2014this time, I swear I\u2019ll live a long happy and carefree life!\nIn other words, she needed to avoid getting killed. At any cost. \n \n***\n \nIn the first loop, with her engagement broken and her reputation in tatters, Rishe roamed with nothing but the clothes on jewelry. Finding them a good-natured band, she hitched a ride to a neighboring country.\nFrom the merchant caravan, she learned a trade, studying how to procure stock and balance ledgers. Eventually, she set out on her own to travel the world. Her upbringing as a daughter of the nobility meant that, even at fifteen years old, Rishe possessed a keen sense for beauty.\nShe collected things that caught her eye and sold them to whoever found delight in her wares. Before she realized it, she had become a major vendor, employing a full staff. She had even done business with the king of a desert nation and the prince of a frozen country up north. She traveled to many distant places, realizing a dream born from her cossetted former life spent doing nothing but preparing to be queen.\nFive years passed, and just as she had only one country left to visit, Rishe fell victim to the war sweeping across the continent.\nThe next thing she knew, she was fifteen years old again and back at that party, with the prince poised to make his pronouncement.\n\u201cRishe Irmgard Weitzner! You are a vile woman! A truly malicious creature unworthy of the crown prince! As of this instant, our engagement is off!\u201d\nNaturally, she didn\u2019t understand what was going on at first. She looked around. Everything was the same. She stood in the same place wearing the same dress and draped in the same jewelry she\u2019d sold to the caravan.\nWas it a dream? Or was everything that had happened up until then the dream? In her confusion, all she could do was stare.\nRishe hurried out of the ballroom, the impending threat of exile hanging over her and the prince\u2019s entreaties to halt ringing in her ears.\nThis is perfect! Now I can get it right! I\u2019ll grab everything valuable from my room.\nRishe had enjoyed her life as a merchant, but she had always felt a stirring of regret about this night. If only she\u2019d brought some funds from home, she would\u2019ve had the capital to establish her business much sooner!\nSpeaking of this regret always prompted disbelief from her customers, including the king of the desert. \u201cWhat? That\u2019s what you\u2019d want to do over?!\u201d\nWhen she arrived back at home on the night of her second life, Rishe grabbed her jewelry box and as many of the books her late grandmother had left her as she could carry, then made haste to the forest to meet the caravan. But the stop at her house took time, and she missed them completely.\nIn that moment, Rishe made a stark realization. Different choices meant different mistakes. Opening one door would close another.\nAnd so the easy path to a life in commerce was closed to her.\nSure, she could try to build her business from the ground up, but personal connections were almost as essential to being a merchant as business savvy. It just wasn\u2019t realistic without a single acquaintance. \nSorting through her belongings in resignation, she came across a foreign encyclopedia of herbs among her grandmother\u2019s books. Taking it as a sign, Rishe sold her jewels elsewhere and used the funds to cross the sea and pursue the study of medicine.\nFortunately, Rishe retained all her knowledge from her previous life. She remembered that certain expensive herbs could be acquired cheaply in other regions. When word spread of a disease running rampant in a neighboring country, she recalled that too. This foreknowledge proved invaluable, as did her wide travel and exposure to many different teachers with many different points of view.\nAs such, Rishe led a successful life as an apothec",

She saved a feeble prince, synthesized a number of rare medicines with her mercantile knowledge, and thus spent her days in the simple joy of helping those in need.\nUnfortunately, all the joy in the world couldn\u2019t stand up to an epidemic. Thus ended her second life. \nOnce again, she found herself in the moment of her broken engagement, the curtain rising on the third loop. Her next four lives proceeded much the same way. As a skilled lady\u2019s maid, she helped a young noblewoman to a fortuitous marriage. Once, she even disguised herself as a man and became a knight. Every life was worth living,"

Did Lady Rishe just dump him?\u201d\n\u201cWait, but wasn\u2019t he trying to dump her?\u201d\n\u201cCan\u2019t be! Look at her! She doesn\u2019t care at all!\u201d\n\u201cHow dare you nobodies make sport of me?\u201d Dietrich screeched. \u201cI am your prince!\u201d\nTemper aside, Dietrich was a handsome man. He had azure-blue eyes and blond hair\u2014a prince straight out of a picture book. His looks and place in the succession meant a never-ending swarm of women vying for his affections. He was brought up a pampered princeling, never wanting for anything. It manifested in a pompous manner and an overconfidence in his own abilities. Rishe had cautioned him about his attitude before, but he never paid her any mind.\nI\u2019m so glad I don\u2019t have to marry him.\nShe wished she could go back and tell the shocked, scared girl from her first life not to worry about her shattered engagement. Still, she might as well say it all here and now, with the assembled knights and citizens to bear witness.\n\u201cYour Highness, you exist to love and protect your people. It\u2019s unbecoming to speak of them in this manner.\u201d\n\u201cYou\u2019re the unbecoming one!\u201d the prince snapped. \u201cBeg me for forgiveness!\u201d\n\u201cI won\u2019t. Calling off our betrothal is the best course, and I applaud Your Highness for your good sense.\u201d\nNow even the knights were trembling with suppressed mirth. \nDietrich was turning red. \u201cD-don\u2019t laugh at me!\u201d\n\u201cLady Rishe,\u201d came a sweet voice. \u201cAren\u2019t you ashamed of yourself?\u201d \nRishe fought down a groan.\nOut of the crowd stepped a charming, dainty girl. Her big eyes moist with tears, she took her place at Dietrich\u2019s side. \u201cI do not allow the people I care about to be treated so very ill!\u201d \n\u201cWhy, Lady Mary. You\u2019re here.\u201d Rishe sighed. \u201cHow nice.\u201d\nThe young Mary scowled through her tears. Hidden behind her skirts, Dietrich continued to shout his disapproval. \u201cRishe! You\u2019ve brought my beloved Mary to tears! She\u2019s told me everything. How you bullied her, ridiculed her. How you find it amusing to lock her in the classroom overnight! Such a wicked woman could never be queen!\u201d\nNone of that\u2019s true.\nRishe glanced at Mary, who averted her gaze a little awkwardly.\n\u201cMore importantly,\u201d Rishe said, \u201chave you already brought your concerns to my parents, Your Highness?\u201d\n\u201cMore importantly?! I did, if you must know! Your parents are furious. They have vowed to disown you.\u201d\n\u201cAh. Then I\u2019m too late.\u201d Her parents held their reputation above all else. Rishe had little hope of retrieving any of her money or belongings now.\n\u201cWhy are you acting so strangely?\u201d Dietrich sniffed. \u201cAh, I understand. You\u2019re in such shock from this turn of events that\u2014\u201d\n\u201cListen, Dietrich.\u201d In her exasperation, Rishe dropped his title. \u201cI accept your decree. We are no longer engaged. I shall never darken your doorstep again. So\u2026relax a little.\u201d\n\u201cHuh? What are you saying?\u201d\n\u201cSince I was a child, I believed that my only value was in our betrothal. Being engaged to the crown prince was my whole reason for living. I was wrong about that. Only I determine my value\u2014no one else. That\u2019s why I don\u2019t care about this. I\u2019m beyond it.\u201d Rishe made sure to look him directly in the eye as she spoke. \u201cYou are an unnecessary element in my life.\u201d\nDietrich staggered back. His legs seemed to go out from under him, and he crumpled. At that, the knights finally let go of their composure, laughing along with the courtiers.\n\u201cSt-stop!\u201d the prince wailed. \u201cYou are my subjects. This\u2026this shows such flagrant disrespect!\u201d\n\u201cDietrich, don\u2019t pay them any mind,\u201d Lady Mary said. \u201cLady Rishe, is this cruelty necessary?\u201d\n\u201cPerhaps this is a blessing in disguise.\u201d Rishe\u2019s attention moved to Mary, making the girl\u2019s slender shoulders jump. She had no reason to worry; Rishe didn\u2019t bite. \u201cI\u2019ve been wanting the opportunity to speak to you, Lady Mary. You\u2019re strong. I admire you very much.\u201d\n\u201cWhat are you talking about?\u201d\n\u201cYou\u2019re a lovely girl who never fails to smile despite your troubles. You don\u2019t put up walls around your heart, and you do your utmost to put others at ease. Even now, you bravely stand before me to protect the prince.\u201d\nMary\u2019s eyes were wide with confusion. Rishe picked her words carefully, attempting to diminish the girl\u2019s guilty feelings, if only a little. \u201cYou need to marry the prince for your family\u2019s sake, right?\u201d\n\u201cHow do you\u2014?\u201d\nRishe had learned this truth in one of her past lives. Mary was born to a poor family, and she had studied like mad to be accepted into the academy to hunt for a husband. She intended to make sure neither she nor her brothers ever went hungry again.\nShe went on, \u201cRemember this: you are the one in control of your life. Don\u2019t sell it to anyone else. Can you trust a man who so easily discards the woman he\u2019s been engaged to since childhood? Do you truly believe he cares for you?\u201d\nAstonishment bloomed across Mary\u2019s face. She looked over at Dietrich, who hadn\u2019t bothered to stand up. The truth was\u2026within a year, Prince Dietrich would be in prison, his title stripped from him. He would plan a mad coup d\u2019\u00e9tat against the king, attempting to provoke the citizens to war. His plan would be discovered in its early stages, rendering him a laughingstock across the kingdom.\n\u201cYou must shape your future with your own hands\u2014you mustn\u2019t entrust your desires to others.\u201d \n\u201cMy\u2026my desires?\nRishe nodded.\nMary was looking at her like she was speaking a foreign language. \u201cBut I\u2019m their elder sister.\u201d Her voice quivered. \u201cI must endure, no matter what. Otherwise, my brothers will never be happy.\u201d\n\u201cAnd you believe their happiness can only be achieved by sacrificing your own?\u201d\nMary gasped as she gaped at Rishe.\n\u201cYou don\u2019t need to throw away your own future to protect those you love,\u201d Rishe told her. \u201cNo matter what path you choose, never forget that.\u201d\n\u201cMy future?\u201d Mary\u2019s voice went ragged, like she was barely suppressing a wail of pain.\n\u201cI wish you a life where both you and your family can be happy,\u201d said Rishe.\nMary stood frozen in place, eyes gleaming like precious stones. Rishe couldn\u2019t help but admire how pretty she was. She truly did wish her happiness. But right now, she needed to take care of herself. \n\u201cWell.\u201d Rishe suddenly broke into a smile, making Dietrich flinch. \u201cI think it\u2019s time for me to be on my way.\u201d\nShe regretted losing access to her room, but she knew her parents wouldn\u2019t let her in. Turning her back on the crowd, Rishe contemplated her next move.\n\u201cWait, Lady Rishe!\u201d Mary\u2019s voice rang out.\n\u201cThat\u2019s right. You\u2019re not going anywhere, Rishe!\u201d The prince joined her. \u201cYou won\u2019t get away with treating me like trash to relieve your own injured heart.\u201d\n\u201cUgh, enough already!\u201d Rishe\u2019s patience was fraying. \u201cI don\u2019t have anything else to say to you. Goodbye!\u201d\n\u201cKnights, stop her!\u201d\nReluctantly, the knights moved to tail Rishe as she walked briskly back down the path. She sympathized with them, but she wasn\u2019t about to let them keep her here. Rounding a corner, she sensed something uncanny. She stopped, the knights quickly catching up with her.\n\u201cMy apologies, Lady Rishe. If you could please remain for just a\u2014whoa!\u201d\nRishe grabbed the hilt of the knight\u2019s sword. Yanking it from his belt, she spun around and stood at the ready. Metal rang against metal as Rishe parried a blow. She glared at her would-be attacker as he stepped out of the shadows.\nArnold Hein!\n\u201cWell, what do you know.\u201d The man smiling so sweetly while their swords locked was the very man who had ended her life. \u201cYou do have some skill.\u201d\nMetal screeched and slid, before Arnold sheathed his sword. Rishe lowered hers. Neither looked away.\n\u201cWho the hell are you?\u201d demanded one of the knights.\n\u201cStand down, good sirs,\u201d Rishe said. \u201cYour interference will only make this worse.\u201d\nThis mostly served to befuddle the knights further. Rishe absolutely couldn\u2019t allow them to come to blows with the crown prince of a friendly nation. And they couldn\u2019t beat him\u2014not even if they took him all at once. Rishe had blocked his blow, but her arm was completely numb. To think he\u2019d be even more powerful in five years.\nHe regarded her unabashedly. \u201cRishe, was that your name? Where did you learn such swordsmanship?\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m afraid I cannot say. Besides, you were clearly going easy on me.\u201d\n\u201cHa! You could tell?\u201d\nArnold\u2019s manner was throwing her off. He seemed to be enjoying himself. He\u2019s laughing. This monstrous prince is\u2026actually laughing.\nWhen she had met him in her other life, he was cold and merciless, like a genuine monster. And yet here he stood, mellow and smiling.\nThe Emperor Arnold Hein I knew was twenty-four years old, so he\u2019s, what? Nineteen now? This is so weird. He\u2019s grinning like a boy getting into a scrape.\nThat attack had been good-natured as well, almost playful. It had muscle behind it but certainly not any lethal intent. He\u2019d just wanted to force Rishe to catch the blow. She found it unbelievable that he could exude such an overpowering air of menace when he was just messing around.\nWhile Rishe was focused on Arnold, Mary and Dietrich caught up, seemingly recovered.\n\u201cExcuse me, my lord!\u201d Mary squeaked. \u201cI-I-I don\u2019t know who you are, but kindly step away from Lady Rishe!\u201d\n\u201cYes, do as she says! Who the hell are you, anyway?!\u201d\nDon\u2019t tell me Prince Dietrich doesn\u2019t recognize one of his personal guests.\nDietrich\u2019s interests did not lean toward diplomacy; he likely hadn\u2019t bothered to introduce himself to Arnold. Mary, for her part, seemed to grasp that Arnold wasn\u2019t ordinary. She stood up to defend Rishe, despite the tremble in her voice. In a better world, perhaps the two of them could have become friends.\n\u201cThat\u2019s your ex-fianc\u00e9?\u201d Arnold cocked a brow. \u201cHe\u2019s even worse than I imagined. Pathetic.\u201d\nDietrich flushed. \u201cI\u2019ll have your head!\u201d\n\u201cDietrich, I beg of you, contain yourself,\u201d Rishe said, then rounded on Arnold. \u201cAs for you, Your Highness\u2014you know who Dietrich is, and you know what speaking carelessly could mean",
    "query_text": ". Are you trying to pick a fight?\u201d\n\u201cWhatever do you mean?\u201d Arnold\u2019s brows lifted high, making him the picture of innocence. \u201cBelieve me, Lady Rishe, every word I speak is chosen with extreme care.\u201d\nFinally realizing who Arnold was, Dietrich visibly paled. \u201cArnold? He\u2019s the crown prince of Galkhein?\u201d\nMary yelped. The knights stood down, shamefaced. The gossip-hungry neighbors who\u2019d gathered to witness a scandal play out drew back in fear.\n\u201cHe\u2019s the"

A genuine coup by patricide, not at all like Dietrich\u2019s clumsy attempt. Next, he would name himself emperor, take control of the country, and mobilize the military.\nSeparating him from his parents will make the first step more difficult\u2014although not impossible, unfortunately.\n\u201cAnything else?\u201d Arnold asked. \u201cI\u2019ll do whatever it takes to marry you.\u201d\n\u201cIdeally, I\u2019d like to know your endgame,\u201d Rishe said with dignity. \u201cBut as I doubt there\u2019s any chance of that, I have one final request.\u201d She jabbed a finger into his face, regardless of how rude it was. \u201cI will spend my time idling around the castle. No work, no study. I shall be utterly useless.\u201d\nLet\u2019s see just how much you want me as your princess.\nAfter a long moment of silence, Arnold cracked a merry laugh. The proposal remained; all her conditions were met.\n\n(2) chapter number given is likely out of range: 0\nChapter: 7\n\nChapter 2\nChapter 2\n \n\u201cYOU KNOW, it was only after I went into commerce that I truly had a dream for the future,\u201d Rishe had once confided in a friend. \u201cUp until then, I existed only as the crown prince\u2019s fianc\u00e9e or my father\u2019s daughter. My every act was to become more worthy of that status. But now, for the first time, I actually have a goal of my own.\u201d\n\u201cOh, yeah?\u201d her friend said. He was the ruler of the desert kingdom, and his smile was awfully charming. \u201cWhat\u2019s that?\u201d\nRishe smiled back. \u201cI want to travel to every single country in the world. I want to see everything in every town, peruse their markets, and meet the eyes of every person who lives there!\u201d\nBy now, that felt like such a distant dream.\n \n***\n \nRishe awoke with a start, eyes snapping open as she sensed a disturbance in the air.\nShe unsheathed her sword halfway, primed for danger. \nInside the coach, her old enemy sat across from her, one hand outstretched. \u201cWhat do you think you\u2019re doing?\u201d she demanded.\nWhen they\u2019d boarded the coach, Rishe had warned him not to lay a single finger on her throughout the trip to his kingdom. Ordering the prince not to touch his consort was absurd, but Arnold readily agreed. He had, after all, promised to follow her every direction.\nAnd yet, here he was, already breaking his promise.\nArnold appeared unperturbed by her glare. \u201cDon\u2019t look at me like that. I was merely trying to recover what you took from me.\u201d\nConfused, Rishe looked at the sword in her hand. It had a black lacquered scabbard with a simple golden decoration. Engraved on the hilt was the Galkhein crest.\n\u201cOh!\u201d Rishe thrust the sword back at Arnold. \u201cMy apologies.\u201d\nArnold chuckled. \u201cYou caught me off guard. You were nodding off, and then you suddenly snatched up my sword. You looked quite content snuggling up with it.\u201d\nArnold propped the sword beside him. Rishe pressed a hand to her chest to quell her racing heart. The sword that gutted me in my previous life is now my bedmate. What a world. Her recent stint as a knight had left her ill at ease without a blade at hand. She just couldn\u2019t believe it was Arnold\u2019s she\u2019d reached for.\n\u201cI didn\u2019t mean to disturb you, but I doubted sleeping with a weapon would be comfortable. I\u2019m impressed you sensed my intent before I even touched you.\u201d Arnold rested one elbow against the window frame, watching her with shameless fascination. \u201cOne only develops instincts like that from combat training. And you were also a member of the court? How in the world did you find the time?\u201d\nRishe shrugged. She couldn\u2019t just say, I pretended to be a man in a previous life, that\u2019s how.\n\u201cI assume there\u2019s more to you than your devotion to the sword. You seem to like flowers.\u201d\nShe followed Arnold\u2019s gaze to where she\u2019d bundled a small bouquet in a handkerchief. This was their fifth day on the road to Galkhein. Every day, without fail, she\u2019d picked flowers whenever they stopped to water the horses. The ones from today were still fresh, but the ones she\u2019d begun drying five days ago were just about ready.\n\u201cI didn\u2019t pick these because they\u2019re pretty.\u201d Rishe brought the blooms to her face, spirits rising at their sweet scent. Spring wildflowers had a soft and gentle smell. Rishe looked out the window at the forest spreading toward Galkhein, thinking of the rare native flowers going into bloom. She wished she could pick those as well, but that would cause too much delay. She gazed on wistfully.\nAfter watching her in silence for some time, Arnold said, \u201cBy the way, I sent one of my men ahead on a fast horse to deliver your order to the company you requested. They\u2019ll be invited to Galkhein to discuss the wedding ceremony.\u201d\n\u201cThank you,\u201d Rishe said. \u201cI\u2019m glad you kept your word.\u201d\n\u201cThe Aria Trading Company,\u201d Arnold mused. \u201cI\u2019ve heard of them. They\u2019re up-and-comers, aren\u2019t they? Have you done business with them before?\u201d\n\u201cNo, but I heard from a friend that they hold a very high standard of quality.\u201d\nRishe was pleasantly surprised at how easily Arnold had acceded to her request. Typically, a royal household had their own personal dealer. Getting them to do business with someone else could be difficult.\nI want to establish a connection with Aria as soon as possible, Rishe thought. It",
    "query_text": " was, of course, the company that had taken her in during her first life.\nThe company had been established just two years prior to picking her up by its owner, a man named Tully. They were still in their growth stage, but in just a few years, they would be the grandest trading company in all the world. They\u2019d proven a great boon in her life as an apothecary as well, helping to distribute her newest medicines. She\u2019d struggled to win their trust initially, but she pledged to work much harder this time around.\nThis marriage isn\u2019t going to happen\u2014I need an escape plan for when it all falls apart. I must bring to bear all my knowledge and influence as a crown princess.\nRishe didn\u2019t know Arnold\u2019s plans, but she had no intention of sitting around and waiting for him to use her as he pleased. She\u2019d spend her time as his consort wisely. Everything must serve her ultimate goal: to live longer than five years"

    "prefix_text": " in handy,\u201d Rishe finished for him.\nGalkhein was an expansionist empire. Currently, peace reigned\u2014but peace was precarious. If Galkhein demanded any of the countries to hand over a princess bride, then none were in a position to refuse. With his daughter in the hands of a foreign power, no king would dare oppose a war that power cared to wage.\n\u201cI sent a message to my father telling him I happened upon a close relation of Hermity\u2019s king\u2014a duke\u2019s daughter who had been recently tossed aside by her fianc\u00e9e,\u201d Arnold said. \u201cI also may have implied I was the reason for your falling out\u2014yours and the prince\u2019s. Why, when I saw a woman so powerful and connected and beloved, I couldn\u2019t help but plunder you.\u201d\n\u201cPlunder me? That\u2019s certainly one way to describe it.\u201d Dietrich had kicked up an almighty fuss, despite being the one who broke the engagement.\n\u201cMy father approves of you because he sees you as a bargaining chip. There will be others who aren\u2019t prepared to accept you so willingly.\u201d\n\u201cIs that so?\u201d Rishe said steadily.\n\u201cNever fear,\u201d Arnold responded. \u201cThey\u2019ll eat their words, every one of them. They will receive you as their crown princess if they value their\u2014\u201d\n\u201cNo, being a hostage is perfect.\u201d \nArnold stared at her. \u201cHm?\u201d\n\u201cAs a hostage, I\u2019ll have no official duties, will I? We can pretend I\u2019m here only under great duress, and there will be no need for my comment on governmental or diplomatic affairs.\u201d\nArnold hesitated. \u201cI suppose not.\u201d\n\u201cExcellent! Then I can live my dream of being utterly useless.\u201d Rishe trembled with delight. The thought of acting as an ambassador had really been weighing on her mind. Being a princess was nonstop work. Having been groomed for the position from an early age, Rishe knew members of the royal family barely even had time to sleep.\nBut prisoners didn\u2019t have places in government.\n\u201cThis is such a weight off my mind,\u201d Rishe admitted. \u201cThank you so much for keeping your promise, Your Highness.\u201d\n\u201cEr, of course.\u201d\n\u201cBut don\u2019t worry, I won\u2019t shirk my duties as wedding planner.\u201d Nearly ready to collapse with relief, Rishe returned to her herbs.\n \n***\n \nAfter the bandit incident, Rishe felt the knights begin to ease a bit in her presence.\nDespite their initial reluctance to accept her help, they continued to report the injured men\u2019s progress and bring any concerns directly to her. In return, they took over gathering herbs from the surrounding countryside on their rest stops.\nShe hadn\u2019t done it for gratitude, but she was nonetheless touched. Gathering medicinal herbs had been second nature ever since her life as an apothecary, and it was foolish to ever turn down loyalty.\nSeveral days after the altercation with the bandits, the coach train finally arrived in the imperial capital of Galkhein.\n\u201cOh my,\u201d Rishe murmured as they passed through the gates.\nWhite stone buildings stood in straight rows, lining clean, orderly streets. The first stories all appeared to be shops, while the second-floor windows were festooned with flowers. Everywhere she looked were smiling faces, citizens turned out to witness their prince\u2019s return over the smooth brick roads. Overlooking it all was the towering magnificence of the imperial palace.\n\u201cThe capital is the seat of power in Galkhein,\u201d Arnold explained. \u201cSeveral key trade routes converge here.\u201d\nRishe nodded, suddenly anxious to be out of the coach. More and more people were gathering to watch their progress, some carrying shopping bags in both arms or holding hands with children. Many of them waved, as if greeting someone dear to them.\nHappy citizens and clean, orderly streets meant wealth. Galkhein was well-off. Rishe couldn\u2019t help but grin at an adorable little girl watching them roll by with sparkling eyes. When she saw Rishe\u2019s smile, she blushed and leapt up in the air, laughing with delight.\nThe coach made its way through the city before passing through the castle gates. Lines of disciplined knights flanked the road, ready to greet the crown prince and his fianc\u00e9e.\nArnold stepped out of the coach, holding out his hand to Rishe. She took it reflexively as she alighted. A prince would be expected to help any lady out of carriage, never mind his own consort, yet for some reason the knights looked a bit disturbed.\nRishe shot them back of look of innocent confusion.\n\u201cOur long journey is at last at its end, Your Highness, Lady Rishe.\u201d Oliver emerged from the ranks of the knights, bowing. He shot Arnold a curious glance. \u201cHow novel to see you taking the hand of your fianc\u00e9e.\u201d\nAh! Rishe realized that she herself had willingly broken the condition that she had imposed. Arnold had offered his hand, but she was the one who accepted.\nArnold gave a little laugh of triumph. Rishe felt a rush of frustration at being tricked. \nOliver stared at them before leaning in to whisper in Arnold\u2019s ear. Arnold let out a breath of annoyance. \n\u201cIs something the matter?\u201d Rishe asked.\n\u201cI sent orders ahead to have a detached wing of the palace prepared for us, but it seems the preparations are behind schedule. I\u2019m sorry, but you\u2019ll need to stay in a guest room in the main palace for a few days.\u201d\n\u201cOh, I don\u2019t mind if the wing isn\u2019t ready,\u201d Rishe said. \u201cWe can head over there now.\u201d\n\u201cIt hasn\u2019t been used in quite a while. It\u2019ll be covered in dust.\u201d\n\u201cI said that I didn\u2019t mind if it was a mess, remember? But there\u2019s no need for you to put yourself out. By all means, stay in the main palace for as long as you need.\u201d Rishe had spent a life as a maid\u2014dust didn\u2019t scare her. \u201cBesides, I\u2019m a hostage, after all.\u201d\n\u201cYou could at least attempt to sound distressed,\u201d Arnold said with the slightest trace of petulance. \nRishe, who had a huge grin spreading over her face and her chest puffed out with pride, didn\u2019t respond.\n \n***\n \nThe detached wing turned out to be just a separate palace in the distant corner of the grounds\u2014a scant four stories tall and, as advertised, absolutely swimming in dust.\nNot so bad, though. Rishe had pictured decay and clutter, but it was mostly just bare. Bare and musty, but not rotten or falling apart.\n\u201cYou can do whatever you want with this place",
    "query_text": ". I\u2019ll be occupied over the next few days, but feel free to use the guest apartments in the main palace if you get tired of choking to death,\u201d Arnold said before he left.\nAccording to Oliver, work had piled up while the prince was away, and it wasn\u2019t just a few things that could be dispensed with over"

    "prefix_text": "I\u2019m the one who decides what I value.\u201d\nRishe had clawed free of her mother and father\u2019s indoctrination a long time ago. Man, woman\u2014it didn\u2019t matter. She could do anything. Being queen was not the culmination of her life; she wouldn\u2019t trade her freedom for anything.\nArnold matched her intensity. \u201cYou\u2019re right.\u201d He gently cupped her cheek in a one hand, swiping his thumb along the line of her jaw, smearing dust. \u201cLive your life here however you wish. I vow to do my utmost to protect you.\u201d\n\u201cHuh?\u201d\nHis vehemence took her by surprise. Arnold had every right to demand she act the part of a proper consort. This was a political marriage; Rishe was essentially a hostage, after all. Yet here he was, cosigning her misbehavior. Moreover, he was all but swearing to defend her from the consequences.\n\u201cWhy?\u201d\n\u201cYou know why. I\u2019m enamored with you.\u201d Arnold fed her the same line. \u201cI know you said you don\u2019t care about other people\u2019s approval, but I like your asymmetrical talents. I don\u2019t find them useless at all.\u201d \nRishe didn\u2019t know how to respond.\n\u201cI thought I\u2019d already made that clear.\u201d He took his hand back, drawing away, stopping just on the threshold. He turned back to a stunned Rishe and said, \u201cLet me know if there\u2019s anything you desire. I realize I just broke our agreement\u2014the one about not touching you.\u201d\nAnd with that, he was gone.\nShaken, Rishe sank to the floor of the balcony. I can\u2019t predict him at all! Just what is Arnold Hein planning?\nThe quiet of evening fell over the imperial capital of Galkhein.\n \n***\n \n\u201cMmm.\u201d\nSunshine streamed through the window as Rishe roused from sleep. She rolled over, basking in the morning light. The wall she expected wasn\u2019t there, and the bed seemed larger than usual. Taking advantage of it, she stretched out as far as she could.\nWas this her chamber at home? Or maybe she was a merchant again, spending a night at the desert king\u2019s palace. Perhaps this was her bed of straw from her life as a maid? Her memories met and interwove as she drifted into wakefulness.\nWhen Rishe finally opened her eyes, she grew even more confused.\nLight blue curtains surrounded the bed, thin enough to allow sunlight to pass through. She pulled them aside to find herself in a bare room devoid of furniture and carpet.\nOh, right. She didn\u2019t need to report for morning training, tend to her herb garden, prepare breakfast, or see how the bottles she had brewed overnight were coming along.\nRealizing that, Rishe buried her face in the pillow. \u201cSo soft,\u201d she murmured. \nJudging by the position of the sun, it was about six o\u2019clock in the morning. She was pretty sure she had gone to bed around midnight last night.\nI slept for six whole hours? Rishe couldn\u2019t believe it. Generally, she was used to getting about four hours of sleep. On bad days, at the height of an emergency as a knight or apothecary, she wouldn\u2019t even get that much. \nI\u2019ve got nothing but cleaning on the schedule today. Hostages can sleep in, right? At least a little? Excitement suffused her at the thought, but that was interrupted by a knock on the door.\n\u201cLady Rishe, are you awake? It\u2019s Oliver\u2014Prince Arnold\u2019s attendant.\u201d\nRishe sat up with a start. \u201cI\u2019m awake!\u201d\nOliver continued to speak through the door. \u201cI apologize for bothering you at such an early hour. I\u2019m here with a delivery.\u201d\n\u201cJust a moment!\u201d Rishe slipped out of the bed, dressed quickly, and tugged the bed\u2019s canopy closed. She opened the door to find Oliver standing in the hallway with a polite smile.\nHe apologized again. \u201cThis was the only time I could slip away from His Highness\u2019s office. I\u2019m glad to see that you\u2019re already dressed.\u201d\n\u201cNot at all.\u201d Rishe paused, stepping back to allow him inside. \u201cOh my. You look exhausted.\u201d\nOliver grimaced. \u201cIs it that obvious? We\u2019ve been climbing through mountains of paperwork, but never mind me. His Highness has been working around the clock.\u201d\nRishe thought back to yesterday, how he had come all the way out to the balcony. He should have used that spare time to sleep. \u201cHe\u2019s in high demand, isn\u2019t he? He was even working on the trip over.\u201d\n\u201cHe finished all the work he brought along with us,\u201d Oliver confirmed. \u201cNow he\u2019s dealing with everything that piled up during his visit to Hermity.\u201d\n\u201cOh.\u201d Rishe grimaced in sympathy. He may have killed her in a past life, but she wouldn\u2019t wish the bureaucracy of kingship on anyone. \u201cIt\u2019s a shame he had to put his work on hold to attend a silly engagement party.\u201d\n\u201cNo matter. That party was how a committed bachelor finally found a bride.\u201d\nHis smile was sincere, but Rishe knew better. She spread her arms. \u201cGo on. Shall I spin around so you have a better view?\u201d\nOliver blinked. \u201cI beg your pardon?\u201d\n\u201cYou\u2019re looking me over like I\u2019m a horse for sale. If there\u2019s anything I can help you with, please let me know.\u201d\nOliver\u2019s brows went up. He let out a little breath of resignation. \u201cHis Highness was right. You do possess the keen perception of a knight. Of course, I\u2019m purely an amateur myself.\u201d\nI\u2019d say this was a merchant\u2019s sixth sense, rather than battle intuition.\nThis wasn\u2019t the first time Rishe had caught Oliver looking at her. It reminded her of the way her noble customers would examine a product, assessing worth and authenticity. Or a merchant weeding out potential merchandise from a wide array of choices.\nIn other words, he was appraising her.\nOliver moved into a deep, sweeping bow. \u201cMy sincerest apologies, my lady. I have been unaccountably rude to my lord\u2019s consort. My behavior was unacceptable.\u201d\nRishe shook her head. \u201cPlease don\u2019t, it\u2019s fine.\u201d It wasn\u2019t unreasonable for the prince\u2019s closest attendant to be wary of strangers. But it did make her curious. \u201cHow long have you worked for Arnold? Have you always been a valet?\u201d\n\u201cI trained as a squire, actually,\u201d Oliver replied. \u201cBut I was injured and dismissed from the order. His Highness took me into his household soon after. I have served him for nearly a decade.\u201d\n\u201cThen maybe you can answer this,\u201d Rishe said. \u201cWhy is Prince Arnold so very intent on making me his wife?\u201d\nOliver hesitated, as if weighing the pros and cons of speaking, \u201cTo be quite honest, I was as surprised as you were. He\u2019s always insisted he had no interest in marriage. But the sight of you in Hermity has changed his mind. Apparently.\u201d\nSo not even his attendant understood his motives. Rishe remained at a complete loss.\n\u201cIf I may, however?\u201d Oliver mistook Rishe\u2019s confusion for anxiety and added, \u201cI have served Prince Arnold for a long time, and never before have I seen him so happy. When he is with you, he laughs. His smiles are sincere.\u201d\nRishe was taken aback. She\u2019d figured all of Arnold\u2019s laughter and teasing was at her expense. His own private jokes.\n\u201cAre you\u2026unhappy with him?\u201d Oliver ventured. \u201cWith his looks, His Highness is exceedingly popular with the ladies of the court, you know.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m sure he has many admirers.\u201d She paused. \u201cWould you really call the way he acts around me \u2018happy\u2019? To me, it seems more like a cat with a mouse.\u201d\nOliver laughed. He didn\u2019t deny it. \u201cI am pleased you understand His Highness so well. Oh, I nearly forgot. Here.\u201d\nHe held out a sheaf of three documents. \u201cThis is the guest list for your wedding. His Highness bids you look over it.\u201d\n\u201cThank you,\u201d Rishe said, pleasantly surprised. She hadn\u2019t even needed to ask. She gave it a quick glance, quickly identifying the most prominent and powerful names.\nKing Zahad, Prince Kyle, Princess Harriet. And from the Kingdom of Domana, we have Lord Jonal attending as the representative of the king. No surprise there.\nMore than a wedding guest register, this was a list of key people from the countries Arnold would go on to antagonize. Even before the murder of the king and the start of the war, there must have been a trigger\u2014a sea change in the affairs of state. Everyone on this list was most likely involved.\nKing Zahad. I hope we can be friends again like in my first life. Hmm\u2026 Prince Kyle is rather frail. I hope he isn\u2019t working himself too hard. He has a strong sense of responsibility\u2014he\u2019ll attend the wedding even though it\u2019ll be a long trip.\nThe sight of these names filled Rishe with a longing for those lives, for the people she\u2019d once known. And sometime in the very near future, they would all be Galkhein\u2019s enemies.\nIf I take matters into my own hands, perhaps I can salvage some of these relationships before they sour. Even if we aren\u2019t allies, we don\u2019t have to be enemies. Anything to stave off the outbreak of war.\nOliver had no idea what was going through Rishe\u2019s head. Brightly, he continued their conversation. \u201cThe ceremony will be held in three months\u2019 time. All preparations must be complete by then. And now\u2026we need to discuss tonight\u2019s party.\u201d\n\u201cTonight\u2019s what?\u201d\nOliver stiffened. \u201cDid His Highness not tell you?\u201d\n\u201cNo, he most certainly did not! There\u2019s to be a party?\u201d\n\u201cUgh, not again!\u201d Oliver dug his knuckles into his forehead.\nRishe put two and two together. She hesitated, then said, \u201cSo there is one, then. As you must know, His Highness is trying to stamp it down without telling me.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d Oliver replied. \u201cHe should have mentioned it to you. You don\u2019t need to attend, but he will. At least, I hope he will. I think I managed to convince him.\u201d\nShe sympathized with Oliver. Under normal circumstances, it would be unheard of for the crown prince and his fianc\u00e9e to fail to appear at a banquet. \u201cDon\u2019t worry, Oliver. I\u2019ll go.\u201d\nOliver let out a sigh of relief. \u201cReally? Thank you so much, my lady. I\u2019ll put finding you a maid at the top of my to-do list.\u201d\n\u201cNo need.\u201d Rishe smiled. \u201cI can prepare for the party on my own.\u201d\nThis maid-selection process made Rishe uneasy. After witnessing that exchange between the servants in the garden, she imagined quarrels breaking out all through the palace. And she doubted the disputes would go away even after they decided.\nOliver frowned. \u201cBut won\u2019t dressing be difficult without a lady\u2019s maid?\u201d \nShe shook her head. \u201cI can do my hair and put on a gown by myself. I brought dresses and cosmetics from home. Don\u2019t worry.\u201d\nRishe ignored Oliver\u2019s stunned look, already reevaluating her cleaning plans.\n \n***\n \nThe first thing Rishe said to Arnold that night was, \u201cYour Highness, I have a request.\u201d Her gown rustled as she leaned in close. \u201cI would like some herb seed and a corner of the gardens. I made a list. I hope we can discuss this in more detail later.\u201d\nArnold was silent a moment. \u201cRishe.\u201d\n\u201cWhat? Didn\u2019t you tell me to let you know if there was anything I wanted?\u201d She looked at him quizzically, and Arnold sighed.\nShe\u2019d heard that he\u2019d finished his mountain of work and even managed to sleep for a while. He was dressed in his usual military black, trimmed with a red mantle and black gloves.\nArnold shook his head. \u201cThat\u2019s not what I mean. I\u2019m guessing that Oliver didn\u2019t tell you the reason for this party? It\u2019s merely for appearance\u2019s sake. I need to look like I\u2019m searching for a bride within our borders as well. There\u2019s no reason for you to attend.\u201d\nIt made sense. The crown prince\u2014the greatest catch in the kingdom\u2014marrying a foreigner without even the slightest nod to propriety would invite unwanted discontent from the nobility.\n\u201cHowever, we\u2019re betrothed,\u201d Arnold said. \u201cThis whole evening is merely a formality. And with news that you\u2019re my \u2018hostage\u2019 going around, you\u2019ll be an object of curiosity. I don\u2019t want to put you through that.\u201d\n\u201cWell, I already went to the trouble of getting ready.\u201d Rishe plucked at her soft blue dress, draped in fluttering layers around her like a flower bud. She\u2019d braided her hair, decorating it with accessories. Her makeup was light, her shoes polished to a mirror shine. Her only jewelry was a pair of pearl earrings.\n\u201cRishe\u2026\u201d\n\u201cYour Highness, the court may consider my status as a captive princess shameful in the extreme, but I don\u2019t.\u201d She\u2019d chosen this course, after all.\nArnold was again watching her with a mixture of wonder and confusion.\n\u201cSo don\u2019t worry,\u201d she said, extending her hand. \u201cFeel free to show off your fianc\u00e9e.\u201d\nArnold relented, his dashing smile creeping out once again. \u201cVery well. I should take advantage of this opportunity to touch my betrothed.\u201d\n\u201cWe\u2019re wearing gloves.\u201d\nArnold took Rishe\u2019s hand.\nA throng of guests was gathered in the ballroom as a group of musicians performed on a platform. Women in gowns stood clustered, while gentlemen in military attire grouped together. A mere glance was enough to tell their clothes were of the highest quality. They mingled happily, making small talk with glasses in hand.\nRishe let her hand rest on Arnold\u2019s arm as she paused at the threshold to take it all in. \u201cThis is a bigger event than I was expecting.\u201d\n\u201cIs it? I\u2019d say it\u2019s a rather small gathering, actually.\u201d\n\u201cMaybe for a military powerhouse,\u201d Rishe muttered. \nYet another reminder of Galkhein\u2019s wealth took her off guard. Arnold just looked bored.\n\u201cThe size doesn\u2019t matter,\u201d he said. \u201cIn the end, they\u2019re only here for gossip. Look, here they come.\u201d\nIn the blink of an eye, they were surrounded by guests.\n\u201cPrince Arnold, thank you for gracing us with an invitation,\u201d said one man. \u201cSuch a pleasure.\u201d \n\u201cThe pleasure is mine, Lord Abel,\u201d Arnold drawled.\n\u201cYour Highness! We were so glad to hear of your safe return,\u201d another guest chirped. \u201cPlease, our daughter is simply dying to be regaled with tales of your trip.\u201d\n\u201cI can\u2019t imagine I\u2019d have anything particularly exciting to share with her,\u201d Arnold said curtly.\nAfter the last few days, Rishe found this look of glazed apathy disturbing. His good looks only compounded it\u2014he was so handsome that every expression was stark.\nHe looks more like Emperor Arnold Hein now, but still not the same.\nArnold appeared to notice her watching him. When he looked at her, his sourness disappeared, replaced by a genuine smile. All around him, women found themselves flushing. Arnold paid no heed to their fervent gazes, instead leaning in to give Rishe a brief moment of consideration.\nThen he leaned in close enough to kiss her.\n\u201cA dull trip,\u201d he said again, pulling away. \u201cBut fortuitous. Without it, I would have never met the woman destined to be my wife.\u201d\nA shocked murmur rolled through the crowd. Rishe, who hadn\u2019t recovered from seeing Arnold\u2019s beautiful face at close range, barely noticed the looks of utter loathing the assembled women were throwing her.\n\u201cH-His Highness is smiling? At his hostage bride?\u201d\n\u201cHe called her his wife?! He\u2019s never even looked at us!\u201d\nThey were whispers, but they carried.\nA portly man stepped forward with his daughter in tow. \u201cYour Highness, do you mean to say that this lovely young woman is your fianc\u00e9e?\u201d\nEvery eye in the ballroom was on Rishe, alight with curiosity, envy, or schemes. None of them could hide their contempt. But Rishe didn\u2019t falter.\nThis is nothing compared to being publicly dumped in a banquet hall. And I\u2019ve done that seven times!\nShe offered a polite smile and an astoundingly correct curtsy. Left leg at a diagonal behind the right, back straight, head bowed. \u201cHow do you do? My name is Rishe Irmgard Weitzner.\u201d\nEven the most hostile guests could find nothing impolite in her greeting, no sign of rough manners from the rustic daughter of a backwater nation. Rishe had years of training in expectation of ascending to the throne. Occasionally, habits from her other lives slipped through, but Arnold appeared to be the only one who noticed.\nNow he was looking at her with satisfaction. \u201cLady Rishe has only just arrived, and her acquaintances are few and far between. I hope I can count on you all to hold me accountable should I prove an incompetent husband.\u201d\n\u201cB-but of course, Your Highness.\u201d\n\u201cCome, Rishe.\u201d Arnold guided her out of the ring of spectators. The stares continued to follow them as they walked away.\nRishe dropped her voice to a whisper. \u201cYou sure know how to invite the ire of women.\u201d\n\u201cWhatever do you mean?\u201d\n\u201cThe way you harped on about me. Everything you said was tailor-made to stoke their jealousy. You\u2019ve gained me enemies, so",
    "query_text": " thanks for that.\u201d\nArnold snorted. \u201cEverything I said was to protect you from enemies. They need to know you aren\u2019t just some trophy they can eliminate without recourse. We need to show them this to forestall any potential moves against you in the future.\n\u201cShow them what, exactly?\u201d\n\u201cThat I\u2019ll protect you no matter what.\u201d\nHe said it with such nonchalance that it brought her up short. Protect me? Arnold Hein, protect me?\nSuch an ironic position to take. She couldn\u2019t tell him that, of course. Her response came out somewhat strangled. \u201cI doubt they\u2019ll be anything to worry about. In fact, the biggest threat facing me is you.\u201d\n\u201cOh? And why do you say that?\u201d\n\u201cFor many reasons, the most obvious being that I\u2019m no match for"

    "prefix_text": " indeed have been his only weakness.\nIf I strike the same way\u2014huh? Before she could try, Arnold appeared to lose patience, wrapping his arm around her waist. He bent her back into a dip so deep it felt like he\u2019d pulled a carpet from under her feet. She yelped, grabbing at him reflexively, clinging tight. His big hands gripped her securely enough to mitigate the sensation of falling. Relief flooded through her, and she felt a laugh rumble against her ear.\nThe music came to an end with one last ringing note. She blinked. The dance is over?\nA hush fell over the ballroom. Then cheers broke out, followed by a round of applause.\n\u201cThat was incredible!\u201d\nThe watching nobles crowded in.\n\u201cYou two moved in such perfect harmony!\u201d\n\u201cI was on the edge of my seat. I felt like I was watching a sword duel!\u201d\n\u201cIs this a dance from Hermity? I\u2019ve never seen such steps before.\u201d\n\u201cUh, well\u2026\u201d Rishe floundered. She glanced up at Arnold, who appeared to be enjoying her struggle. She\u2019d get no help from him.\nRishe dealt with the barrage of questions as best she could, letting the crowd sweep them into the dining room, which was set up for a buffet-style meal. She made sure to greet every guest, riveting their faces into her memory.\nShe must have been acting peculiar, because Arnold eventually said, \u201cRishe, I think the wine is getting to you. Shall we get some fresh air?\u201d\nRishe hadn\u2019t touched a single drop. In fact, she\u2019d been caught up in so many conversations that she hadn\u2019t even had the chance to eat, but she had experience working on an empty stomach. She accepted Arnold\u2019s encouragement as the escape it was.\nJust when I least expect it, he\u2019ll act the gentleman. Maybe he\u2019d remembered her demand for a carefree life of doing nothing.\nRishe cast a charming look across the crowd. \u201cThank you for your consideration, Your Highness. Forgive me.\u201d She gave a polite bow before quietly slipping away. \nShe didn\u2019t head straight to the balcony but rather slowly walked around the hall. There was only so much she could find out glued to Arnold\u2019s side all night.\nI need information. Galkhein\u2019s political landscape was a mystery to me through all my past lives. I only know the rumors that made it abroad.\nAlthough she knew of Arnold\u2019s eventual patricide, she had no concept of the circumstances leading up to it. She needed a better picture of the factions and power balance inside the court. The lives these people led.\nI know better than to believe wartime gossip. This Arnold Hein is a lot different from what I\u2019d heard he was like at nineteen. He\u2019s not as diabolical as the rumors led me to believe. He likes to push, but he isn\u2019t unkind. The thought drifted across her mind, leaving her conflicted. Well, he\u2019s not unkind now. But I still don\u2019t like not knowing his motives. And he\u2019s a bit of a jerk, to be honest. \nShe tried to settle her mind and just observe. Gathering intelligence was necessary to lead a long, carefree life lazing around the palace.\nIf I recall correctly, that\u2019s Lord Hannawald. He seems to be on good terms with Count Gayle. Duke Hudemann and Duke Teinitz are having a friendly enough conversation, yet they don\u2019t seem close. Rishe ticked off the names of people she\u2019d met, committing them to memory.\nA wave of sweet perfume wafted over her. A pretty girl with soft blonde hair had appeared at her side. \u201cHow do you do, Lady Rishe? I\u2019m Cornelia Thea Toona.\u201d\nDuke Toona\u2019s family was the thirty-first house she\u2019d met tonight.\nRishe smiled graciously. \u201cRishe Irmgard Weitzner. A pleasure to meet you.\u201d\n\u201cThe pleasure is all mine.\u201d Cornelia smiled sweetly. Her eyes were big and bright, her lips full. She held a glass in each hand and offered one to Rishe. \u201cWine? I see you\u2019re empty-handed.\u201d\nA gaggle of other ladies nearby began giggling among themselves.\n\u201cHow dare she act so haughty when she\u2019s a captive. It\u2019s time for her learn just what she is. A pawn to be played and discarded.\u201d\n\u201cShe should enjoy her time on Prince Arnold\u2019s arm while she can.\u201d\n\u201cShe is from a minor nation, after all.\u201d\nAs Rishe took note of their whispers, Cornelia gazed at her with doe eyes. \u201cDoes my offering offend you in some way?\u201d\nIf I remember correctly, House Toona holds a vast territory in southern Galkhein.\nRishe held out a hand to accept the glass. \u201cHow could it? Thank you, Lady Cornelia.\u201d\nBefore Rishe could touch the glass, Cornelia gave a dramatic shout. \u201cOh dear! My hand slipped!\u201d She dropped it, quite obviously on purpose. Without thinking, Rishe grabbed her skirts and leaned back, plucking the glass out of the air with the other hand.\nCornelia let out a cry of surprise as Rishe caught the wine before any could spill. She swirled the glass and brought it to her nose to breathe in the bouquet.\nHmm\u2026 That\u2019s mashed capsicum. Where did she even get that? What a waste of perfectly good wine. And why bother spicing it enough to singe the tongue if she just planned to ruin my dress? Pick a plan, my dear.\nHiding her exasperation, Rishe smiled brightly. \u201cI\u2019ve never had a wine quite like this. What an unusual scent.\u201d\nCornelia bit her lip in frustration. Rishe beamed at her. You\u2019ve got such a pretty face, Lady Toona. Why don\u2019t you smile?\nRishe leaned in close to Cornelia. \u201cThis vintage isn\u2019t available where I\u2019m from. I\u2019m ever so anxious to learn more. Should I perhaps invite Prince Arnold over to enjoy a glass? Which tray did you get this from?\u201d\n\u201cWhat? Oh, um\u2026\u201d Rishe had a policy of never backing down from a fight, but it seemed Cornelia didn\u2019t share it. \u201cS-sorry, but I don\u2019t remember. Such a large hall, you see.\u201d\n\u201cA shame. I\u2019ll just give His Highness this one, then. I\u2019ll be sure to let him know who it\u2019s from.\u201d\n\u201cUh, wait!\u201d Cornelia rapidly shook her head. \u201cI-I got that glass for you, so I think you should\u2014you know what? Never mind! Maybe I should just take that\u2014oh no!\u201d\nRishe ignored the ashen-faced Cornelia, raising the glass and swallowing down a gulp. \n\u201cI-I can\u2019t believe\u2026\u201d\n\u201cSuch a spicy flavor, just as I imagined.\u201d Rishe smiled again to the assembled group\u2019s astonishment. \u201cWhat a warm welcome. I do hope the two of us can spend more time together. Perhaps\u2026a tea party?\u201d\n\u201cTh-the two of us?\u201d Cornelia stammered.\n\u201cYes. I want to know all about House Toona.\u201d\nCornelia looked flabbergasted, but she recovered herself and nodded.\nThat should do. One of Rishe\u2019s eventual plans required a plot of land in a temperate climate. House Toona\u2019s would likely be perfect, but she needed to confirm a few things with Cornelia. Never back down from a fight. Even further\u2026\nShe recalled the words of her mentor from her days as a merchant.\nDon\u2019t bother with fights you can\u2019t win.\nThe other ladies fled, fearful of this strange girl who gulped down painfully spicy wine like it was nothing. \n \n***\n \nRishe retreated to the empty balcony to enjoy the music, grimacing with every stinging mouthful of wine. She drank it in decreasing sips until Arnold joined her.\n\u201cWhat are you making that face for?\u201d\nRishe swirled the glass. \u201cDon\u2019t worry, it\u2019s not you. It\u2019s just this wine is so spicy.\u201d\n\u201cSpicy? The wine is?\u201d\n\u201cMm. It\u2019s seasoned with capsicum. I barely managed to get that first mouthful down without gagging.\u201d\nArnold swiped the glass from her hand. \u201cDon\u2019t tell me this was a poisoning attempt!\u201d\nRishe clicked her tongue in annoyance at her own lack of vigilance. No one else would be able to grab something from her so easily.\nArnold glared at the wine. \u201cYou don\u2019t need to drink this. I\u2019ll get rid of it.\u201d\n\u201cHey, give that back! They ruined a perfectly good glass of wine because of me. I\u2019m not going to waste it.\u201d She grabbed it back and took another sip, shuddering at the taste.\nArnold glowered. \u201cTell me who did this. I\u2019ll have them executed.\u201d\n\u201cDon\u2019t be ridiculous. You don\u2019t kill people like her\u2014you use them.\u201d Just the tiniest bit of wine to go, but it was getting harder to make herself drink it. She gave the glass a reproachful look, then glanced back at Arnold. \u201cOh, and I owe you an apology.\u201d\n\u201cDo you?\u201d\n\u201cI used your name to defend myself.\u201d The girls had only backed off when she threatened to tattle to Arnold. Rishe found that sort of thing inelegant in the extreme, and she was embarrassed.\nArnold sighed at Rishe\u2019s apologetic bow. \u201cThere\u2019s nothing wrong with a wife invoking her husband\u2019s name.\u201d\nRishe hesitated. \u201cWe\u2019re not married yet.\u201d\n\u201cThat\u2019s a formality. It\u2019s as good as done, if you ask me.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2026see.\u201d\nHe took her distraction as an opportunity to swipe her glass back. Instead of dumping it out, Arnold gulped the rest of it down. \n\u201cDamn, that packs a punch,\u201d he grumbled.\n\u201cI told you that!\u201d Rishe snapped. \u201cAre you all right? Let me get you some water!\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m fine. But now you\u2019ve fulfilled your obligation to the wine, haven\u2019t you?\u201d\nRishe didn\u2019t know what to say. He\u2019d helped her\u2014not by taking charge but by following her lead. Without cutting her down and telling her she was being foolish. Without rolling his eyes and dismissing her desires as trifles.\n\u201cThank you,\u201d Rishe said stiffly, which just made him laugh.\n\u201cWhat were you thinking about when we were dancing?\u201d he asked.\n\u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d\n\u201cYou were thinking about someone else, weren\u2019t you? Who?\u201d\nRishe didn\u2019t know a delicate way to say I was thinking about a future version of you I met in another life.\n\u201cHmm?\u201d His tone was oddly light, teasing even. But the gleam in his hunter\u2019s eyes said she wouldn\u2019t get away so easily.\nObviously, Rishe couldn\u2019t give him an honest answer. \u201cI wasn\u2019t thinking about anyone else. I was worried about you.\u201d\n\u201cWhy?\u201d\nThis was the closest she could come to the truth. \u201cWere you injured here?\u201d She patted her own left shoulder with her forefinger. \nArnold went silent. His left shoulder was slightly slower to react than his right\u2014if his right was at one hundred, then his left was at maybe ninety-eight. It was hardly noticeable, but Rishe had picked up on it. He was right-handed, and she wouldn\u2019t have noticed it if they\u2019d been dancing normally. \nThat, and if it hadn\u2019t been for memories from her past life.\nRishe had only managed to inflict a single injury on him. An instant, a moment\u2019s hesitation where she saw her chance and slashed left. Of course, he\u2019d shrugged off the injury and effortlessly run her through. \n\u201cHeh.\u201d Arnold finally broke his silence with grim laughter. His eyes sent shivers down her spine, cold and bewitching. In lieu of an answer, he reached for his collar, unfastening the clasp with a snap and drawing his jacket open with a rough tug.\nOh my.\nRishe drew in a breath. A great scar was engraved into the nape of his neck, just low enough to be concealed by clothing. It looked several years old. \u201cIt\u2019s an old wound. It continues to the top of my shoulder and pulls the skin taut.\u201d\n\u201cHow awful.\u201d Rishe couldn\u2019t help but reach out to gingerly touch the nape of his neck.\nArnold accepted her touch without a word. She\u2019d half expected to be slapped aside.\nHer fingers slowly traced the shape of it. She could feel the rough skin through her gloves.\nHe must have gotten this over a decade ago. Someone stabbed him\u2014and not just once or twice. They must have done it over and over to make this scar pattern.\n",
    "query_text": "Her medical training had her shuddering at the image of a nine-year-old Arnold ashen and trembling with blood loss. The fact that he\u2019d survived and retained the use of his arm was incredible. And then to go on to wield a sword so skillfully\u2014his suffering must have been immense.\n\u201cOnly a few people know about this injury. You\u2019re the first to notice on your own.\u201d\n\u201cHow did it happen?\u201d\nThat grim smile returned as he looked down at Rishe. With the moon hanging behind him, he was as opaque as ever, but Rishe understood the sentiment.\nI shouldn\u2019t pry.\nRishe pulled her hand away, and that ominous smile that sent chills down her spine disappeared."

However, it has granted me insight into how each one of you works.\u201d\nOliver\u2019s face creased in confusion. The newcomer maids began to panic, whispering among themselves.\n\u201cDoesn\u2019t this mean that she helped us out with the laundry?\u201d\n\u201cWe\u2019re going to be fired!\u201d\n\u201cIf I lose my position, my brother will have to quit school!\u201d\nNoticing the commotion, Oliver glanced at Rishe. \u201cYour Highness, two-thirds of these maids are newly recruited from the city. Since the majority of the castle maids were elderly, His Highness assumed you would prefer maids closer in age to yourself.\u201d\nRishe was startled. She had found it odd that most of her potential servants were new hires, but she hadn\u2019t expected this to be the reason.\n\u201cWhile the prince has entrusted the selection of your maids to you,\u201d Oliver went on. \u201cHiring someone with no experience will not do. Despite Prince Arnold\u2019s views, I urge you to reject the newcomers.\u201d\n\u201cOliver.\u201d\n\u201cI have a list of their names here. Elsie\u2014\u201d\n\u201cElsie, Nichole, Hilde, Marguerite, Rosa.\u201d Rishe began listing the names of the newly recruited maids. She\u2019d made a point to memorize them in the washhouse. \u201cElke, Amelia, and\u2014\u201d\nOliver looked at her wildly. \u201cYou know them all?! Even though they\u2019ve never served you in the past?\u201d\n\u201cYes, of course I do. Servants are essential to the maintenance of our lifestyle, why wouldn\u2019t I get to know them?\u201d Rishe listed the remaining names for good measure. \u201cAll twenty of you, listen to me.\u201d \nThe new maids stiffened. Diana and the other maids whose names hadn\u2019t been called were getting their wind back, wearing increasingly triumphant looks.\nRishe said, \u201cThe twenty names I just called will be my maids.\u201d\nTime seemed to stand still a moment, and then Oliver broke in with an astonished, \u201cB-but, my lady! They are all inexperienced\u2014\u201d\n\u201cYes. And my palace will be the perfect place to learn.\u201d\nThe new recruits were completely speechless, unsure of exactly what was happening. \nRishe smiled at Elsie. \u201cI hope you\u2019ll serve me well, Elsie.\u201d\nElsie was still frozen in place. \u201cHuh? Y-yes, my lady, but\u2014\u201d\nA shaking Diana cried out, \u201cBut why, my lady?! You\u2019ve seen their work! They\u2019re useless, the lot of them! The rest of us get so much more done in a shorter amount of time!\u201d\n\u201cWatch your tongue, girl,\u201d Oliver said sharply.\nDiana ignored him. \u201cWe\u2019re hard workers! Any job you assign us, we can do it! Please, I beg you, my lady!\u201d\n\u201cStep back,\u201d Oliver warned. \u201cDo not take a single step closer to Lady Rishe.\u201d\nDiana spoke in a rush, words pouring out of her. \u201cI-I freely admit that I was impolite before, but I didn\u2019t know who she was! I\u2019ll take any punishment, so please, give me the chance to show you how well I can work!\u201d\nRishe said, \u201cDiana, I have a request.\u201d\n\u201cTh-thank you, my lady!\u201d Diana heaved a sigh of relief. \u201cYou mean you\u2019ll\u2014\u201d \nRishe cut across her. \u201cAs of today, you are no longer a maid in this palace.\u201d \n\u201cWhat?\u201d Her face, usually so fixed with determination, paled. \u201cBut why? I\u2019m so much better than any of them! I\u2019ll do a perfect job no matter what task you set before me. Please don\u2019t dismiss me, my lady!\u201d \n\u201cListen to me, Diana.\u201d Rishe dropped her lofty tone, speaking as one woman would to another. \u201cYou have noticed it, haven\u2019t you? No matter what you claim, these new girls aren\u2019t worthless.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2026I don\u2019t understand.\u201d\n\u201cCan you remember your first month in service? How difficult it was?\u201d\nDiana looked completely bewildered. Her gaze darted around as if looking for help.\nPulling herself together, she forced herself to follow Rishe\u2019s directions. She thought back and finally alighted on a response. \u201cI\u2026I didn\u2019t know how to do the job. Before, when my family was still prominent, I\u2019d washed shirts and bedsheets. Never gowns or military uniforms.\u201d\n\u201cPerfectly reasonable,\u201d Rishe said. \u201cOnly natural for someone just starting out.\u201d\n\u201cThe older girls were so busy, they told me to just watch them since they didn\u2019t have time to teach me. When I had questions\u2026well, there was nobody to ask.\u201d\n\u201cI bet. And did you have any other problems?\u201d\n\u201cWell, yes. There was a lot to learn. Different kinds of soap and washboards depending on the cloth. You use different tools for different materials. I had to learn how they worked and how to put them away. I was\u2026punished if I didn\u2019t get it right the first time.\u201d\nThe newcomers were exchanging surprised looks. Rishe understood why.\nEverything Diana said was familiar to them. They spent valuable time searching for their materials and the proper ways to use them, but they shrank from asking for help. Everyone always looked so busy. This was a universal problem.\n\u201cDespite all that, I got better!\u201d Diana protested. \u201cI only needed to be taught once. Unlike them! They\u2019re useless!\u201d\n\u201cYes, well. There\u2019s a difference between you and them,\u201d Rishe told Diana. \u201cYou can read and write.\u201d\n\u201cOh!\u201d Diana started in surprise. Elsie looked at the floor.\nThe literacy rate among commoners was low no matter where you went. Very few families had the means to afford an education, especially for daughters. Diana had been born to a merchant\u2019s family\u2014she\u2019d received formal schooling. The maids she was close friends with were likely from similar backgrounds. The majority of those in service were not so fortunate.\n\u201cWhat if you only received instructions on how to do a job once and weren\u2019t able to write it down to remind yourself later?\u201d Rishe asked. \u201cWould you be so confident?\u201d\n\u201cI-I don\u2019t\u2014\u201d Diana reflexively thrust a hand into her apron pocket, where she had a list of daily tasks recorded in her neat handwriting to reference throughout the day. Hopefully now she would understand how much of an edge her privileged literacy gave her over the other maids.\n\u201cEveryone else works as hard as they can, just like you do,\u201d Rishe said. \u201cRemember how it was for you at first? They all have to start somewhere. I hope you\u2019ll keep that in mind.\u201d\n\u201cThey\u2019re no different from me,\u201d Diana mumbled begrudgingly, glancing around the room, looking at the less experienced maids. As if coming to a decision, she said, \u201cI\u2019m sorry.\u201d\n\u201cDiana?\u201d\nLike a child enumerating her regrets, Diana went on, \u201cI\u2019ve done you wrong, all of you. It\u2019s just, I had nothing. Or so it felt like. No money, no title. I thought I had to make my way in the world on my own. That I had to start from zero.\u201d Her shoulders trembled as she buried her face in her hands. \u201cBut I was wrong! I wasn\u2019t starting from zero. I had everything that I learned growing up. I didn\u2019t realize how fortunate I was. I let it all go to my he\n \n\u201cRISHE IRMGARD WEITZNER! You are a vile woman! A truly malicious creature unworthy of the crown prince! As of this instant, our engagement is off!\u201d \n\u201cAs you wish, Your Highness.\u201d\n\u201c\u2026Huh?\u201d\nThe prince\u2019s declaration echoed throughout the ballroom. Rishe, the duke\u2019s daughter, bowed in response, her coral-toned hair swaying gracefully. The assembled guests found themselves captivated by her dignified beauty. Despite having just witnessed a broken engagement, they couldn\u2019t bring themselves to pity her.\nSlowly, Rishe lifted her head and fixed the prince with a pale-emerald gaze. It caught him off guard, but he quickly recovered.\n\u201cDidn\u2019t you hear what I just said?! I\u2019m calling off our engagement! Doesn\u2019t that trouble you?\u201d\n\u201cNot really.\u201d\nRishe already knew what happened next: false accusations, exile, and her family severing all ties and leaving her to survive on her own. She turned from the prince. There was no point wasting any time.\nThis is my seventh loop, after all.\nRishe had done this all before.\nThe next few hours will be busy. I must hurry and retrieve my things before I\u2019m barred from the family estate. I don\u2019t want this to be one of the times I\u2019m too slow and I have to start my new life with nothing.\n\u201cRishe, halt and hear me! I have spent the past week perfecting my recitation of your crimes!\u201d\nI should take more than dresses this time\u2014there\u2019s plenty of things I could use out in the world. What trade should I take up? In my first life, I was a merchant. In my second, an apothecary. I\u2019ve got a few more I want to try out\u2026 Augh! If time\u2019s just going to keep resetting, I wish I could start at an earlier point. I need more time to prepare!\n\u201cWait! Rishe!\u201d\nThe crown prince was on the verge of tears, and the spectators struggled to suppress their snickers. \nA thought occurred to Rishe, and she stopped. She then turned, her eyes gleaming beneath long lashes as she stared down her ex-fianc\u00e9. \u201cAh, Your Highness, I almost forgot.\u201d \n\u201cYes, tell me!\u201d the prince fumed. \u201cLet me guess, you are hurt beyond measure and yet love me still\u2026correct?\u201d\nAs if. Rishe was grateful to be granted her freedom. In fact, she was smiling as she said, \u201cI hope you and Lady Mary are happy together.\u201d\n\u201cWhat?!\u201d\n\u201cMay we both lead fulfilling lives. Farewell!\u201d Rishe lifted the skirts of her evening gown and turned on her heel, departing as briskly as she could.\n\u201cHow do you know about Mary? I haven\u2019t told you I love her!\u201d The prince was shouting something behind her, but she paid him no mind. She had things to do.\nDuring her first loop, the prince\u2019s accusations had shocked her to the core and she\u2014foolishly so\u2014had attempted to defend herself. Now she knew better than to expect the prince to behave reasonably. \nHow will life unfold this time? I\u2019m excited to find out! Rishe fixed her mind on the future.\nThis is my seventh \u201cdo-over.\u201d I\u2019ve led happy and carefree lives before, but this time\u2014this time, I swear I\u2019ll live a long happy and carefree life!\nIn other words, she needed to avoid getting killed. At any cost. \n \n***\n \nIn the first loop, with her engagement broken and her reputation in tatters, Rishe roamed with nothing but the clothes on jewelry",

I\u2019m aware you don\u2019t desire a wife, but beginning the search would be wise\u2026 Er, Your Highness?\u201d The attendant\u2019s eyes flew wide. His bored and scowling master was laughing. \u201cDid something happen?\u201d\n\u201cOliver, ready my coach. Wait, no. That will take too much time. Bring me a horse.\u201d\n\u201cAt once, Your Highness. Might I ask why?\u201d\nArnold didn\u2019t respond\u2014he just grinned like a hungry wolf catching scent of his prey.\n \n***\n \nOnce outside the palace gates, Rishe threw herself into the waiting coach, shouting for the driver to make haste. She stopped it a few hundred yards from the manor and bid him farewell. \u201cI\u2019m leaving! Thanks for always being such a safe driver, Daniel!\u201d\nThe road to the manor was muddy from a morning rain shower. She knew from her second life that the coach would get stuck, resulting in a loss of valuable time. It was better to just get out and run. \n\u201cHuff, huff.\u201d Despite her last life\u2019s physical conditioning, this body had no stamina. She\u2019d need to try to get fitter faster this time around.\nRishe reached the end of the road, and her heart promptly sank all the way to her feet. \u201cOh no.\u201d\nThe front door was thronged with people, all of them surrounding a carriage bearing the royal family\u2019s coat of arms.\nI need to get out of here.\nWhile she stood frozen in indecision, one of the knights doing crowd control shouted, \u201cYour Highness! I have eyes on Lady Rishe!\u201d\n\u201cGet out of my way!\u201d A familiar voice started up a bellow. \u201cLet me through! Rishe, how dare you make me wait so long?\u201d\nRishe\u2019s ex-fianc\u00e9, Crown Prince Dietrich, stepped triumphantly forward.\n\u201cI know the thought of hearing your crimes enumerated by the man you love must pain you, but alas, as future king, it is my duty to bring down the hammer of justice upon a villainess such as yourself!\u201d\n\u201cI see I\u2019ve timed it badly,\u201d Rishe muttered. \u201cIn fact, this is my worst loop yet. I\u2019d rather be barred from the house than see you again.\u201d\n\u201cHmm? What are you grumbling about?\u201d Dietrich looked Rishe up and down. \u201cI knew it. You put on a brave face, but I can sense the sorrow in your heart.\u201d\n\u201cI beg your pardon?\u201d\n\u201cYour heart!\u201d the prince repeated. \u201cYour heart! It must be absolutely crushed! Because I called off our engagement!\u201d\nRishe wasn\u2019t sure where he was drawing these conclusions from. Possibly the same place he mined for all his bottomless self-confidence.\n\u201cI can tell you\u2019ve been wandering aimlessly, distraught,\u201d the prince went on. \u201cLook at you. Your dress is caked in mud, your shoes are broken, and there are cuts marring your face and arms. What other possible cause could there be than heartbreak?\u201d\nRishe narrowed her eyes. \u201cDo you ever stop to think about the words coming out of your mouth?\u201d\n\u201cWhat?\u201d\nHis interpretation of events was fanciful to the point of absurdity. \u201cI did not dirty my dress or snap my shoes out of heartbreak. Because I feel none. You\u2019ve always been a little slow, so I\u2019ll make this clear: I do not have a single shred of fondness for you, or for our broken engagement.\u201d\n\u201cWhat?!\u201d the prince said. \u201cWhat are you saying?!\u201d\nThe surrounding crowd began to snicker.\n\u201cIsn\u2019t that the crown prince? Did Lady Rishe just dump him?\u201d\n\u201cWait, but wasn\u2019t he trying to dump her?\u201d\n\u201cCan\u2019t be! Look at her! She doesn\u2019t care at all!\u201d\n\u201cHow dare you nobodies make sport of me?\u201d Dietrich screeched. \u201cI am your prince!\u201d\nTemper aside, Dietrich was a handsome man. He had azure-blue eyes and blond hair\u2014a prince straight out of a picture book. His looks and place in the succession meant a never-ending swarm of women vying for his affections. He was brought up a pampered princeling, never wanting for anything. It manifested in a pompous manner and an overconfidence in his own abilities. Rishe had cautioned him about his attitude before, but he never paid her any mind.\nI\u2019m so glad I don\u2019t have to marry him.\nShe wished she could go back and tell the shocked, scared girl from her first life not to worry about her shattered engagement. Still, she might as well say it all here and now, with the assembled knights and citizens to bear witness.\n\u201cYour Highness, you exist to love and protect your people. It\u2019s unbecoming to speak of them in this manner.\u201d\n\u201cYou\u2019re the unbecoming one!\u201d the prince snapped. \u201cBeg me for forgiveness!\u201d\n\u201cI won\u2019t. Calling off our betrothal is the best course, and I applaud Your Highness for your good sense.\u201d\nNow even the knights were trembling with suppressed mirth. \nDietrich was turning red. \u201cD-don\u2019t laugh at me!\u201d\n\u201cLady Rishe,\u201d came a sweet voice. \u201cAren\u2019t you ashamed of yourself?\u201d \nRishe fought down a groan.\nOut of the crowd stepped a charming, dainty girl. Her big eyes moist with tears, she took her place at Dietrich\u2019s side. \u201cI do not allow the people I care about to be treated so very ill!\u201d \n\u201cWhy, Lady Mary. You\u2019re here.\u201d Rishe sighed. \u201cHow nice.\u201d\nThe young Mary scowled through her tears. Hidden behind her skirts, Dietrich continued to shout his disapproval. \u201cRishe! You\u2019ve brought my beloved Mary to tears! She\u2019s told me everything. How you bullied her, ridiculed her. How you find it amusing to lock her in the classroom overnight! Such a wicked woman could never be queen!\u201d\nNone of that\u2019s true.\nRishe glanced at Mary, who averted her gaze a little awkwardly.\n\u201cMore importantly,\u201d Rishe said, \u201chave you already brought your concerns to my parents, Your Highness?\u201d\n\u201cMore importantly?! I did, if you must know! Your parents are furious. They have vowed to disown you.\u201d\n\u201cAh. Then I\u2019m too late.\u201d Her parents held their reputation above all else. Rishe had little hope of retrieving any of her money or belongings now.\n\u201cWhy are you acting so strangely?\u201d Dietrich sniffed. \u201cAh, I understand. You\u2019re in such shock from this turn of events that\u2014\u201d\n\u201cListen, Dietrich.\u201d In her exasperation, Rishe dropped his title. \u201cI accept your decree. We are no longer engaged. I shall never darken your doorstep again. So\u2026relax a little.\u201d\n\u201cHuh? What are you saying?\u201d\n\u201cSince I was a child, I believed that my only value was in our betrothal. Being engaged to the crown prince was my whole reason for living. I was wrong about that. Only I determine my value\u2014no one else. That\u2019s why I don\u2019t care about this. I\u2019m beyond it.\u201d Rishe made sure to look him directly in the eye as she spoke. \u201cYou are an unnecessary element in my life.\u201d\nDietrich staggered back. His legs seemed to go out from under him, and he crumpled. At that, the knights finally let go of their composure, laughing along with the courtiers.\n\u201cSt-stop!\u201d the prince wailed. \u201cYou are my subjects. This\u2026this shows such flagrant disrespect!\u201d\n\u201cDietrich, don\u2019t pay them any mind,\u201d Lady Mary said. \u201cLady Rishe, is this cruelty necessary?\u201d\n\u201cPerhaps this is a blessing in disguise.\u201d Rishe\u2019s attention moved to Mary, making the girl\u2019s slender shoulders jump. She had no reason to worry; Rishe didn\u2019t bite. \u201cI\u2019ve been wanting the opportunity to speak to you, Lady Mary. You\u2019re strong. I admire you very much.\u201d\n\u201cWhat are you talking about?\u201d\n\u201cYou\u2019re a lovely girl who never fails to smile despite your troubles. You don\u2019t put up walls around your heart, and you do your utmost to put others at ease. Even now, you bravely stand before me to protect the prince.\u201d\nMary\u2019s eyes were wide with confusion. Rishe picked her words carefully, attempting to diminish the girl\u2019s guilty feelings, if only a little. \u201cYou need to marry the prince for your family\u2019s sake, right?\u201d\n\u201cHow do you\u2014?\u201d\nRishe had learned this truth in one of her past lives. Mary was born to a poor family, and she had studied like mad to be accepted into the academy to hunt for a husband. She intended to make sure neither she nor her brothers ever went hungry again.\nShe went on, \u201cRemember this: you are the one in control of your life. Don\u2019t sell it to anyone else. Can you trust a man who so easily discards the woman he\u2019s been engaged to since childhood? Do you truly believe he cares for you?\u201d\nAstonishment bloomed across Mary\u2019s face. She looked over at Dietrich, who hadn\u2019t bothered to stand up. The truth was\u2026within a year, Prince Dietrich would be in prison, his title stripped from him. He would plan a mad coup d\u2019\u00e9tat against the king, attempting to provoke the citizens to war. His plan would be discovered in its early stages, rendering him a laughingstock across the kingdom.\n\u201cYou must shape your future with your own hands\u2014you mustn\u2019t entrust your desires to others.\u201d \n\u201cMy\u2026my desires?\nRishe nodded.\nMary was looking at her like she was speaking a foreign language. \u201cBut I\u2019m their elder sister.\u201d Her voice quivered. \u201cI must endure, no matter what. Otherwise, my brothers will never be happy.\u201d\n\u201cAnd you believe their happiness can only be achieved by sacrificing your own?\u201d\nMary gasped as she gaped at Rishe.\n\u201cYou don\u2019t need to throw away your own future to protect those you love,\u201d Rishe told her. \u201cNo matter what path you choose, never forget that.\u201d\n\u201cMy future?\u201d Mary\u2019s voice went ragged, like she was barely suppressing a wail of pain.\n\u201cI wish you a life where both you and your family can be happy,\u201d said Rishe.\nMary stood frozen in place, eyes gleaming like precious stones. Rishe couldn\u2019t help but admire how pretty she was. She truly did wish her happiness. But right now, she needed to take care of herself. \n\u201cWell.\u201d Rishe suddenly broke into a smile, making Dietrich flinch. \u201cI think it\u2019s time for me to be on my way.\u201d\nShe regretted losing access to her room, but she knew her parents wouldn\u2019t let her in. Turning her back on the crowd, Rishe contemplated her next move.\n\u201cWait, Lady Rishe!\u201d Mary\u2019s voice rang out.\n\u201cThat\u2019s right. You\u2019re not going anywhere, Rishe!\u201d The prince joined her. \u201cYou won\u2019t get away with treating me like trash to relieve your own injured heart.\u201d\n\u201cUgh, enough already!\u201d Rishe\u2019s patience was fraying. \u201cI don\u2019t have anything else to say to you. Goodbye!\u201d\n\u201cKnights, stop her!\u201d\nReluctantly, the knights moved to tail Rishe as she walked briskly back down the path. She sympathized with them, but she wasn\u2019t about to let them keep her here. Rounding a corner, she sensed something uncanny. She stopped, the knights quickly catching up with her.\n\u201cMy apologies, Lady Rishe. If you could please remain for just a\u2014whoa!\u201d\nRishe grabbed the hilt of the knight\u2019s sword. Yanking it from his belt, she spun around and stood at the ready. Metal rang against metal as Rishe parried a blow. She glared at her would-be attacker as he stepped out of the shadows.\nArnold Hein!\n\u201cWell, what do you know.\u201d The man smiling so sweetly while their swords locked was the very man who had ended her life. \u201cYou do have some skill.\u201d\nMetal screeched and slid, before Arnold sheathed his sword. Rishe lowered hers. Neither looked away.\n\u201cWho the hell are you?\u201d demanded one of the knights.\n\u201cStand down, good sirs,\u201d Rishe said. \u201cYour interference will only make this worse.\u201d\nThis mostly served to befuddle the knights further. Rishe absolutely couldn\u2019t allow them to come to blows with the crown prince of a friendly nation. And they couldn\u2019t beat him\u2014not even if they took him all at once. Rishe had blocked his blow, but her arm was completely numb. To think he\u2019d be even more powerful in five years.\nHe regarded her unabashedly. \u201cRishe, was that your name? Where did you learn such swordsmanship?\u201d\n\u201cI",
    "query_text": "\u2019m afraid I cannot say. Besides, you were clearly going easy on me.\u201d\n\u201cHa! You could tell?\u201d\nArnold\u2019s manner was throwing her off. He seemed to be enjoying himself. He\u2019s laughing. This monstrous prince is\u2026actually laughing.\nWhen she had met him in her other life, he was cold and merciless, like a genuine monster. And yet here he stood, mellow and smiling.\nThe Emperor Arnold Hein I knew was twenty-four years old, so he\u2019s, what? Nineteen now? This is so weird. He\u2019s grinning like a boy getting into a scrape.\nThat attack had been good-natured as well, almost playful. It had muscle behind it but certainly not any lethal intent. He\u2019d just wanted to force Rishe to"

I\u2019m simply enamored with you.\u201d\n\u201cEnamored\u2026?\u201d\nThat was the last thing she\u2019d expected him to say. Asking him to elaborate didn\u2019t seem worth the breath\u2014he was obviously lying. As if this ruthless, inhuman creature with ice in his veins could feel even a flicker of affection.\n\u201cWhy refuse me?\u201d Arnold asked. \u201cYour engagement is broken, you\u2019re on the verge of exile, and you have no faction or supporters. At this rate, you\u2019ll be dead within a fortnight. I\u2019d call my offer a stroke of unbelievable fortune.\u201d\n\u201cYou\u2019re not wrong,\u201d Rishe admitted. \u201cOnce upon a time, I would have jumped at your offer.\u201d\nIf it had been made in her first life, for instance. But now Rishe knew better. Her life was only just getting started, and the future held endless possibilities. After the horror of her sixth loop, she yearned for freedom.\nI don\u2019t want to marry him. I won\u2019t be anyone\u2019s captive. Still\u2026\nRishe, more than anyone, knew that the slightest adjustment could enact profound changes on the trajectory of a life. No doubt she\u2019d have many more lives, but this could be the only one where marriage to Arnold would be an option.\nThe dread emperor. The tyrant. The man who will stoke the fires of war. \nRishe knew the gossip, the endless conjecture behind Arnold Hein\u2019s bloody reign, but she didn\u2019t know the truth.\nWhy? The question had haunted her since her first life. She\u2019d never before had the chance to even speak to him.\nShe had wondered it as a merchant, hearing of the distant outbreak of war. She\u2019d wondered when the news of the dead and dying reached her apothecary. When she had comforted her terrified mistress in her life as a maid, assuring her everything would be all right. When she squared off against him in battle, as he plunged a sword through her heart\u2014even then she wondered. \nIf I stick around, maybe I\u2019ll finally have my answer. Half of her was dying to know. The other half didn\u2019t give a damn. And yet\u2026\nShe recalled a childhood dream. Rather, a longing.\nRishe let out a breath. \u201cYou claim you are enamored with me.\u201d\n\u201cYes. I am completely under your spell.\u201d\nTo think he could spout such nonsense with a straight face!\n\u201cThen will you grant me anything I desire?\u201d\n\u201cSo long as it is within my power,\u201d Arnold said. \u201cAnything you want will be yours.\u201d\nRishe hesitated, gathering her thoughts. \u201cI have some conditions.\u201d Arnold silently motioned for her to go on. \u201cI want full control over the wedding festivities. Everything must be procured through merchants of my choosing.\u201d\n\u201cFine.\u201d Arnold nodded. \u201cYou\u2019re free to do business with whomever you wish.\u201d\n\u201cAfter we are married, I must be in a position to mingle with guests from abroad.\u201d\n\u201cThat sounds within the purview of the crown princess. Anything else?\u201d\n\u201cI will be allowed to live in a separate residence from your mother and father.\u201d\nShe meant this seriously, but it made Arnold laugh. \u201cYou don\u2019t seem the type to worry about an overbearing mother-in-law.\u201d\n\u201cYou would be surprised. Combative relationships with one\u2019s new family are the most difficult part of marriage, or so they say. It could be a ramshackle cottage for all I care\u2014I just require a secondary residence.\u201d\nActually, Rishe didn\u2019t care at all about in-laws. When Arnold set his war into motion, his first move would be the assassination of his father. A genuine coup by patricide, not at all like Dietrich\u2019s clumsy attempt. Next, he would name himself emperor, take control of the country, and mobilize the military.\nSeparating him from his parents will make the first step more difficult\u2014although not impossible, unfortunately.\n\u201cAnything else?\u201d Arnold asked. \u201cI\u2019ll do whatever it takes to marry you.\u201d\n\u201cIdeally, I\u2019d like to know your endgame,\u201d Rishe said with dignity. \u201cBut as I doubt there\u2019s any chance of that, I have one final request.\u201d She jabbed a finger into his face, regardless of how rude it was. \u201cI will spend my time idling around the castle. No work, no study. I shall be utterly useless.\u201d\nLet\u2019s see just how much you want me as your princess.\nAfter a long moment of silence, Arnold cracked a merry laugh. The proposal remained; all her conditions were met.\n\n(2) chapter number given is likely out of range: 0\nChapter: 7\n\nChapter 2\nChapter 2\n \n\u201cYOU KNOW, it was only after I went into commerce that I truly had a dream for the future,\u201d Rishe had once confided in a friend. \u201cUp until then, I existed only as the crown prince\u2019s fianc\u00e9e or my father\u2019s daughter. My every act was to become more worthy of that status. But now, for the first time, I actually have a goal of my own.\u201d\n\u201cOh, yeah?\u201d her friend said. He was the ruler of the desert kingdom, and his smile was awfully charming. \u201cWhat\u2019s that?\u201d\nRishe smiled back. \u201cI want to travel to every single country in the world. I want to see everything in every town, peruse their markets, and meet the eyes of every person who lives there!\u201d\nBy now, that felt like such a distant dream.\n \n***\n \nRishe awoke with a start, eyes snapping open as she sensed a disturbance in the air.\nShe unsheathed her sword halfway, primed for danger. \nInside the coach, her old enemy sat across from her, one hand outstretched. \u201cWhat do you think you\u2019re doing?\u201d she demanded.\nWhen they\u2019d boarded the coach, Rishe had warned him not to lay a single finger on her throughout the trip to his kingdom. Ordering the prince not to touch his consort was absurd, but Arnold readily agreed. He had, after all, promised to follow her every direction.\nAnd yet, here he was, already breaking his promise.\nArnold appeared unperturbed by her glare. \u201cDon\u2019t look at me like that. I was merely trying to recover what you took from me.\u201d\nConfused, Rishe looked at the sword in her hand. It had a black lacquered scabbard with a simple golden decoration. Engraved on the hilt was the Galkhein crest.\n\u201cOh!\u201d Rishe thrust the sword back at Arnold. \u201cMy apologies.\u201d\nArnold chuckled. \u201cYou caught me off guard. You were nodding off, and then you suddenly snatched up my sword. You looked quite content snuggling up with it.\u201d\nArnold propped the sword beside him. Rishe pressed a hand to her chest to quell her racing heart. The sword that gutted me in my previous life is now my bedmate. What a world. Her recent stint as a knight had left her ill at ease without a blade at hand. She just couldn\u2019t believe it was Arnold\u2019s she\u2019d reached for.\n\u201cI didn\u2019t mean to disturb you, but I doubted sleeping with a weapon would be comfortable. I\u2019m impressed you sensed my intent before I even touched you.\u201d Arnold rested one elbow against the window frame, watching her with shameless fascination. \u201cOne only develops instincts like that from combat training. And you were also a member of the court? How in the world did you find the time?\u201d\nRishe shrugged. She couldn\u2019t just say, I pretended to be a man in a previous life, that\u2019s how.\n\u201cI assume there\u2019s more to you than your devotion to the sword. You seem to like flowers.\u201d\nShe followed Arnold\u2019s gaze to where she\u2019d bundled a small bouquet in a handkerchief. This was their fifth day on the road to Galkhein. Every day, without fail, she\u2019d picked flowers whenever they stopped to water the horses. The ones from today were still fresh, but the ones she\u2019d begun drying five days ago were just about ready.\n\u201cI didn\u2019t pick these because they\u2019re pretty.\u201d Rishe brought the blooms to her face, spirits rising at their sweet scent. Spring wildflowers had a soft and gentle smell. Rishe looked out the window at the forest spreading toward Galkhein, thinking of the rare native flowers going into bloom. She wished she could pick those as well, but that would cause too much delay. She gazed on wistfully.\nAfter watching her in silence for some time, Arnold said, \u201cBy the way, I sent one of my men ahead on a fast horse to deliver your order to the company you requested. They\u2019ll be invited to Galkhein to discuss the wedding ceremony.\u201d\n\u201cThank you,\u201d Rishe said. \u201cI\u2019m glad you kept your word.\u201d\n\u201cThe Aria Trading Company,\u201d Arnold mused. \u201cI\u2019ve heard of them. They\u2019re up-and-comers, aren\u2019t they? Have you done business with them before?\u201d\n\u201cNo, but I heard from a friend that they hold a very high standard of quality.\u201d\nRishe was pleasantly surprised at how easily Arnold had acceded to her request. Typically, a royal household had their own personal dealer. Getting them to do business with someone else could be difficult.\nI want to establish a connection with Aria as soon as possible, Rishe thought. It was, of course, the company that had taken her in during her first life.\nThe company had been established just two years prior to picking her up by its owner, a man named Tully. They were still in their growth stage, but in just a few years, they would be the grandest trading company in all the world. They\u2019d proven a great boon in her life as an apothecary as well, helping to distribute her newest medicines. She\u2019d struggled to win their trust initially, but she pledged to work much harder this time around.\nThis marriage isn\u2019t going to happen\u2014I need an escape plan for when it all falls apart. I must bring to bear all my knowledge and influence as a crown princess.\nRishe didn\u2019t know Arnold\u2019s plans, but she had no intention of sitting around and waiting for him to use her as he pleased. She\u2019d spend her time as his consort wisely. Everything must serve her ultimate goal: to live longer than five years, and live well.\nHer fierce determination must have shown on her face because Arnold gave her a little bemused smile. \u201cYes?\u201d\nGod! Rishe grimaced at that flawlessly handsome countenance. Such beauty, possessed by such powerful destruction. The fact that he\u2019d been the man to kill her did nothing to lessen her fascination. In fact, it almost made it worse. The study of contrasts.\n\u201cSorry, I just\u2014\u201d\nShe was interrupted by the horses\u2019 loud whinnies.\n\u201cStop! Hey, stop the coach!\u201d\nShouts drifted back from conveyance ahead of theirs, which contained the luggage and attendants. The squadron of knights tailing the column of coaches sped off toward the front.\n\u201cWho do you think you\u2014graaargh!\u201d\nThat didn\u2019t sound good. Rishe moved to climb out, but Arnold was faster. He drew his sword.\n\u201cHey!\u201d\nArnold locked the door from the outside. \u201cStay hidden.\u201d\nWhy is he putting himself in danger? That\u2019s what knights are for! The fact that Rishe had been about to do the same thing didn\u2019t occur to her. It\u2019s probably bandits. He told me to stay hidden in here, but I\u2019m not so sure about that.\nArnold had left her locked in from the outside, hoping to keep her safe, but Rishe didn\u2019t like her odds. There were five coaches, but this one was certainly the grandest. It locked on the inside as well, but that wouldn\u2019t stop someone with enough determination. If she did as she was told, she\u2019d just be waiting patiently for a bandit to break a window and drag her out.\nKeeping one eye on the coachmen fleeing into the forest, Rishe began a methodical search for something to help her. Right\u2014her hairpin!\nThis sure brings me back. She unfastened it, twisting it into the gap in the door. Back when I was a maid, my lady would lock herself in her chambers all the time to avoid her studies. I had to break her out just like this.\nThe lock on the coach was simple, and it came open easily. Once she was free, she scanned her surroundings. She didn\u2019t see anyone who looked immediately hostile, but there was noise up ahead. Cautiously, she headed toward it.\nBefore long, she found Arnold.\nWow.\nRoughly ten men\u2014the bandits, she presumed\u2014lay crumpled on the ground. In their midst stood Arnold, in the process of tripping another man into the dirt. He scowled, blade at the man\u2019s throat. \u201cIs that it, then?\u201d\n\u201cGwugh!\u201d\nArnold kicked the bandit in the stomach, eyes blazing with cruelty. \u201cThat\u2019s all the thrill you offer me after I went to the trouble of drawing my sword? Barely worth it. I\u2019m bored already.\u201d\nHe wasn\u2019t angry; on the contrary, he stared his enemies down with chilly disappointment, as if this had all been a letdown. Even Arnold\u2019s own knights seemed terrified of their master when he was in a mood. Arnold smoothly flicked the blood off his sword, wiping the blade on the bandit\u2019s shirt before sheathing it. The rest of the men on the ground seemed to be unconscious.\nWait, he didn\u2019t kill anyone? Why not? Is it because we haven\u2019t reached Galkhein?\nShe supposed even Arnold knew better than to go around killing the citizens of other countries. Or perhaps he had yet to become the ruthless monster she knew him as.\nArnold seemed to sense her gaze, turning around with a start. Genuine emotion bloomed on his face, worlds away from the blank mask he wore to face down the bandits. \u201cHow did you get out of the coach?\u201d\nRishe shrugged. \u201cIf I tell you, you\u2019ll be able to prevent me from doing it again.\u201d\nArnold snickered. \u201cYou continue to amaze me.\u201d\nHow can you go from ice-cold to suddenly looking like a normal nineteen-year-old? It\u2019s disconcerting. \nRishe fought down her disquiet as a man alighted from a coach and shouted, \u201cYour Highness! Not again!\u201d He was Oliver, one of the prince\u2019s attendants. He had silver hair and was roughly as tall as Arnold.\n\u201cWhat do you think all these knights are for, decoration? Why do you insist on endangering yourself?\u201d\nRishe had only met Oliver briefly a few days ago, but he didn\u2019t appear to be intimidated by Arnold at all. And, well\u2026he\u2019s not wrong.\nShe feared the menace would return to Arnold\u2019s expression, but he just looked annoyed. \u201cI could tell they were prepared to kill. I\u2019d prefer to take the burden on myself than risk multiple injuries so far afield. And we already have casualties.\u201d\nHe was right. Several injured knights leaned listlessly among the trees. Arnold issued orders to those still able-bodied. \u201cFirst squad, see to the wounded. Second squad, arrest these men.\u201d\n\u201cYes, sir!\u201d\nOliver appeared unsatisfied. \u201cYour Highness, that is a weak justification. I\u2019m overjoyed you\u2019re well, but you must consider Lady Rishe. Perhaps next time we run into a team of murderous brigands, you could allow your consort to remain in the coach.\u201d\n\u201cI told her to remain in the coach!\u201d\nRishe quickly averted her gaze, turning her attention to the wounded knights. They didn\u2019t appear badly injured, yet they all seemed exhausted.\n\u201cExcuse me, can I take a look?\u201d Rishe approached the knight acting as a medic. He looked round, startled by her presence.\n\u201cNonsense, my lady. Don\u2019t trouble yourself, you must have had quite a scare.\u201d\nThis was not unreasonable, but the wariness in his eyes made it clear he wanted her nowhere near his comrade. He isn\u2019t just being polite. He truly is on guard. \nBeside them, an injured knight groaned as another helped him up. \u201cWhat\u2019s wrong with you?\u201d the second knight asked the first. \n\u201cI-I feel\u2026numb.\u201d\n\u201cWhat? Damn.\u201d The knight grabbed up one of the fallen bandit\u2019s swords, going pale as he inspected the blade. \u201cYour Highness, look at this. Poison.\u201d\nArnold clicked his tongue. \u201cLocate every laceration and bind them close to the heart. Suck the poison from the wounds.\u201d\nHe mostly got that right, at least. In the meantime, Rishe located the nearest bound bandit and pulled his dagger out of its sheath. Its wet coating gleamed in the sunlight, just as the knight had said.\nThey applied the poison liberally\u2014whatever it is must be cheap and easily bought in bulk.\nShe wafted the smell toward her, bracing for something rancid, but detected nothing. Then she brought it closer to her",
    "query_text": " nose.\nIt smells sweet, like an overripe apple. Shea grass and\u2026bluecap mushrooms. All the knights appear to have the same symptoms, so I won\u2019t have to check every blade.\nRishe stood back up and headed for the coach.\nOliver took a step after her. \u201cYour Highness, Lady Rishe is\u2014\u201d\n\u201cLeave her. She may do as she pleases.\u201d\n\u201cShe\u2019s well trained,\u201d Oliver mused. \u201cBut"

I was just thinking how very unusual you are.\u201d He was smiling again. \u201cI\u2019m looking forward to how you\u2019ll surprise me next.\u201d\nLike I\u2019m some sort of rare pet he bought to entertain him. She didn\u2019t like that. Nothing she\u2019d done was at all remarkable\u2014normal tasks performed by a normal person.\n\u201cI didn\u2019t make that antidote for your amusement.\u201d\n\u201cI realize that.\u201d The instigating smile faded from his lips. \u201cYou know, those knights you coerced into taking your home-brewed medicine were all born in the slums.\u201d\n\u201cCoerced? That\u2019s hardly the word I\u2019d use.\u201d\n\u201cGalkhein claims to value merit above all else, but in the end, people are judged by where they came from. Despite this, those men fought their way up from nothing.\u201d\nRishe paused in plucking the seeds from a flower and looked up at Arnold.\n\u201cThe men with the worst cases of the paralysis were all newly assigned. They\u2019ve spent weeks training to ensure this mission was a success. That older knight\u2014the one who bowed to you\u2014sustained an injury protecting the rookies. He cares deeply about his men.\u201d\n\u201cYou seem to care about them too,\u201d Rishe commented.\n\u201cI handpicked them for my retinue.\u201d Arnold clambered to his feet, only to fall into a bow. \u201cAnd you kept them safe. You have my deepest gratitude.\u201d\nRishe found herself at a loss for words. Was this Arnold putting on a mask to hide the monster within? Or was this the real him? She remembered the way he\u2019d looked when he held his blade to the bandit\u2019s throat, like a child poised to break a toy he had grown bored of.\n\u201cDon\u2019t mention it,\u201d Rishe said, uncomfortable. \u201cI knew how to do it, so I did.\u201d\nArnold laughed softly. \u201cBe that as it may, I\u2019d still count a noblewoman who can brew remedies from wildflowers by the side of the road a rare find.\u201d\n\u201cEarlier, when you grabbed my wrist\u2026\u201d Rishe steered the subject away from her incongruous knowledge. \u201cYou broke your promise. You said you wouldn\u2019t touch me.\u201d\n\u201cThat was reflex,\u201d Arnold protested. \u201cI thought you were going to hurt yourself.\u201d\nSuch a simple conversation, so casual. It had Rishe feeling positively peculiar.\n\u201cWhy are your knights so wary around me?\u201d she asked. \n\u201cWary? Oh, they were all at the palace when you broke your first engagement. They\u2019re most likely concerned I\u2019m bringing home a villainous jilt who will lead to my ruin. Something silly like that.\u201d\n\u201cI see.\u201d Apparently, being dumped by a prince called into question one\u2019s herbalist abilities.\n\u201cI\u2019m glad you mentioned it,\u201d Arnold went on, \u201cbecause there may be people in Galkhein who will oppose our union. I will do everything in my power to protect you, but you must bring any insults or threats to me right away.\u201d\n\u201cAre there likely to be many?\u201d\n\u201cIn theory, the crown prince may choose his own wife, but the done thing is, of course, to marry a princess. I assume a duke\u2019s daughter would have at least some ties to the royal family?\u201d\nHe assumed correctly. She was in the family tree, if a rather distant branch.\n\u201cMy father has ordered me to choose a bride from a different kingdom rather than a woman of my own land because\u2014\u201d\n\u201cOne never knows when a hostage will come in handy,\u201d Rishe finished for him.\nGalkhein was an expansionist empire. Currently, peace reigned\u2014but peace was precarious. If Galkhein demanded any of the countries to hand over a princess bride, then none were in a position to refuse. With his daughter in the hands of a foreign power, no king would dare oppose a war that power cared to wage.\n\u201cI sent a message to my father telling him I happened upon a close relation of Hermity\u2019s king\u2014a duke\u2019s daughter who had been recently tossed aside by her fianc\u00e9e,\u201d Arnold said. \u201cI also may have implied I was the reason for your falling out\u2014yours and the prince\u2019s. Why, when I saw a woman so powerful and connected and beloved, I couldn\u2019t help but plunder you.\u201d\n\u201cPlunder me? That\u2019s certainly one way to describe it.\u201d Dietrich had kicked up an almighty fuss, despite being the one who broke the engagement.\n\u201cMy father approves of you because he sees you as a bargaining chip. There will be others who aren\u2019t prepared to accept you so willingly.\u201d\n\u201cIs that so?\u201d Rishe said steadily.\n\u201cNever fear,\u201d Arnold responded. \u201cThey\u2019ll eat their words, every one of them. They will receive you as their crown princess if they value their\u2014\u201d\n\u201cNo, being a hostage is perfect.\u201d \nArnold stared at her. \u201cHm?\u201d\n\u201cAs a hostage, I\u2019ll have no official duties, will I? We can pretend I\u2019m here only under great duress, and there will be no need for my comment on governmental or diplomatic affairs.\u201d\nArnold hesitated. \u201cI suppose not.\u201d\n\u201cExcellent! Then I can live my dream of being utterly useless.\u201d Rishe trembled with delight. The thought of acting as an ambassador had really been weighing on her mind. Being a princess was nonstop work. Having been groomed for the position from an early age, Rishe knew members of the royal family barely even had time to sleep.\nBut prisoners didn\u2019t have places in government.\n\u201cThis is such a weight off my mind,\u201d Rishe admitted. \u201cThank you so much for keeping your promise, Your Highness.\u201d\n\u201cEr, of course.\u201d\n\u201cBut don\u2019t worry, I won\u2019t shirk my duties as wedding planner.\u201d Nearly ready to collapse with relief, Rishe returned to her herbs.\n \n***\n \nAfter the bandit incident, Rishe felt the knights begin to ease a bit in her presence.\nDespite their initial reluctance to accept her help, they continued to report the injured men\u2019s progress and bring any concerns directly to her. In return, they took over gathering herbs from the surrounding countryside on their rest stops.\nShe hadn\u2019t done it for gratitude, but she was nonetheless touched. Gathering medicinal herbs had been second nature ever since her life as an apothecary, and it was foolish to ever turn down loyalty.\nSeveral days after the altercation with the bandits, the coach train finally arrived in the imperial capital of Galkhein.\n\u201cOh my,\u201d Rishe murmured as they passed through the gates.\nWhite stone buildings stood in straight rows, lining clean, orderly streets. The first stories all appeared to be shops, while the second-floor windows were festooned with flowers. Everywhere she looked were smiling faces, citizens turned out to witness their prince\u2019s return over the smooth brick roads. Overlooking it all was the towering magnificence of the imperial palace.\n\u201cThe capital is the seat of power in Galkhein,\u201d Arnold explained. \u201cSeveral key trade routes converge here.\u201d\nRishe nodded, suddenly anxious to be out of the coach. More and more people were gathering to watch their progress, some carrying shopping bags in both arms or holding hands with children. Many of them waved, as if greeting someone dear to them.\nHappy citizens and clean, orderly streets meant wealth. Galkhein was well-off. Rishe couldn\u2019t help but grin at an adorable little girl watching them roll by with sparkling eyes. When she saw Rishe\u2019s smile, she blushed and leapt up in the air, laughing with delight.\nThe coach made its way through the city before passing through the castle gates. Lines of disciplined knights flanked the road, ready to greet the crown prince and his fianc\u00e9e.\nArnold stepped out of the coach, holding out his hand to Rishe. She took it reflexively as she alighted. A prince would be expected to help any lady out of carriage, never mind his own consort, yet for some reason the knights looked a bit disturbed.\nRishe shot them back of look of innocent confusion.\n\u201cOur long journey is at last at its end, Your Highness, Lady Rishe.\u201d Oliver emerged from the ranks of the knights, bowing. He shot Arnold a curious glance. \u201cHow novel to see you taking the hand of your fianc\u00e9e.\u201d\nAh! Rishe realized that she herself had willingly broken the condition that she had imposed. Arnold had offered his hand, but she was the one who accepted.\nArnold gave a little laugh of triumph. Rishe felt a rush of frustration at being tricked. \nOliver stared at them before leaning in to whisper in Arnold\u2019s ear. Arnold let out a breath of annoyance. \n\u201cIs something the matter?\u201d Rishe asked.\n\u201cI sent orders ahead to have a detached wing of the palace prepared for us, but it seems the preparations are behind schedule. I\u2019m sorry, but you\u2019ll need to stay in a guest room in the main palace for a few days.\u201d\n\u201cOh, I don\u2019t mind if the wing isn\u2019t ready,\u201d Rishe said. \u201cWe can head over there now.\u201d\n\u201cIt hasn\u2019t been used in quite a while. It\u2019ll be covered in dust.\u201d\n\u201cI said that I didn\u2019t mind if it was a mess, remember? But there\u2019s no need for you to put yourself out. By all means, stay in the main palace for as long as you need.\u201d Rishe had spent a life as a maid\u2014dust didn\u2019t scare her. \u201cBesides, I\u2019m a hostage, after all.\u201d\n\u201cYou could at least attempt to sound distressed,\u201d Arnold said with the slightest trace of petulance. \nRishe, who had a huge grin spreading over her face and her chest puffed out with pride, didn\u2019t respond.\n \n***\n",
    "query_text": " \nThe detached wing turned out to be just a separate palace in the distant corner of the grounds\u2014a scant four stories tall and, as advertised, absolutely swimming in dust.\nNot so bad, though. Rishe had pictured decay and clutter, but it was mostly just bare. Bare and musty, but not rotten or falling apart.\n\u201cYou can do whatever you want with this"

We have books from all over the world.\u201d\n\u201cReally? You have a library that big?\u201d Rishe\u2019s eyes sparkled with delight. She pointed out another building. \u201cWhat about that spire? It\u2019s beautiful.\u201d\n\u201cThe church and clock tower. The bells ring out the hour.\u201d\n\u201cOoh, how wonderful! And it looks like there\u2019s a rather big market there too?\u201d\n\u201cYes, the largest market in the city. Carts line up in the early morning. Most of the offerings are made fresh every day.\u201d\n\u201cAmazing! And what about that pretty mountain over there?\u201d\nRishe tried and failed to contain her excitement. She couldn\u2019t help but imagine what seeing all these places up close would be like. The grand library, the beautiful church that told the time, and the morning market with fresh, delicious food\u2014she wanted to experience it all.\nSeeing Arnold\u2019s bemused face, she said, \u201cWhat?\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m just wondering where all this interest is coming from,\u201d he said. \u201cYou were so reluctant to come, yet here you are, brimming with curiosity for my city.\u201d\n\u201cWell\u2026\u201d she trailed off, unsure of how to respond.\nWhat should I say? Should I just tell him the truth?\nThis wasn\u2019t a secret, but talking about her hopes and dreams to the man who had killed her was a little awkward. A strange self-consciousness settled on her, her cheeks heating as she mumbled, \u201cBecause I\u2019ve always wanted to.\u201d\nArnold looked at her keenly. \u201cWanted to what?\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019ve always wanted to come here.\u201d\nDuring her life as a merchant, Rishe developed her single dream to visit everywhere in the world. That dream was cut tragically short when only one country remained: Galkhein.\nIn each of her consecutive lives, Rishe\u2019s priority became staying alive. Every time, without fail, just as she found her footing, the world was plunged into chaos. She never had the chance to see Galkhein. This betrothal was her chance. \u201cIt\u2019s probably why I agreed to marry you,\u201d she added after a moment\u2019s hesitation.\nArnold swept a tepid glance over the city. \u201cThere\u2019s nothing here worth seeing.\u201d\n\u201cThat\u2019s not true! The places you just told me about sound amazing! Your citizens are clean and happy, your knights are proper and kind. Oh, and another\u2014\u201d \nRishe broke off enumerating Galkhein\u2019s charms as Arnold turned to look at her. His face was impassively calm, but something seemed to pass by underneath, like a shadow in deep water.\n\u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d Rishe said. \u201cDid I say something odd?\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m just amazed you could be so unaware of yourself.\u201d \nWh-what a rude thing to\u2014\n\u201cI\u2019ve never met anyone like you. No one has ever spoken to me the way you do. I don\u2019t know any girls of your class with the knowledge or the physical abilities you possess. Noblewomen don\u2019t concern themselves with such things.\u201d\nRishe, there is no need for you to think for yourself.\nShe frowned. \u201cPerhaps you\u2019re right, but everything I\u2019ve learned is precious to me. No one can take my skills away\u2014I value them with my life. Some may say that my knowledge is worthless, but it makes no difference to me.\u201d She turned from the balcony, fixing him with a piercing gaze. \u201cI\u2019m the one who decides what I value.\u201d\nRishe had clawed free of her mother and father\u2019s indoctrination a long time ago. Man, woman\u2014it didn\u2019t matter. She could do anything. Being queen was not the culmination of her life; she wouldn\u2019t trade her freedom for anything.\nArnold matched her intensity. \u201cYou\u2019re right.\u201d He gently cupped her cheek in a one hand, swiping his thumb along the line of her jaw, smearing dust. \u201cLive your life here however you wish. I vow to do my utmost to protect you.\u201d\n\u201cHuh?\u201d\nHis vehemence took her by surprise. Arnold had every right to demand she act the part of a proper consort. This was a political marriage; Rishe was essentially a hostage, after all. Yet here he was, cosigning her misbehavior. Moreover, he was all but swearing to defend her from the consequences.\n\u201cWhy?\u201d\n\u201cYou know why. I\u2019m enamored with you.\u201d Arnold fed her the same line. \u201cI know you said you don\u2019t care about other people\u2019s approval, but I like your asymmetrical talents. I don\u2019t find them useless at all.\u201d \nRishe didn\u2019t know how to respond.\n\u201cI thought I\u2019d already made that clear.\u201d He took his hand back, drawing away, stopping just on the threshold. He turned back to a stunned Rishe and said, \u201cLet me know if there\u2019s anything you desire. I realize I just broke our agreement\u2014the one about not touching you.\u201d\nAnd with that, he was gone.\nShaken, Rishe sank to the floor of the balcony. I can\u2019t predict him at all! Just what is Arnold Hein planning?\nThe quiet of evening fell over the imperial capital of Galkhein.\n \n***\n \n\u201cMmm.\u201d\nSunshine streamed through the window as Rishe roused from sleep. She rolled over, basking in the morning light. The wall she expected wasn\u2019t there, and the bed seemed larger than usual. Taking advantage of it, she stretched out as far as she could.\nWas this her chamber at home? Or maybe she was a merchant again, spending a night at the desert king\u2019s palace. Perhaps this was her bed of straw from her life as a maid? Her memories met and interwove as she drifted into wakefulness.\nWhen Rishe finally opened her eyes, she grew even more confused.\nLight blue curtains surrounded the bed, thin enough to allow sunlight to pass through. She pulled them aside to find herself in a bare room devoid of furniture and carpet.\nOh, right. She didn\u2019t need to report for morning training, tend to her herb garden, prepare breakfast, or see how the bottles she had brewed overnight were coming along.\nRealizing that, Rishe buried her face in the pillow. \u201cSo soft,\u201d she murmured. \nJudging by the position of the sun, it was about six o\u2019clock in the morning. She was pretty sure she had gone to bed around midnight last night.\nI slept for six whole hours? Rishe couldn\u2019t believe it. Generally, she was used to getting about four hours of sleep. On bad days, at the height of an emergency as a knight or apothecary, she wouldn\u2019t even get that much. \nI\u2019ve got nothing but cleaning on the schedule today. Hostages can sleep in, right? At least a little? Excitement suffused her at the thought, but that was interrupted by a knock on the door.\n\u201cLady Rishe, are you awake? It\u2019s Oliver\u2014Prince Arnold\u2019s attendant.\u201d\nRishe sat up with a start. \u201cI\u2019m awake!\u201d\nOliver continued to speak through the door. \u201cI apologize for bothering you at such an early hour. I\u2019m here with a delivery.\u201d\n\u201cJust a moment!\u201d Rishe slipped out of the bed, dressed quickly, and tugged the bed\u2019s canopy closed. She opened the door to find Oliver standing in the hallway with a polite smile.\nHe apologized again. \u201cThis was the only time I could slip away from His Highness\u2019s office. I\u2019m glad to see that you\u2019re already dressed.\u201d\n\u201cNot at all.\u201d Rishe paused, stepping back to allow him inside. \u201cOh my. You look exhausted.\u201d\nOliver grimaced. \u201cIs it that obvious? We\u2019ve been climbing through mountains of paperwork, but never mind me. His Highness has been working around the clock.\u201d\nRishe thought back to yesterday, how he had come all the way out to the balcony. He should have used that spare time to sleep. \u201cHe\u2019s in high demand, isn\u2019t he? He was even working on the trip over.\u201d\n\u201cHe finished all the work he brought along with us,\u201d Oliver confirmed. \u201cNow he\u2019s dealing with everything that piled up during his visit to Hermity.\u201d\n\u201cOh.\u201d Rishe grimaced in sympathy. He may have killed her in a past life, but she wouldn\u2019t wish the bureaucracy of kingship on anyone. \u201cIt\u2019s a shame he had to put his work on hold to attend a silly engagement party.\u201d\n\u201cNo matter. That party was how a committed bachelor finally found a bride.\u201d\nHis smile was sincere, but Rishe knew better. She spread her arms. \u201cGo on. Shall I spin around so you have a better view?\u201d\nOliver blinked. \u201cI beg your pardon?\u201d\n\u201cYou\u2019re looking me over like I\u2019m a horse for sale. If there\u2019s anything I can help you with, please let me know.\u201d\nOliver\u2019s brows went up. He let out a little breath of resignation. \u201cHis Highness was right. You do possess the keen perception of a knight. Of course, I\u2019m purely an amateur myself.\u201d\nI\u2019d say this was a merchant\u2019s sixth sense, rather than battle intuition.\nThis wasn\u2019t the first time Rishe had caught Oliver looking at her. It reminded her of the way her noble customers would examine a product, assessing worth and authenticity. Or a merchant weeding out potential merchandise from a wide array of choices.\nIn other words, he was appraising her.\nOliver moved into a deep, sweeping bow. \u201cMy sincerest apologies, my lady. I have been unaccountably rude to my lord\u2019s consort. My behavior was unacceptable.\u201d\nRishe shook her head. \u201cPlease don\u2019t, it\u2019s fine.\u201d It wasn\u2019t unreasonable for the prince\u2019s closest attendant to be wary of strangers. But it did make her curious. \u201cHow long have you worked for Arnold? Have you always been a valet?\u201d\n\u201cI trained as a squire, actually,\u201d Oliver replied. \u201cBut I was injured and dismissed from the order. His Highness took me into his household soon after. I have served him for nearly a decade.\u201d\n\u201cThen maybe you can answer this,\u201d Rishe said. \u201cWhy is Prince Arnold so very intent on making me his wife?\u201d\nOliver hesitated, as if weighing the pros and cons of speaking, \u201cTo be quite honest, I was as surprised as you were. He\u2019s always insisted he had no interest in marriage. But the sight of you in Hermity has changed his mind. Apparently.\u201d\nSo not even his attendant understood his motives. Rishe remained at a complete loss.\n\u201cIf I may, however?\u201d Oliver mistook Rishe\u2019s confusion for anxiety and added, \u201cI have served Prince Arnold for a long time, and never before have I seen him so happy. When he is with you, he laughs. His smiles are sincere.\u201d\nRishe was taken aback. She\u2019d figured all of Arnold\u2019s laughter and teasing was at her expense. His own private jokes.\n\u201cAre you\u2026unhappy with him?\u201d Oliver ventured. \u201cWith his looks, His Highness is exceedingly popular with the ladies of the court, you know.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m sure he has many admirers.\u201d She paused. \u201cWould you really call the way he acts around me \u2018happy\u2019? To me, it seems more like a cat with a mouse.\u201d\nOliver laughed. He didn\u2019t deny it. \u201cI am pleased you understand His Highness so well. Oh, I nearly forgot. Here.\u201d\nHe held out a sheaf of three documents. \u201cThis is the guest list for your wedding. His Highness bids you look over it.\u201d\n\u201cThank you,\u201d Rishe said, pleasantly surprised. She hadn\u2019t even needed to ask. She gave it a quick glance, quickly identifying the most prominent and powerful names.\nKing Zahad, Prince Kyle, Princess Harriet. And from the Kingdom of Domana, we have Lord Jonal attending as the representative of the king. No surprise there.\nMore than a wedding guest register, this was a list of key people from the countries Arnold would go on to antagonize. Even before the murder of the king and",
    "query_text": " the start of the war, there must have been a trigger\u2014a sea change in the affairs of state. Everyone on this list was most likely involved.\nKing Zahad. I hope we can be friends again like in my first life. Hmm\u2026 Prince Kyle is rather frail. I hope he isn\u2019t working himself too hard. He has a strong sense of responsibility\u2014he\u2019ll attend the wedding even though it\u2019ll be a long trip.\nThe sight of these names filled Rishe with a longing for those lives, for the people she\u2019d once known. And sometime in the very near future, they would all be Galkhein\u2019s enemies.\nIf I take matters into my own hands, perhaps I can salvage some of these relationships before they sour. Even if we aren\u2019t allies, we don\u2019t have to be enemies. Anything to stave off the outbreak"

    "prefix_text": ". Rishe stood in the midst of the carnage, breath ragged as she gripped the hilt of her sword, slick with her own blood. She was the last line of defense. The chamber behind her housed the royal family.\nIf they could reach the hidden passageways, the young prince and his party could find shelter with their allies across the border. Rishe and the other knights were prepared to sacrifice their lives to allow the royal family to survive. Their escape meant victory.\nBells tolled out, urging flight. All is lost. Run. Rishe managed to graze Arnold\u2019s cheek with her blade before she looked down to find his jet-black sword blooming out of her chest.\nShe remembered how it burned, as if the blade was made of fire. It was heat, not pain, but her breathing grew labored, and when Emperor Arnold Hein withdrew his sword, Rishe crumpled. \nHe knelt by her side and whispered something.\nThe words were seared into her memory. Rishe squeezed Arnold\u2019s hand as they danced.\nI\u2019ll be the bully this time. \nRishe shifted her weight back, slipping out of the hold on her waist. She broke Arnold\u2019s lead and spun, drifting on the harmony of the dance. She took him by surprise; his eyes went wide.\nI wonder what you\u2019ll do when you\u2019re no longer on top, Your Highness. Her smile was a declaration of war. Watching him attempt to follow her lead would be delightful. She pulled his hand toward her, attempting to move them into a spin.\nBut Arnold held fast. He planted his hand on her waist and turned them in a different direction, using her inertia against her. Hey! As a result, Rishe twirled by herself on the spot.\nShe didn\u2019t miss a step. She turned elegantly, the hem of her dress whispering across the ballroom floor. She heard appreciative murmurs from the wallflowers lined up watching.\nDespite that, Rishe took it as a defeat. Round one to Arnold. \nSo\u2026you can think on your feet. How about this?\nArnold remained unruffled, evading her next scheme like it was nothing. He grinned down at her, his eyes shining with a dare.\nHe thinks I can\u2019t beat him. His ease vexed her, but it was his smugness that made her angry.\nShe let out a hard breath, attempting a maneuver to lure him in while turning. He leaned back, not falling for it at all.\nHe\u2019s just too good at changing his center of gravity! She kept her astonishment under wraps, but she felt it. Despite how close we\u2019re dancing, I can\u2019t throw off his timing at all. He\u2019s sidestepped all my attempts, and he takes back the lead the second I let down my guard!\nIt made her increasingly angry. She twirled and stepped as the dance dictated, all the while feeling out for moments of weakness. Arnold played along with her game, completely unruffled.\nEvery single time. I\u2019m doing my utmost to trip him up, but he doesn\u2019t even seem annoyed! At this point she\u2019d just settle for any reaction at all.\nTheir unusual dance style had gathered a crowd. Rishe paid them no mind, focused only on her goal. Then something occurred to her, and her breath caught in her throat.\nWait a minute, he has left an opening. It\u2019s the same one from before. She thought back to their fight to the death, to that moment when she had managed to draw blood. That may indeed have been his only weakness.\nIf I strike the same way\u2014huh? Before she could try, Arnold appeared to lose patience, wrapping his arm around her waist. He bent her back into a dip so deep it felt like he\u2019d pulled a carpet from under her feet. She yelped, grabbing at him reflexively, clinging tight. His big hands gripped her securely enough to mitigate the sensation of falling. Relief flooded through her, and she felt a laugh rumble against her ear.\nThe music came to an end with one last ringing note. She blinked. The dance is over?\nA hush fell over the ballroom. Then cheers broke out, followed by a round of applause.\n\u201cThat was incredible!\u201d\nThe watching nobles crowded in.\n\u201cYou two moved in such perfect harmony!\u201d\n\u201cI was on the edge of my seat. I felt like I was watching a sword duel!\u201d\n\u201cIs this a dance from Hermity? I\u2019ve never seen such steps before.\u201d\n\u201cUh, well\u2026\u201d Rishe floundered. She glanced up at Arnold, who appeared to be enjoying her struggle. She\u2019d get no help from him.\nRishe dealt with the barrage of questions as best she could, letting the crowd sweep them into the dining room, which was set up for a buffet-style meal. She made sure to greet every guest, riveting their faces into her memory.\nShe must have been acting peculiar, because Arnold eventually said, \u201cRishe, I think the wine is getting to you. Shall we get some fresh air?\u201d\nRishe hadn\u2019t touched a single drop. In fact, she\u2019d been caught up in so many conversations that she hadn\u2019t even had the chance to eat, but she had experience working on an empty stomach. She accepted Arnold\u2019s encouragement as the escape it was.\nJust when I least expect it, he\u2019ll act the gentleman. Maybe he\u2019d remembered her demand for a carefree life of doing nothing.\nRishe cast a charming look across the crowd. \u201cThank you for your consideration, Your Highness. Forgive me.\u201d She gave a polite bow before quietly slipping away. \nShe didn\u2019t head straight to the balcony but rather slowly walked around the hall. There was only so much she could find out glued to Arnold\u2019s side all night.\nI need information. Galkhein\u2019s political landscape was a mystery to me through all my past lives. I only know the rumors that made it abroad.\nAlthough she knew of Arnold\u2019s eventual patricide, she had no concept of the circumstances leading up to it. She needed a better picture of the factions and power balance inside the court. The lives these people led.\nI know better than to believe wartime gossip. This Arnold Hein is a lot different from what I\u2019d heard he was like at nineteen. He\u2019s not as diabolical as the rumors led me to believe. He likes to push, but he isn\u2019t unkind. The thought drifted across her mind, leaving her conflicted. Well, he\u2019s not unkind now. But I still don\u2019t like not knowing his motives. And he\u2019s a bit of a jerk, to be honest. \nShe tried to settle her mind and just observe. Gathering intelligence was necessary to lead a long, carefree life lazing around the palace.\nIf I recall correctly, that\u2019s Lord Hannawald. He seems to be on good terms with Count Gayle. Duke Hudemann and Duke Teinitz are having a friendly enough conversation, yet they don\u2019t seem close. Rishe ticked off the names of people she\u2019d met, committing them to memory.\nA wave of sweet perfume wafted over her. A pretty girl with soft blonde hair had appeared at her side. \u201cHow do you do, Lady Rishe? I\u2019m Cornelia Thea Toona.\u201d\nDuke Toona\u2019s family was the thirty-first house she\u2019d met tonight.\nRishe smiled graciously. \u201cRishe Irmgard Weitzner. A pleasure to meet you.\u201d\n\u201cThe pleasure is all mine.\u201d Cornelia smiled sweetly. Her eyes were big and bright, her lips full. She held a glass in each hand and offered one to Rishe. \u201cWine? I see you\u2019re empty-handed.\u201d\nA gaggle of other ladies nearby began giggling among themselves.\n\u201cHow dare she act so haughty when she\u2019s a captive. It\u2019s time for her learn just what she is. A pawn to be played and discarded.\u201d\n\u201cShe should enjoy her time on Prince Arnold\u2019s arm while she can.\u201d\n\u201cShe is from a minor nation, after all.\u201d\nAs Rishe took note of their whispers, Cornelia gazed at her with doe eyes. \u201cDoes my offering offend you in some way?\u201d\nIf I remember correctly, House Toona holds a vast territory in southern Galkhein.\nRishe held out a hand to accept the glass. \u201cHow could it? Thank you, Lady Cornelia.\u201d\nBefore Rishe could touch the glass, Cornelia gave a dramatic shout. \u201cOh dear! My hand slipped!\u201d She dropped it, quite obviously on purpose. Without thinking, Rishe grabbed her skirts and leaned back, plucking the glass out of the air with the other hand.\nCornelia let out a cry of surprise as Rishe caught the wine before any could spill. She swirled the glass and brought it to her nose to breathe in the bouquet.\nHmm\u2026 That\u2019s mashed capsicum. Where did she even get that? What a waste of perfectly good wine. And why bother spicing it enough to singe the tongue if she just planned to ruin my dress? Pick a plan, my dear.\nHiding her exasperation, Rishe smiled brightly. \u201cI\u2019ve never had a wine quite like this. What an unusual scent.\u201d\nCornelia bit her lip in frustration. Rishe beamed at her. You\u2019ve got such a pretty face, Lady Toona. Why don\u2019t you smile?\nRishe leaned in close to Cornelia. \u201cThis vintage isn\u2019t available where I\u2019m from. I\u2019m ever so anxious to learn more. Should I perhaps invite Prince Arnold over to enjoy a glass? Which tray did you get this from?\u201d\n\u201cWhat? Oh, um\u2026\u201d Rishe had a policy of never backing down from a fight, but it seemed Cornelia didn\u2019t share it. \u201cS-sorry, but I don\u2019t remember. Such a large hall, you see.\u201d\n\u201cA shame. I\u2019ll just give His Highness this one, then. I\u2019ll be sure to let him know who it\u2019s from.\u201d\n\u201cUh, wait!\u201d Cornelia rapidly shook her head. \u201cI-I got that glass for you, so I think you should\u2014you know what? Never mind! Maybe I should just take that\u2014oh no!\u201d\nRishe ignored the ashen-faced Cornelia, raising the glass and swallowing down a gulp. \n\u201cI-I can\u2019t believe\u2026\u201d\n\u201cSuch a spicy flavor, just as I imagined.\u201d Rishe smiled again to the assembled group\u2019s astonishment. \u201cWhat a warm welcome. I do hope the two of us can spend more time together. Perhaps\u2026a tea party?\u201d\n\u201cTh-the two of us?\u201d Cornelia stammered.\n\u201cYes. I want to know all about House Toona.\u201d\nCornelia looked flabbergasted, but she recovered herself and nodded.\nThat should do. One of Rishe\u2019s eventual plans required a plot of land in a temperate climate. House Toona\u2019s would likely be perfect, but she needed to confirm a few things with Cornelia. Never back down from a fight. Even further\u2026\nShe recalled the words of her mentor from her days as a merchant.\nDon\u2019t bother with fights you can\u2019t win.\nThe other ladies fled, fearful of this strange girl who gulped down painfully spicy wine like it was nothing. \n \n***\n \nRishe retreated to the empty balcony to enjoy the music, grimacing with every stinging mouthful of wine. She drank it in decreasing sips until Arnold joined her.\n\u201cWhat are you making that face for?\u201d\nRishe swirled the glass. \u201cDon\u2019t worry, it\u2019s not you. It\u2019s just this wine is so spicy.\u201d\n\u201cSpicy? The wine is?\u201d\n\u201cMm. It\u2019s seasoned with capsicum. I barely managed to get that first mouthful down without gagging.\u201d\nArnold swiped the glass from her hand. \u201cDon\u2019t tell me this was a poisoning attempt!\u201d\nRishe clicked her tongue in annoyance at her own lack of vigilance. No one else would be able to grab something from her so easily.\nArnold glared at the wine. \u201cYou don\u2019t need to drink this. I\u2019ll get rid of it.\u201d\n\u201cHey, give that back! They ruined a perfectly good glass of wine because of me. I\u2019m not going to waste it.\u201d She grabbed it back and took another sip, shuddering at the taste.\nArnold glowered. \u201cTell me who did this. I\u2019ll have them executed.\u201d\n\u201cDon\u2019t be ridiculous. You don\u2019t kill people like her\u2014you use them.\u201d Just the tiniest bit of wine to go, but it was getting harder to make herself drink it. She gave the glass a reproachful look, then glanced back at Arnold. \u201cOh, and I owe you an apology.\u201d\n\u201cDo you?\u201d\n\u201cI used your name to defend myself.\u201d The girls had only backed off when she threatened to tattle to Arnold. Rishe found that sort of thing inelegant in the extreme, and she was embarrassed.\nArnold sighed",
    "query_text": " at Rishe\u2019s apologetic bow. \u201cThere\u2019s nothing wrong with a wife invoking her husband\u2019s name.\u201d\nRishe hesitated. \u201cWe\u2019re not married yet.\u201d\n\u201cThat\u2019s a formality. It\u2019s as good as done, if you ask me.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2026see.\u201d\nHe took her distraction as an"

They wore their nerves plainly on their sleeves. \n\u201cHey, I thought this palace was in a terrible state of neglect,\u201d one maid whispered. \u201cWhy is it so sparkling clean?\u201d\n\u201cYeah, you\u2019re right,\u201d said another. \u201cSomeone must have sorted it out before we arrived.\u201d\n\u201cI wonder what kind of person Lady Rishe is.

Diana\u2019s chest ached with anticipation as heels clicked on the floor, approaching the line of girls. From the corner of their eyes, the maids saw a wide-skirted court dress. A gentle scent washed over them.\nWithout even looking at her, they could tell Crown Princess Rishe was a lovely woman. Diana and her friends swelled with pride that she was to become their mistress.\nBut then Laura whispered to Diana, \u201cHey, isn\u2019t this scent familiar?\u201d\n\u201cQuiet!\u201d Clearly it was some sort of expensive perfume. Or so Diana thought, but then she realized what it was. The words just slipped out. \u201cIt\u2019s soap.\u201d\n\u201cHuh? Did you just say something?\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s soap. The same kind we always use.\u201d Diana was sure of it.\nThe princess said, \u201cPlease rise.\u201d \nWhy did her voice sound so familiar? An incredible foreboding gripping her, Diana looked up. She gasped.\n\u201cMy name is Rishe Irmgard Weitzner.\u201d\nBefore her stood the beautiful newcomer\u2014the thorn in her side for the past few days. The smile she wore was peaceful and just the slightest bit satisfied.\n \n***\n \nI\u2019m so glad I managed to finish washing the sheets in time!\nStanding before the maids with Arnold\u2019s attendant Oliver at her side, Rishe was panicking on the inside. She\u2019d had so much to do this morning that she\u2019d put off the laundry to the last minute. She took deep, controlled breaths, praying no one would notice that she\u2019d raced here at a dead sprint.\nOliver was none the wiser as he spoke to the assembled girls. Rishe took the opportunity to look them over. She locked eyes with Elsie, who was gaping at her. It was a nice change\u2014usually her face was as blank as a rock wall.\nI\u2019m sorry for the deception. I figured blending in would give me the best picture of your working conditions.\nThe new maids wore similarly shocked expressions, while others watched her with delight. Meanwhile, the veterans, including Diana, had all gone pale. They trembled, stunned into silence. One seemed locked in a terrifying trance, while another looked on the verge of tears. All of them had spoken to Rishe with derision. As the ringleader, Diana was covering her mouth with both hands, like she was holding in a scream.\nOliver had finished his introduction. \u201cYour Highness, if you would?\u201d\nRishe stepped forward. \u201cFirst, I must apologize to you for what has transpired prior to this meeting. My deception, that is. However, it has granted me insight into how each one of you works.\u201d\nOliver\u2019s face creased in confusion. The newcomer maids began to panic, whispering among themselves.\n\u201cDoesn\u2019t this mean that she helped us out with the laundry?\u201d\n\u201cWe\u2019re going to be fired!\u201d\n\u201cIf I lose my position, my brother will have to quit school!\u201d\nNoticing the commotion, Oliver glanced at Rishe. \u201cYour Highness, two-thirds of these maids are newly recruited from the city. Since the majority of the castle maids were elderly, His Highness assumed you would prefer maids closer in age to yourself.\u201d\nRishe was startled. She had found it odd that most of her potential servants were new hires, but she hadn\u2019t expected this to be the reason.\n\u201cWhile the prince has entrusted the selection of your maids to you,\u201d Oliver went on. \u201cHiring someone with no experience will not do. Despite Prince Arnold\u2019s views, I urge you to reject the newcomers.\u201d\n\u201cOliver.\u201d\n\u201cI have a list of their names here. Elsie\u2014\u201d\n\u201cElsie, Nichole, Hilde, Marguerite, Rosa.\u201d Rishe began listing the names of the newly recruited maids. She\u2019d made a point to memorize them in the washhouse. \u201cElke, Amelia, and\u2014\u201d\nOliver looked at her wildly. \u201cYou know them all?! Even though they\u2019ve never served you in the past?\u201d\n\u201cYes, of course I do. Servants are essential to the maintenance of our lifestyle, why wouldn\u2019t I get to know them?\u201d Rishe listed the remaining names for good measure. \u201cAll twenty of you, listen to me.\u201d \nThe new maids stiffened. Diana and the other maids whose names hadn\u2019t been called were getting their wind back, wearing increasingly triumphant looks.\nRishe said, \u201cThe twenty names I just called will be my maids.\u201d\nTime seemed to stand still a moment, and then Oliver broke in with an astonished, \u201cB-but, my lady! They are all inexperienced\u2014\u201d\n\u201cYes. And my palace will be the perfect place to learn.\u201d\nThe new recruits were completely speechless, unsure of exactly what was happening. \nRishe smiled at Elsie. \u201cI hope you\u2019ll serve me well, Elsie.\u201d\nElsie was still frozen in place. \u201cHuh? Y-yes, my lady, but\u2014\u201d\nA shaking Diana cried out, \u201cBut why, my lady?! You\u2019ve",
    "query_text": " seen their work! They\u2019re useless, the lot of them! The rest of us get so much more done in a shorter amount of time!\u201d\n\u201cWatch your tongue, girl,\u201d Oliver said sharply.\nDiana ignored him. \u201cWe\u2019re hard workers! Any job you assign us, we can do it! Please, I beg you, my lady!\u201d\n\u201cStep back,\u201d Oliver warned. \u201cDo not take a single step closer to Lady Rishe.\u201d\nDiana spoke in a rush, words pouring out of her. \u201c"

    "prefix_text": " heard of you.\u201d\nArnold donned an amused smile. \u201cYou plant your weight like a trained swordswoman. Your center of gravity is perfect.\u201d\n\u201cYou exaggerate,\u201d Rishe demurred. \u201cThat was simply a curtsy to an esteemed guest.\u201d \n\u201cI must have misheard, but I swear you called me \u2018emperor\u2019 just now.\u201d \nRishe froze.\n\u201cMy father yet lives,\u201d Arnold said. \u201cI am simply a crown prince. Why would you call me that?\u201d \n\u201cUh, um\u2026\u201d Rishe floundered for an answer.\nShe\u2019d made such a foolish mistake. Arnold\u2019s gaze cut right through her. It felt like he\u2019d see through any lie she told right down to her soul. She remembered this from the battlefield\u2014how his attention alone felt like a sword thrust.\nBut why even bother to lie? They\u2019d never meet again, so who cared what he thought of her? Sure, she harbored a hard feeling or two over the recent slaying, but there was no point complaining about it to this Arnold. Calling him the emperor was boorish, but Rishe was in the process of being forcibly exiled. Why play at diplomacy?\nShe took a deep breath and bowed low. This was not the curtsy of a noble lady but of a servant bowing in supplication to her master.\n\u201cMy humblest apologies, Your Highness. I was in a rush. Such a rude slip of the tongue.\u201d She raised her head. \u201cMy ex-fianc\u00e9 just annulled our engagement, so I\u2019ve got a lot on my mind. If you would excuse me.\u201d \n\u201cHe annulled your engagement?\u201d\nAt that, Rishe turned and fled.\nThis unexpected run-in with Arnold had taken up valuable time. She threw open the door to the balcony and hiked up her skirts, kicking off her shoes in anticipation of jumping into a tree. Looking down, she realized the ground was far closer than she\u2019d feared.\nExcellent! I can just drop into the garden!\nArnold, who up until now had been rendered speechless, shook himself out of his fugue as Rishe clambered over the railing. \u201cHey!\u201d\nRishe\u2019s moonlight-silver dress flowed around her as she leapt. The lawn was soft, but the fall was still far enough to risk injury.\nWeight evenly distributed on the soles of my feet, roll to transfer the impact to my shins and thighs, then onto my hips and my back.\nShe landed safely, rolled nimbly in her dress, and popped back up. Her hair was covered in leaves. \nI need to hurry up!\nBracing against a nearby rock, she used her weight to snap the heels off of her shoes. There. That would make running a little easier. Satisfied, she slipped them back on and made haste toward the family estate. \n \n***\n \nUp on the balcony, Crown Prince Arnold of Galkhein watched the spectacle play out from beginning to end. He gazed at the girl with the coral hair. Her appearance was that of any young noblewoman, but she moved like a well-trained knight. She\u2019d leapt from the balcony and landed skillfully, showing no signs of distress at her ripped dress or disheveled hair. Instead, she\u2019d knocked the heels off her shoes and dashed away.\nAlso, she had called him an emperor.\nPlaying it all over again in his head, Arnold broke out into a rare chuckle. As his shoulders quivered with laughter, his attendant approached him from behind.\n\u201cThere you are, Your Highness. What are you doing out here? I\u2019m aware you don\u2019t desire a wife, but beginning the search would be wise\u2026 Er, Your Highness?\u201d The attendant\u2019s eyes flew wide. His bored and scowling master was laughing. \u201cDid something happen?\u201d\n\u201cOliver, ready my coach. Wait, no. That will take too much time. Bring me a horse.\u201d\n\u201cAt once, Your Highness. Might I ask why?\u201d\nArnold didn\u2019t respond\u2014he just grinned like a hungry wolf catching scent of his prey.\n \n***\n \nOnce outside the palace gates, Rishe threw herself into the waiting coach, shouting for the driver to make haste. She stopped it a few hundred yards from the manor and bid him farewell. \u201cI\u2019m leaving! Thanks for always being such a safe driver, Daniel!\u201d\nThe road to the manor was muddy from a morning rain shower. She knew from her second life that the coach would get stuck, resulting in a loss of valuable time. It was better to just get out and run. \n\u201cHuff, huff.\u201d Despite her last life\u2019s physical conditioning, this body had no stamina. She\u2019d need to try to get fitter faster this time around.\nRishe reached the end of the road, and her heart promptly sank all the way to her feet. \u201cOh no.\u201d\nThe front door was thronged with people, all of them surrounding a carriage bearing the royal family\u2019s coat of arms.\nI need to get out of here.\nWhile she stood frozen in indecision, one of the knights doing crowd control shouted, \u201cYour Highness! I have eyes on Lady Rishe!\u201d\n\u201cGet out of my way!\u201d A familiar voice started up a bellow. \u201cLet me through! Rishe, how dare you make me wait so long?\u201d\nRishe\u2019s ex-fianc\u00e9, Crown Prince Dietrich, stepped triumphantly forward.\n\u201cI know the thought of hearing your crimes enumerated by the man you love must pain you, but alas, as future king, it is my duty to bring down the hammer of justice upon a villainess such as yourself!\u201d\n\u201cI see I\u2019ve timed it badly,\u201d Rishe muttered. \u201cIn fact, this is my worst loop yet. I\u2019d rather be barred from the house than see you again.\u201d\n\u201cHmm? What are you grumbling about?\u201d Dietrich looked Rishe up and down. \u201cI knew it. You put on a brave face, but I can sense the sorrow in your heart.\u201d\n\u201cI beg your pardon?\u201d\n\u201cYour heart!\u201d the prince repeated. \u201cYour heart! It must be absolutely crushed! Because I called off our engagement!\u201d\nRishe wasn\u2019t sure where he was drawing these conclusions from. Possibly the same place he mined for all his bottomless self-confidence.\n\u201cI can tell you\u2019ve been wandering aimlessly, distraught,\u201d the prince went on. \u201cLook at you. Your dress is caked in mud, your shoes are broken, and there are cuts marring your face and arms. What other possible cause could there be than heartbreak?\u201d\nRishe narrowed her eyes. \u201cDo you ever stop to think about the words coming out of your mouth?\u201d\n\u201cWhat?\u201d\nHis interpretation of events was fanciful to the point of absurdity. \u201cI did not dirty my dress or snap my shoes out of heartbreak. Because I feel none. You\u2019ve always been a little slow, so I\u2019ll make this clear: I do not have a single shred of fondness for you, or for our broken engagement.\u201d\n\u201cWhat?!\u201d the prince said. \u201cWhat are you saying?!\u201d\nThe surrounding crowd began to snicker.\n\u201cIsn\u2019t that the crown prince? Did Lady Rishe just dump him?\u201d\n\u201cWait, but wasn\u2019t he trying to dump her?\u201d\n\u201cCan\u2019t be! Look at her! She doesn\u2019t care at all!\u201d\n\u201cHow dare you nobodies make sport of me?\u201d Dietrich screeched. \u201cI am your prince!\u201d\nTemper aside, Dietrich was a handsome man. He had azure-blue eyes and blond hair\u2014a prince straight out of a picture book. His looks and place in the succession meant a never-ending swarm of women vying for his affections. He was brought up a pampered princeling, never wanting for anything. It manifested in a pompous manner and an overconfidence in his own abilities. Rishe had cautioned him about his attitude before, but he never paid her any mind.\nI\u2019m so glad I don\u2019t have to marry him.\nShe wished she could go back and tell the shocked, scared girl from her first life not to worry about her shattered engagement. Still, she might as well say it all here and now, with the assembled knights and citizens to bear witness.\n\u201cYour Highness, you exist to love and protect your people. It\u2019s unbecoming to speak of them in this manner.\u201d\n\u201cYou\u2019re the unbecoming one!\u201d the prince snapped. \u201cBeg me for forgiveness!\u201d\n\u201cI won\u2019t. Calling off our betrothal is the best course, and I applaud Your Highness for your good sense.\u201d\nNow even the knights were trembling with suppressed mirth. \nDietrich was turning red. \u201cD-don\u2019t laugh at me!\u201d\n\u201cLady Rishe,\u201d came a sweet voice. \u201cAren\u2019t you ashamed of yourself?\u201d \nRishe fought down a groan.\nOut of the crowd stepped a charming, dainty girl. Her big eyes moist with tears, she took her place at",

You\u2019re here.\u201d Rishe sighed. \u201cHow nice.\u201d\nThe young Mary scowled through her tears. Hidden behind her skirts, Dietrich continued to shout his disapproval. \u201cRishe! You\u2019ve brought my beloved Mary to tears! She\u2019s told me everything. How you bullied her, ridiculed her. How you find it amusing to lock her in the classroom overnight! Such a wicked woman could never be queen!\u201d\nNone of that\u2019s true.\nRishe glanced at Mary, who averted her gaze a little awkwardly.\n\u201cMore importantly,\u201d Rishe said, \u201chave you already brought your concerns to my parents, Your Highness?\u201d\n\u201cMore importantly?!

    "prefix_text": " resolved to keep her loops a secret. \u201cI had plans for my exile. A brand-new life. And now because of you, my parents are involved. Even the king has heard about it!\u201d\nAfter Rishe rejected Arnold, Dietrich had immediately cried out, \u201cTh-the crown prince of Galkhein proposed to Rishe?!\u201d\nHis shrieks were loud enough to attract the attention of the master and mistress of the manor.\nWhen her parents came out, Rishe had protested, \u201cI\u2019m not going to marry him! I\u2019m leaving the country just as Dietrich commanded.\u201d\nNo one listened. Their faces just paled with nervous confusion.\nJust then, a glittering coach arrived. Half-stuck in the mud, the man inside it was forced to trudge over the swampy ground, and so the king of Hermity himself arrived, staggering and dirt-stained. \nHe grabbed hold of his son\u2019s collar, pushing him into a low bow. He then turned to Prince Arnold and said, rather loudly, \u201cYour Highness! Allow me to apologize for my son\u2019s foolishness! You are an esteemed guest all the way from Galkhein! It is unthinkable he would not offer you the courtesy you are due!\u201d\n\u201cYou\u2019re hurting me, Father! My back!\u201d\nThe king then turned to Rishe. \u201cMy lady, allow me to sincerely apologize as both a king and a father. My son\u2019s behavior toward you has been utterly disgraceful. I beg you to please give Prince Arnold\u2019s proposal due consideration. Not only for your own sake but for the sake of your country.\u201d\nThe king bowed to her as deeply as his son had to Arnold, and her parents joined him. Rishe felt dizzy at the sight of this abject debasement in the presence of citizens.\nArnold, who had been watching the proceedings with a detached amusement, sobered and stepped toward the king. \u201cYour Majesty, please rise.\u201d\nWithout the smirk, Arnold\u2019s face immediately reverted to its cold mask. The king didn\u2019t move. Maybe something in Arnold\u2019s voice kept him frozen.\n\u201cSuch a trifle won\u2019t cause discord between our kingdoms,\u201d he went on. \u201cHowever, I would beg a little time to speak with Lady Rishe.\u201d\nLater, Rishe would learn that Arnold\u2019s attendant had spoken to the king\u2019s own gentleman, certain that his words would reach their target. \u201cMy master took such trouble to attend these festivities, and this is the welcome he is offered? I wonder, what will the emperor think when he learns of his son\u2019s slighting at your nation\u2019s hands?\u201d\n\u201cIf you would, Lady Rishe?\u201d The plump king looked to be on the verge of tears.\nRishe had no obligation to accept and no desire to spend a moment longer in this country than was absolutely necessary. But acquiescence seemed the fastest way to move things along.\nAs her mind whirled, Arnold leaned in to whisper, \u201cIf you refuse to hear my suit, you won\u2019t deter me. I\u2019ll simply move on to Plan B.\u201d\nAnd that was how she found herself in one of the palace\u2019s parlors, here to \u201cjust talk\u201d to Prince Arnold. The ball guests were all gone. It was just the two of them.\n\u201cI want to know what you\u2019re planning,\u201d Rishe said flatly.\n\u201cPlanning? Me?\u201d\n\u201cBy asking me to marry you. You don\u2019t know me. A proposal like this wouldn\u2019t come out of the blue.\u201d\nThis man was destined to become an aggressive warmonger over the next few years. He wouldn\u2019t do anything without a dozen motives.\nPrince Arnold just smiled. \u201cI have no plans. I\u2019m simply enamored with you.\u201d\n\u201cEnamored\u2026?\u201d\nThat was the last thing she\u2019d expected him to say. Asking him to elaborate didn\u2019t seem worth the breath\u2014he was obviously lying. As if this ruthless, inhuman creature with ice in his veins could feel even a flicker of affection.\n\u201cWhy refuse me?\u201d Arnold asked. \u201cYour engagement is broken, you\u2019re on the verge of exile, and you have no faction or supporters. At this rate, you\u2019ll be dead within a fortnight. I\u2019d call my offer a stroke of unbelievable fortune.\u201d\n\u201cYou\u2019re not wrong,\u201d Rishe admitted. \u201cOnce upon a time, I would have jumped at your offer.\u201d\nIf it had been made in her first life, for instance. But now Rishe knew better. Her life was only just getting started, and the future held endless possibilities. After the horror of her sixth loop, she yearned for freedom.\nI don\u2019t want to marry him. I won\u2019t be anyone\u2019s captive. Still\u2026\nRishe, more than anyone, knew that the slightest adjustment could enact profound changes on the trajectory of a life. No doubt she\u2019d have many more lives, but this could be the only one where marriage to Arnold would be an option.\nThe dread emperor. The tyrant. The man who will stoke the fires of war. \nRishe knew the gossip, the endless conjecture behind Arnold Hein\u2019s bloody reign, but she didn\u2019t know the truth.\nWhy? The question had haunted her since her first life. She\u2019d never before had the chance to even speak to him.\nShe had wondered it as a merchant, hearing of the distant outbreak of war. She\u2019d wondered when the news of the dead and dying reached her apothecary. When she had comforted her terrified mistress in her life as a maid, assuring her everything would be all right. When she squared off against him in battle, as he plunged a sword through her heart\u2014even then she wondered. \nIf I stick around, maybe I\u2019ll finally have my answer. Half of her was dying to know. The other half didn\u2019t give a damn. And yet\u2026\nShe recalled a childhood dream. Rather, a longing.\nRishe let out a breath. \u201cYou claim you are enamored with me.\u201d\n\u201cYes. I am completely under your spell.\u201d\nTo think he could spout such nonsense with a straight face!\n\u201cThen will you grant me anything I desire?\u201d\n\u201cSo long as it is within my power,\u201d Arnold said. \u201cAnything you want will be yours.\u201d\nRishe hesitated, gathering her thoughts. \u201cI have some conditions.\u201d Arnold silently motioned for her to go on. \u201cI want full control over the wedding festivities. Everything must be procured through merchants of my choosing.\u201d\n\u201cFine.\u201d Arnold nodded. \u201cYou\u2019re free to do business with whomever you wish.\u201d\n\u201cAfter we are married, I must be in a position to mingle with guests from abroad.\u201d\n\u201cThat sounds within the purview of the crown princess. Anything else?\u201d\n\u201cI will be allowed to live in a separate residence from your mother and father.\u201d\nShe meant this seriously, but it made Arnold laugh. \u201cYou don\u2019t seem the type to worry about an overbearing mother-in-law.\u201d\n\u201cYou would be surprised. Combative relationships with one\u2019s new family are the most difficult part of marriage, or so they say. It could be a ramshackle cottage for all I care\u2014I just require a secondary residence.\u201d\nActually, Rishe didn\u2019t care at all about in-laws. When Arnold set his war into motion, his first move would be the assassination of his father. A genuine coup by patricide, not at all like Dietrich\u2019s clumsy attempt. Next, he would name himself emperor, take control of the country, and mobilize the military.\nSeparating him from his parents will make the first step more difficult\u2014although not impossible, unfortunately.\n\u201cAnything else?\u201d Arnold asked. \u201cI\u2019ll do whatever it takes to marry you.\u201d\n\u201cIdeally, I\u2019d like to know your endgame,\u201d Rishe said with dignity. \u201cBut as I doubt there\u2019s any chance of that, I have one final request.\u201d She jabbed a finger into his face, regardless of how rude it was. \u201cI will spend my time idling around the castle. No work, no study. I shall be utterly useless.\u201d\nLet\u2019s see just how much you want me as your princess.\nAfter a long moment of silence, Arnold cracked a merry laugh. The proposal remained; all her conditions were met.\n\n(2) chapter number given is likely out of range: 0\nChapter: 7\n\nChapter 2\nChapter 2\n \n\u201cYOU KNOW, it was only after I went into commerce that I truly had a dream for the future,\u201d Rishe had once confided in a friend. \u201cUp until then, I existed only as the crown prince\u2019s fianc\u00e9e or my father\u2019s daughter. My every act was to become more worthy of that status. But now, for the first time, I actually have a goal of my own.\u201d\n\u201cOh, yeah?\u201d her friend said. He was the ruler of the desert kingdom, and his smile was awfully charming. \u201cWhat\u2019s that?\u201d\nRishe smiled back. \u201cI want to travel to every single country in the world. I want to see everything in every town, peruse their markets, and meet the eyes of every person who lives there!\u201d\nBy now, that felt like such a distant dream.\n \n***\n \nRishe awoke with a start, eyes snapping open as she sensed a disturbance in the air.\nShe unsheathed her sword halfway, primed for danger. \nInside the coach, her old enemy sat across from",

Anyone would be reluctant to use medicine concocted by a complete stranger. But the longer we wait, the harder the poison will become to cure. \nShe needed to dispel their doubts. Rolling up her sleeve, Rishe approached Arnold and drew his sword from its scabbard. \u201cI need to borrow this for a moment, Your Highness.\u201d\n\u201cWhat are you\u2014\u201d\nShe pushed the blade against the soft skin of her inner arm. Blood welled up, along with the sharp sting of pain. Nothing compared to her injuries sustained during her life as a knight, though.\nArnold did not share her nonchalance. \u201cWhat do you think you\u2019re doing?!\u201d\nHe grabbed for her arm. She stepped out of his grasp. Was blood truly so shocking? She didn\u2019t have the time to worry about it. Clutching the overfull bowl, Rishe hurried back to the knights.\n\u201cDon\u2019t worry. This isn\u2019t poison,\u201d Rishe said. She demonstrated as much by drizzling it with a spoon over her own fresh wound. It stung. That meant the ingredients were working.\n\u201cThis is crushed liquori grass, luqua flowers, and carilya nuts. I\u2019ll swallow some if that\u2019s what it takes to prove it\u2019s safe.\u201d It was horribly bitter; she hoped it wouldn\u2019t come to that. \u201cThe paralysis will last for days. Please make up your mind quickly.\u201d\n\u201cMake up our mind?\u201d\n\u201cWill you allow me to cure the poison? Or would you rather drag paralyzed soldiers all the way to Galkhein? I suppose you could waste His Highness\u2019s time searching for a hunter\u2019s settlement to use their antidote.\u201d She smiled serenely. \u201cIt makes no difference to us. Right, Your Highness?\u201d\nIn the end, Rishe applied the antidote.\nThe recovery took a few hours. While they waited, Rishe picked herbs in the same meadow she\u2019d been gazing at with yearning from the carriage. A fortuitous turn of events. She found anti-inflammatory herbs and flowers to ease sour bellies, ingredients for curing headaches, and mushrooms for inducing slumber. She wrapped them all up in a handkerchief.\nIn the meantime, Arnold dispatched a messenger to this region\u2019s lord, making arrangements to deliver the apprehended bandits. After coordinating with Oliver, he drifted over to Rishe.\n\u201cI see your interest in flowers is mercenary, rather than ornamental,\u201d he said, surveying the heaps of herbs gathered on the bank of the pond. He sat down beside her.\nWhen he didn\u2019t say anything more, Rishe went back to work plucking leaves from plants with valuable stems. The leaves had no medicinal effects, but they did make a decent broth. Slumber mushroom spores were a nuisance unless dried; they were spread out beside her in the sun.\nI wonder, would he be annoyed if I attached herbs to the roof of the coach? That would be unusual adornment for a crown prince\u2019s retinue, but it wouldn\u2019t hurt to ask.\nShe realized, quite suddenly, that Arnold was looking at her. At her hands, specifically. He sat cross-legged with his chin propped on his fist, staring absently, like a kid watching a column of ants march by.\nWhat is so fascinating about herbs?\nTheir eyes met. \u201cAm I bothering you?\u201d he asked.\nRishe shook her head slowly. \u201cNot at all. I was just curious what caught your eye.\u201d\n\u201cNothing specific. I was just thinking how very unusual you are.\u201d He was smiling again. \u201cI\u2019m looking forward to how you\u2019ll surprise me next.\u201d\nLike I\u2019m some sort of rare pet he bought to entertain him. She didn\u2019t like that. Nothing she\u2019d done was at all remarkable\u2014normal tasks performed by a normal person.\n\u201cI didn\u2019t make that antidote for your amusement.\u201d\n\u201cI realize that.\u201d The instigating smile faded from his lips. \u201cYou know, those knights you coerced into taking your home-brewed medicine were all born in the slums.\u201d\n\u201cCoerced? That\u2019s hardly the word I\u2019d use.\u201d\n\u201cGalkhein claims to value merit above all else, but in the end, people are judged by where they came from. Despite this, those men fought their way up from nothing.\u201d\nRishe paused in plucking the seeds from a flower and looked up at Arnold.\n\u201cThe men with the worst cases of the paralysis were all newly assigned. They\u2019ve spent weeks training to ensure this mission was a success. That older knight\u2014the one who bowed to you\u2014sustained an injury protecting the rookies. He cares deeply about his men.\u201d\n\u201cYou seem to care about them too,\u201d Rishe commented.\n\u201cI handpicked them for my retinue.\u201d Arnold clambered to his feet, only to fall into a bow. \u201cAnd you kept them safe. You have my deepest gratitude.\u201d\nRishe found herself at a loss for words. Was this Arnold putting on a mask to hide the monster within? Or was this the real him? She remembered the way he\u2019d looked when he held his blade to the bandit\u2019s throat, like a child poised to break a toy he had grown bored of.\n\u201cDon\u2019t mention it,\u201d Rishe said, uncomfortable. \u201cI knew how to do it, so I did.\u201d\nArnold laughed softly. \u201cBe that as it may, I\u2019d still count a noblewoman who can brew remedies from wildflowers by the side of the road a rare find.\u201d\n\u201cEarlier, when you grabbed my wrist\u2026\u201d Rishe steered the subject away from her incongruous knowledge. \u201cYou broke your promise. You said you wouldn\u2019t touch me.\u201d\n\u201cThat was reflex,\u201d Arnold protested. \u201cI thought you were going to hurt yourself.\u201d\nSuch a simple conversation, so casual. It had Rishe feeling positively peculiar.\n\u201cWhy are your knights so wary around me?\u201d she asked. \n\u201cWary? Oh, they were all at the palace when you broke your first engagement. They\u2019re most likely concerned I\u2019m bringing home a villainous jilt who will lead to my ruin. Something silly like that.\u201d\n\u201cI see.\u201d Apparently, being dumped by a prince called into question one\u2019s herbalist abilities.\n\u201cI\u2019m glad you mentioned it,\u201d Arnold went on, \u201cbecause there may be people in Galkhein who will oppose our union. I will do everything in my power to protect you, but you must bring any insults or threats to me right away.\u201d\n\u201cAre there likely to be many?\u201d\n\u201cIn theory, the crown prince may choose his own wife, but the done thing is, of course, to marry a princess. I assume a duke\u2019s daughter would have at least some ties to the royal family?\u201d\nHe assumed correctly. She was in the family tree, if a rather distant branch.\n\u201cMy father has ordered me to choose a bride from a different kingdom rather than a woman of my own land because\u2014\u201d\n\u201cOne never knows when a hostage will come in handy,\u201d Rishe finished for him.\nGalkhein was an expansionist empire. Currently, peace reigned\u2014but peace was precarious. If Galkhein demanded any of the countries to hand over a princess bride, then none were in a position to refuse. With his daughter in the hands of a foreign power, no king would dare oppose a war that power cared to wage.\n\u201cI sent a message to my father telling him I happened upon a close relation of Hermity\u2019s king\u2014a duke\u2019s daughter who had been recently tossed aside by her fianc\u00e9e,\u201d Arnold said. \u201cI also may have implied I was the reason for your falling out\u2014yours and the prince\u2019s. Why, when I saw a woman so powerful and connected and beloved, I couldn\u2019t help but plunder you.\u201d\n\u201cPlunder me? That\u2019s certainly one way to describe it.\u201d Dietrich had kicked up an almighty fuss, despite being the one who broke the engagement.\n\u201cMy father approves of you because he sees you as a bargaining chip. There will be others who aren\u2019t prepared to accept you so willingly.\u201d\n\u201cIs that so?\u201d Rishe said steadily.\n\u201cNever fear,\u201d Arnold responded. \u201cThey\u2019ll eat their words, every one of them. They will receive you as their crown princess if they value their\u2014\u201d\n\u201cNo, being a hostage is perfect.\u201d \nArnold stared at her. \u201cHm?\u201d\n\u201cAs a hostage, I\u2019ll have no official duties, will I? We can pretend I\u2019m here only under great duress, and there will be no need for my comment on governmental or diplomatic affairs.\u201d\nArnold hesitated. \u201cI suppose not.\u201d\n\u201cExcellent! Then I can live my dream of being utterly useless.\u201d Rishe trembled with delight. The thought of acting as an ambassador had really been weighing on her mind. Being a princess was nonstop work. Having been groomed for the position from an early age, Rishe knew members of the royal family barely even had time to sleep.\nBut prisoners didn\u2019t have places in government.\n\u201cThis is such a weight off my mind,\u201d Rishe admitted. \u201cThank you so much for keeping your promise, Your Highness.\u201d\n\u201cEr, of course.\u201d\n\u201cBut don\u2019t worry, I won\u2019t shirk my duties as wedding planner.\u201d Nearly ready to collapse with relief, Rishe returned to her herbs.\n \n***\n \nAfter the bandit incident, Rishe felt the knights begin to ease a bit in her presence.\nDespite their initial reluctance to accept her help, they continued to report the injured men\u2019s progress and bring any concerns directly to her. In return, they took over gathering herbs from the surrounding countryside on their rest stops.\nShe hadn\u2019t done it for gratitude, but she was nonetheless touched. Gathering medicinal herbs had been second nature ever since her life as an apothecary, and it was foolish to ever turn down loyalty.\nSeveral days after the altercation with the bandits, the coach train finally arrived in the imperial capital of Galkhein.\n\u201cOh my,\u201d Rishe murmured as they passed through the gates.\nWhite stone buildings stood in straight rows, lining clean, orderly streets. The first stories all appeared to be shops, while the second-floor windows were festooned with flowers. Everywhere she looked were smiling faces, citizens turned out to witness their prince\u2019s return over the smooth brick roads. Overlooking it all was the towering magnificence of the imperial palace.\n\u201cThe capital is the seat of power in Galkhein,\u201d Arnold explained. \u201cSeveral key trade routes converge here.\u201d\nRishe nodded, suddenly anxious to be out of the coach. More and more people were gathering to watch their progress, some carrying shopping bags in both arms or holding hands with children. Many of them waved, as if greeting someone dear to them.\nHappy citizens and clean, orderly streets meant wealth. Galkhein was well-off. Rishe couldn\u2019t help but grin at an adorable little girl watching them roll by with sparkling eyes. When she saw Rishe\u2019s smile, she blushed and leapt up in the air, laughing with delight.\nThe coach made its way through the city before passing through the castle gates. Lines of disciplined knights flanked the road, ready to greet the crown prince and his fianc\u00e9e.\nArnold stepped out of the coach, holding out his hand to Rishe. She took it reflexively as she alighted. A prince would be expected to help any lady out of carriage, never mind his own consort, yet for some reason the knights looked a bit disturbed.\nRishe shot them back of look of innocent confusion.\n\u201cOur long journey is at last at its end, Your Highness, Lady Rishe.\u201d Oliver emerged from the ranks of the knights, bowing. He shot Arnold a curious glance. \u201cHow novel to see you taking the hand of your fianc\u00e9e.\u201d\nAh! Rishe realized that she herself had willingly broken the condition that she had imposed. Arnold had offered his hand, but she was the one who accepted.\nArnold gave a little laugh of triumph. Rishe felt a rush of frustration at being tricked. \nOliver stared at them before leaning in to whisper in Arnold\u2019s ear. Arnold let out a breath of annoyance. \n\u201cIs something the matter?\u201d Rishe asked.\n\u201cI sent orders ahead to have a detached wing of the palace prepared for us, but it seems the preparations are behind schedule. I\u2019m sorry, but you\u2019ll need to stay in a guest room in the main palace for a few days.\u201d\n\u201cOh, I don\u2019t mind if the wing isn\u2019t ready,\u201d Rishe said. \u201cWe can head over there now.\u201d\n\u201cIt hasn\u2019t been used in quite a while. It\u2019ll be covered in dust.\u201d\n\u201cI said that I didn\u2019t mind if it was a mess, remember? But there\u2019s no need for you to put yourself out. By all means, stay in the main palace for as long as you need.\u201d Rishe had spent a life as a maid\u2014dust didn\u2019t scare her. \u201cBesides, I\u2019m a hostage, after all.\u201d\n\u201cYou could at least attempt to sound distressed,\u201d Arnold said with the slightest trace of petulance. \nRishe, who had a huge grin spreading over her face and her chest puffed out with pride, didn\u2019t respond.\n \n***\n \nThe detached wing turned out to be just a separate palace in the distant corner of the grounds\u2014a scant four stories tall and, as advertised, absolutely swimming in dust.\nNot so bad, though. Rishe had pictured decay and clutter, but it was mostly just bare. Bare and musty, but not rotten or falling apart.\n\u201cYou can do whatever you want with this place. I\u2019ll be occupied over the next few days, but feel free to use the guest apartments in the main palace if you get tired of choking to death,\u201d Arnold said before he left.\nAccording to Oliver, work had piled up while the prince was away, and it wasn\u2019t just a few things that could be dispensed with over a few days working around the clock.\nEmperor Arnold Hein\u2026 He\u2019s just a crown prince right now, but I still wish I knew what\u2019s going on in his head. For now, I\u2019ll just focus on what I can do. Like make this place livable.\nShe changed into her plainest dress and rolled up her sleeves. The knights who\u2019d remained to serve as her guard kept watch over her as she went from window to window, throwing them all open.\nIn a stroke of luck, the weather was good, and the detached wing was well placed to soak up the sun. The lack of any creature comforts made it look ascetic and drab, but once it was furnished, Rishe had no doubt it would be lovely.\nLeaving the top floors to air out, Rishe found the stairs to the basement. She pushed the heavy wooden doors open, and mice skittered over her feet. The knights yelped as Rishe descended into the darkness.\n\u201cL-Lady Rishe, why are you going down here?\u201d\n\u201cCleaning supplies are usually kept in the basement. See?\u201d\nThe knights followed her gaze to a duster, broom, dustpan, and pile of fresh cloths. She filled a bucket with water and went to work, rolling up a handkerchief to cover her mouth as she swept dust down from high on the walls. Then she swept up all the dust on the floor.\nIt\u2019s always satisfying to tackle a place this filthy.\nShe corralled the dust bunnies until they were piled up like snow in the center of the hall, and then she swept them out the open door. Once the floors were free of debris, she attacked them with the cloth.\n\u201cLady Rishe, is there anything we can do to help?\nRishe was grateful for the knight\u2019s offer, but she shook her head. \u201cYour job is to guard me, not do my housekeeping.\u201d\n\u201cThis is quite the place to clean on your own, detached though it may be,\u201d the knight said hesitantly. \u201cIt\u2019s not too late to move into the guest chambers instead.\u201d\n\u201cThat\u2019s all right. I like the place already.\u201d\nRishe remained steadfast in her refusal for one reason: readying guest chambers was an awful chore. The palace maids would be expected to work overnight to prepare them, even if the guests were only staying a single night. No speck of dust or strand of hair could remain. Certainly no wrinkled sheets. Rishe knew how exhausting and rigorous a maid\u2019s job was, how nerve-racking.\nShe refused to put the poor dears through such an ordeal for just a few days\u2019 stay. From the sound of things, the palace wasn\u2019t equipped with many housemaids. No doubt they already had their hands full.\n\u201cBesides, take a look.\u201d She held out her arms wide, gesturing to her sparkling clean floor. The knights stared at the bright room in admiration. \u201cCleaning a place with your own hands makes living there that much more satisfying, you see.\u201d\nThe knights smiled their awkward but good-natured agreement.\nRishe worked tirelessly, and before long, the chambers where she would spend the night were ready. The knights offered to carry in the bed, which she allowed.\nWhile they brought in furniture, Rishe started cleaning another room. She had run out of clean water, so she quietly slipped out to the well without informing the knights. It wasn\u2019t quite fair to them, but these were the palace grounds. Surely she didn\u2019t need to be chaperoned everywhere.\nBesides, they\u2019re guards in name only. They\u2019re clearly just here to report my movements to Arnold Hein, Rishe reflected as she walked through a",
    "query_text": " courtyard full of flowers, bucket in hand. Iridescent butterflies cavorted playfully around her feet. He doesn\u2019t seem in a hurry to introduce me to the king. Although if I\u2019m just a hostage, that doesn\u2019t surprise me.\nShe hoped she got to meet the current emperor at least once. The future Arnold\u2019s violent conquest only began after he killed the man and made himself emperor, after all.\nI wonder what happened to Arnold Hein after I died in my past life. Did he reign supreme after winning his war? Or did some country manage to put a stop to his conquest? Whatever the case, I absolutely cannot allow him to start a conflict this time. Being the empress of a wartime nation sounds like so much work! The very thought is unacceptable!\nPerhaps they could divorce, but Rishe had a feeling that if Arnold decided to discard her in the middle of a war, she would fail in her"

A brush is more porous.\u201d\nThe young sons of the family Rishe served spent their time tumbling in the dirt, and she had plenty of experience scraping mud out of clothes. She could even salvage dirty socks that had spent days crumpled in the corner.\n\u201cDo you\u2026 Are you\u2026\u201d Elsie trailed off, blinking rapidly a couple of times before finally looking Rishe in the eyes. \u201cAre you the crown princess\u2019s maid?\u201d\nUnsure how to answer, Rishe couldn\u2019t meet her eyes.\n \n***\n \nAfter parting ways with Elsie, Rishe returned to the detached wing with her fresh water. She put clean sheets on the bed the knights had installed, satisfied that she had a comfortable place to sleep. This room also had the highest-up balcony in the whole detached palace.\nTaking a break, she wandered out onto the balcony and looked off over the capital, the golden afternoon tinged with the onset of twilight. The day was fresh with a recent rain, the air clear enough to see for miles. The spring breeze felt good against her skin, sweaty from cleaning. Rishe leaned against the railing, leaning her head back and closing her eyes.\nShe felt like collapsing into bed immediately, but she desperately needed a wash. Still, she didn\u2019t want to pull herself away from the view and the breeze just yet. When she resumed gazing out absentmindedly, something her mother once said drifted back to her. \n\u201cRishe, there is no need for you to think for yourself.\u201d\nShe frowned, the memories coming thick and fast now.\n\u201cYou mustn\u2019t forget that the duty of our family is to live our lives fully devoted to the kings of the land. You\u2019re smart, but all the thinking in the world won\u2019t do a woman any good. You need only concern yourself with how best to serve the crown prince.\u201d\n\u201cStudies? Focus on social etiquette\u2014that\u2019s what you need for navigating high society. The crown prince\u2019s bride must be flawless. Your smile is lacking. You must always strive to appear amiable.\u201d\nRishe breathed out a long sigh. When I was fifteen, their lectures were the only thing I thought about.\nHer parents preached constantly. \u201cA woman\u2019s true happiness is to marry a suitable man and give birth to his heirs.\u201d\n\u201cBut, Mother\u2026\u201d\nObjection was not permitted. Any argument was immediately dispensed with. As a woman, Rishe could not inherit her father\u2019s title. Her only value was in her marriage. \nDespite knowing now that the opinions of others were as worthless as empty titles, the words still echoed in her memories.\nRishe\u2019s fingertips twitched, and she opened her eyes. Unmoving, she said, \u201cShouldn\u2019t you be seeing to your duties?\u201d\n\u201cMore hidden depths, I see,\u201d came a voice tinged with pleasure. Rishe straightened and turned. There was Arnold, leaning against the door to the balcony. \u201cYou seem able to sense my approach no matter how far or how hard I try.\u201d\n\u201cYou\u2019re quite naughty, aren\u2019t you? You\u2019ve been making your presence known little by little, emanating threat, to see how quickly I catch on.\u201d\n\u201cSo you noticed that as well.\u201d Arnold joined Rishe on the balcony. She tensed, but all he did was cast a curious glance at the view. \u201cWhat were you looking at?\u201d\n\u201cThe city.\u201d Rishe was hardly going to tell him she\u2019d been looking at nothing, merely ruminating on her mother\u2019s overbearing advice. The view from the balcony was spectacular, though. \u201cWhat\u2019s that over there?\u201d\n\u201cYou mean the library? The state invested funds to expand it. We have books from all over the world.\u201d\n\u201cReally? You have a library that big?\u201d Rishe\u2019s eyes sparkled with delight. She pointed out another building. \u201cWhat about that spire? It\u2019s beautiful.\u201d\n\u201cThe church and clock tower. The bells ring out the hour.\u201d\n\u201cOoh, how wonderful! And it looks like there\u2019s a rather big market there too?\u201d\n\u201cYes, the largest market in the city. Carts line up in the early morning. Most of the offerings are made fresh every day.\u201d\n\u201cAmazing! And what about that pretty mountain over there?\u201d\nRishe tried and failed to contain her excitement. She couldn\u2019t help but imagine what seeing all these places up close would be like. The grand library, the beautiful church that told the time, and the morning market with fresh, delicious food\u2014she wanted to experience it all.\nSeeing Arnold\u2019s bemused face, she said, \u201cWhat?\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m just wondering where all this interest is coming from,\u201d he said. \u201cYou were so reluctant to come, yet here you are, brimming with curiosity for my city.\u201d\n\u201cWell\u2026\u201d she trailed off, unsure of how to respond.\nWhat should I say? Should I just tell him the truth?\nThis wasn\u2019t a secret, but talking about her hopes and dreams to the man who had killed her was a little awkward. A strange self-consciousness settled on her, her cheeks heating as she mumbled, \u201cBecause I\u2019ve always wanted to.\u201d\nArnold looked at her keenly. \u201c",
    "query_text": "Wanted to what?\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019ve always wanted to come here.\u201d\nDuring her life as a merchant, Rishe developed her single dream to visit everywhere in the world.

Every time, without fail, just as she found her footing, the world was plunged into chaos. She never had the chance to see Galkhein. This betrothal was her chance. \u201cIt\u2019s probably why I agreed to marry you,\u201d she added after a moment\u2019s hesitation.\nArnold"

Occasionally, habits from her other lives slipped through, but Arnold appeared to be the only one who noticed.\nNow he was looking at her with satisfaction. \u201cLady Rishe has only just arrived, and her acquaintances are few and far between. I hope I can count on you all to hold me accountable should I prove an incompetent husband.\u201d\n\u201cB-but of course, Your Highness.\u201d\n\u201cCome, Rishe.\u201d Arnold guided her out of the ring of spectators. The stares continued to follow them as they walked away.\nRishe dropped her voice to a whisper. \u201cYou sure know how to invite the ire of women.\u201d\n\u201cWhatever do you mean?\u201d\n\u201cThe way you harped on about me. Everything you said was tailor-made to stoke their jealousy. You\u2019ve gained me enemies, so thanks for that.\u201d\nArnold snorted. \u201cEverything I said was to protect you from enemies. They need to know you aren\u2019t just some trophy they can eliminate without recourse. We need to show them this to forestall any potential moves against you in the future.\n\u201cShow them what, exactly?\u201d\n\u201cThat I\u2019ll protect you no matter what.\u201d\nHe said it with such nonchalance that it brought her up short. Protect me? Arnold Hein, protect me?\nSuch an ironic position to take. She couldn\u2019t tell him that, of course. Her response came out somewhat strangled. \u201cI doubt they\u2019ll be anything to worry about. In fact, the biggest threat facing me is you.\u201d\n\u201cOh? And why do you say that?\u201d\n\u201cFor many reasons, the most obvious being that I\u2019m no match for you with a blade.\u201d As much as it pained her to admit it.\nArnold looked pleased. \u201cPerhaps we should duel.\u201d\n\u201cYes, please! And if it wouldn\u2019t be an intrusion\u2014I would like to train with you.\u201d If she studied him, she could learn his strategies and his attack patterns. She\u2019d never be a match in speed or raw power, but any insight would be invaluable.\n\u201cSure.\u201d Arnold shrugged. \u201cI don\u2019t mind.\u201d\n\u201cTruly?\u201d Her eyes glittered with anticipation.\nHe chuckled. \u201cYour answers never disappoint me.\u201d\n\u201cWhat\u2019s that supposed to mean? Oh, it looks like they\u2019re playing a new song.\u201d\nA soft melody drifted across the hall. The crowd divided, heading toward the center of the floor or against the wall. The next dance was starting, and everyone was waiting to see what the crown prince and his new fianc\u00e9e would do.\n\u201cWe don\u2019t have to dance if you don\u2019t want to,\u201d Arnold said.\n\u201cOh? As it happens, I like dancing.\u201d Plus, she couldn\u2019t resist a blatant challenge. She offered him her hand.\n\u201cVery well, then.\u201d Arnold only hesitated for a moment before taking it and steering her gently to an empty spot on the floor. He didn\u2019t seem like the dancing type, but his movements were slick and effortless. Facing one another, they joined hands. Arnold wrapped his other arm around her waist. \nOoh. His hand felt huge against her back. She realized she was breathing a little faster. They\u2019d never been this close before.\nNo, that isn\u2019t quite true. This is the second time. Rishe\u2019s final memories from her last life flashed vividly through her mind.\nThis was indeed the second time they had been this close\u2014the first had ended with a sword through her chest.\nEmperor Arnold Hein had single-handedly decimated the knights in the castle. Rishe stood in the midst of the carnage, breath ragged as she gripped the hilt of her sword, slick with her own blood. She was the last line of defense. The chamber behind her housed the royal family.\nIf they could reach the hidden passageways, the young prince and his party could find shelter with their allies across the border. Rishe and the other knights were prepared to sacrifice their lives to allow the royal family to survive. Their escape meant victory.\nBells tolled out, urging flight. All is lost. Run. Rishe managed to graze Arnold\u2019s cheek with her blade before she looked down to find his jet-black sword blooming out of her chest.\nShe remembered how it burned, as if the blade was made of fire. It was heat, not pain, but her breathing grew labored, and when Emperor Arnold Hein withdrew his sword, Rishe crumpled. \nHe knelt by her side and whispered something.\nThe words were seared into her memory. Rishe squeezed Arnold\u2019s hand as they danced.\nI\u2019ll be the bully this time. \nRishe shifted her weight back, slipping out of the hold on her waist. She broke Arnold\u2019s lead and spun, drifting on the harmony of the dance. She took him by surprise; his eyes went wide.\nI wonder what you\u2019ll do when you\u2019re no longer on top, Your Highness. Her smile was a declaration of war. Watching him attempt to follow her lead would be delightful. She pulled his hand toward her, attempting to move them into a spin.\nBut Arnold held fast. He planted his hand on her waist and turned them in a different direction, using her inertia against her. Hey! As a result, Rishe twirled by herself on the spot.\nShe didn\u2019t miss a step. She turned elegantly, the hem of her dress whispering across the ballroom floor. She heard appreciative murmurs from the wallflowers lined up watching.\nDespite that, Rishe took it as a defeat. Round one to Arnold. \nSo\u2026you can think on your feet. How about this?\nArnold remained unruffled, evading her next scheme like it was nothing. He grinned down at her, his eyes shining with a dare.\nHe thinks I can\u2019t beat him. His ease vexed her, but it was his smugness that made her angry.\nShe let out a hard breath, attempting a maneuver to lure him in while turning. He leaned back, not falling for it at all.\nHe\u2019s just too good at changing his center of gravity! She kept her astonishment under wraps, but she felt it. Despite how close we\u2019re dancing, I can\u2019t throw off his timing at all. He\u2019s sidestepped all my attempts, and he takes back the lead the second I let down my guard!\nIt made her increasingly angry. She twirled and stepped as the dance dictated, all the while feeling out for moments of weakness. Arnold played along with her game, completely unruffled.\nEvery single time. I\u2019m doing my utmost to trip him up, but he doesn\u2019t even seem annoyed! At this point she\u2019d just settle for any reaction at all.\nTheir unusual dance style had gathered a crowd. Rishe paid them no mind, focused only on her goal. Then something occurred to her, and her breath caught in her throat.\nWait a minute, he has left an opening. It\u2019s the same one from before. She thought back to their fight to the death, to that moment when she had managed to draw blood. That may indeed have been his only weakness.\nIf I strike the same way\u2014huh? Before she could try, Arnold appeared to lose patience, wrapping his arm around her waist. He bent her back into a dip so deep it felt like he\u2019d pulled a carpet from under her feet. She yelped, grabbing at him reflexively, clinging tight. His big hands gripped her securely enough to mitigate the sensation of falling. Relief flooded through her, and she felt a laugh rumble against her ear.\nThe music came to an end with one last ringing note. She blinked. The dance is over?\nA hush fell over the ballroom. Then cheers broke out, followed by a round of applause.\n\u201cThat was incredible!\u201d\nThe watching nobles crowded in.\n\u201cYou two moved in such perfect harmony!\u201d\n\u201cI was on the edge of my seat. I felt like I was watching a sword duel!\u201d\n\u201cIs this a dance from Hermity? I\u2019ve never seen such steps before.\u201d\n\u201cUh, well\u2026\u201d Rishe floundered. She glanced up at Arnold, who appeared to be enjoying her struggle. She\u2019d get no help from him.\nRishe dealt with the barrage of questions as best she could, letting the crowd sweep them into the dining room, which was set up for a buffet-style meal. She made sure to greet every guest, riveting their faces into her memory.\nShe must have been acting peculiar, because Arnold eventually said, \u201cRishe, I think the wine is getting to you. Shall we get some fresh air?\u201d\nRishe hadn\u2019t touched a single drop. In fact, she\u2019d been caught up in so many conversations that she hadn\u2019t even had the chance to eat, but she had experience working on an empty stomach. She accepted Arnold\u2019s encouragement as the escape it was.\nJust when I least expect it, he\u2019ll act the gentleman. Maybe he\u2019d remembered her demand for a carefree life of doing nothing.\nRishe cast a charming look across the crowd. \u201cThank you for your consideration, Your Highness. Forgive me.\u201d She gave a polite bow before quietly slipping away. \nShe didn\u2019t head straight to the balcony but rather slowly walked around the hall. There was only so much she could find out glued to Arnold\u2019s side all night.\nI need information. Galkhein\u2019s political landscape was a mystery to me through all my past lives. I only know the rumors that made it abroad.\nAlthough she knew of Arnold\u2019s eventual patricide, she had no concept of the circumstances leading up to it. She needed a better picture of the factions and power balance inside the court. The lives these people led.\nI know better than to believe wartime gossip. This Arnold Hein is a lot different from what I\u2019d heard he was like at nineteen. He\u2019s not as diabolical as the rumors led me to believe. He likes to push, but he isn\u2019t unkind. The thought drifted across her mind, leaving her conflicted. Well, he\u2019s not unkind now. But I still don\u2019t like not knowing his motives. And he\u2019s a bit of a jerk, to be honest. \nShe tried to settle her mind and just observe. Gathering intelligence was necessary to lead a long, carefree life lazing around the palace.\nIf I recall correctly, that\u2019s Lord Hannawald. He seems to be on good terms with Count Gayle. Duke Hudemann and Duke Teinitz are having a friendly enough conversation, yet they don\u2019t seem close. Rishe ticked off the names of people she\u2019d met, committing them to memory.\nA wave of sweet perfume wafted over her. A pretty girl with soft blonde hair had appeared at her side. \u201cHow do you do, Lady Rishe? I\u2019m Cornelia Thea Toona.\u201d\nDuke Toona\u2019s family was the thirty-first house she\u2019d met tonight.\nRishe smiled graciously. \u201cRishe Irmgard Weitzner. A pleasure to meet you.\u201d\n\u201cThe pleasure is all mine.\u201d Cornelia smiled sweetly. Her eyes were big and bright, her lips full. She held a glass in each hand and offered one to Rishe. \u201cWine? I see you\u2019re empty-handed.\u201d\nA gaggle of other ladies nearby began giggling among themselves.\n\u201cHow dare she act so haughty when she\u2019s a captive. It\u2019s time for her learn just what she is. A pawn to be played and discarded.\u201d\n\u201cShe should enjoy her time on Prince Arnold\u2019s arm while she can.\u201d\n\u201cShe is from a minor nation, after all.\u201d\nAs Rishe took note of their whispers, Cornelia gazed at her with doe eyes. \u201cDoes my offering offend you in some way?\u201d\nIf I remember correctly, House Toona holds a vast territory in southern Galkhein.\nRishe held out a hand to accept the glass. \u201cHow could it? Thank you, Lady Cornelia.\u201d\nBefore Rishe could touch the glass, Cornelia gave a dramatic shout. \u201cOh dear! My hand slipped!\u201d She dropped it, quite obviously on purpose. Without thinking, Rishe grabbed her skirts and leaned back, plucking the glass out of the air with the other hand.\nCornelia let out a cry of surprise as Rishe caught the wine before any could spill. She swirled the glass and brought it to her nose to breathe in the bouquet.\nHmm\u2026 That\u2019s mashed capsicum. Where did she even get that? What a waste of perfectly good wine. And why bother spicing it enough to singe the tongue if she just planned to ruin my dress? Pick a plan, my dear.\nHiding her exasperation, Rishe smiled brightly. \u201cI\u2019ve never had a wine quite like this. What an unusual scent.\u201d\nCornelia bit her lip in frustration. Rishe beamed at her. You\u2019ve got such a pretty face, Lady Toona. Why don\u2019t you smile?\nRishe leaned in close to Cornelia. \u201cThis vintage isn\u2019t available where I\u2019m from. I\u2019m ever so anxious to learn more. Should I perhaps invite Prince Arnold over to enjoy a glass? Which tray did you get this from?\u201d\n\u201cWhat? Oh, um\u2026\u201d Rishe had a policy of never backing down from a fight, but it seemed Cornelia didn\u2019t share it. \u201cS-sorry, but I don\u2019t remember. Such a large hall, you see.\u201d\n\u201cA shame. I\u2019ll just give His Highness this one, then. I\u2019ll be sure to let him know who it\u2019s from.\u201d\n\u201cUh, wait!\u201d Cornelia rapidly shook her head. \u201cI-I got that glass for you, so I think you should\u2014you know what? Never mind! Maybe I should just take that\u2014oh no!\u201d\nRishe ignored the ashen-faced Cornelia, raising the glass and swallowing down a gulp. \n\u201cI-I can\u2019t believe\u2026\u201d\n\u201cSuch a spicy flavor, just as I imagined.\u201d Rishe smiled again to the assembled group\u2019s astonishment. \u201cWhat a warm welcome. I do hope the two of us can spend more time together. Perhaps\u2026a tea party?\u201d\n\u201cTh-the two of us?\u201d Cornelia stammered.\n\u201cYes. I want to know all about House Toona.\u201d\nCornelia looked flabbergasted, but she recovered herself and nodded.\nThat should do. One of Rishe\u2019s eventual plans required a plot of land in a temperate climate. House Toona\u2019s would likely be perfect, but she needed to confirm a few things with Cornelia. Never back down from a fight. Even further\u2026\nShe recalled the words of her mentor from her days as a merchant.\nDon\u2019t bother with fights you can\u2019t win.\nThe other ladies fled, fearful of this strange girl who gulped down painfully spicy wine like it was nothing. \n \n***\n \nRishe retreated to the empty balcony to enjoy the music, grimacing with every stinging mouthful of wine. She drank it in decreasing sips until Arnold joined her.\n\u201cWhat are you making that face for?\u201d\nRishe swirled the glass. \u201cDon\u2019t worry, it\u2019s not you. It\u2019s just this wine is so spicy.\u201d\n\u201cSpicy? The wine is?\u201d\n\u201cMm. It\u2019s seasoned with capsicum. I barely managed to get that first mouthful down without gagging.\u201d\nArnold swiped the glass from her hand. \u201cDon\u2019t tell me this was a poisoning attempt!\u201d\nRishe clicked her tongue in annoyance at her own lack of vigilance. No one else would be able to grab something from her so easily.\nArnold glared at the wine. \u201cYou don\u2019t need to drink this. I\u2019ll get rid of it.\u201d\n\u201cHey, give that back! They ruined a perfectly good glass of wine because of me. I\u2019m not going to waste it.\u201d She grabbed it back and took another sip, shuddering at the taste.\nArnold glowered. \u201cTell me who did this. I\u2019ll have them executed.\u201d\n\u201cDon\u2019t be ridiculous. You don\u2019t kill people like her\u2014you use them.\u201d Just the tiniest bit of wine to go, but it was getting harder to make herself drink it. She gave the glass a reproachful look, then glanced back at Arnold. \u201cOh, and I owe you an apology.\u201d\n\u201cDo you?\u201d\n\u201cI used your name to defend myself.\u201d The girls had only backed off when she threatened to tattle to Arnold. Rishe found that sort of thing inelegant in the extreme, and she was embarrassed.\nArnold sighed at Rishe\u2019s apologetic bow. \u201cThere\u2019s nothing wrong with a wife invoking her husband\u2019s name.\u201d\nRishe hesitated. \u201cWe\u2019re not married yet.\u201d\n\u201cThat\u2019s a formality. It\u2019s as good as done, if you ask me.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2026see.\u201d\nHe took her distraction as an opportunity to swipe her glass back. Instead of dumping it out, Arnold gulped the rest of it down. \n\u201cDamn, that packs a punch,\u201d he grumbled.\n\u201cI told you that!\u201d Rishe snapped. \u201cAre you all right? Let me get you some water!\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m fine. But now you\u2019ve fulfilled your obligation to the wine, haven\u2019t you?\u201d\nRishe didn\u2019t know what to say. He\u2019d helped her\u2014not by taking charge but by following her lead. Without cutting her down and telling her she was being foolish. Without rolling his eyes and dismissing her desires as trifles.\n\u201cThank you,\u201d Rishe said stiffly, which just made him laugh.\n\u201cWhat were you thinking about when we were dancing?\u201d he asked.\n\u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d\n\u201cYou were thinking about someone else, weren\u2019t you? Who?\u201d\nRishe didn\u2019t know a delicate way to say I was thinking about a future version of you I met in another life.\n\u201cHmm?\u201d His tone was oddly light, teasing even. But the gleam in his hunter\u2019s eyes said she wouldn\u2019t get away so easily.\nObviously, Rishe couldn\u2019t give him an honest answer. \u201cI wasn\u2019t thinking about anyone else. I was worried about you.\u201d\n\u201cWhy?\u201d\nThis was the closest she could come to the truth. \u201cWere you injured here?\u201d She patted her own left shoulder with her forefinger. \nArnold went silent. His left shoulder was slightly slower to react than his right\u2014if his right",
    "query_text": " was at one hundred, then his left was at maybe ninety-eight. It was hardly noticeable, but Rishe had picked up on it. He was right-handed, and she wouldn\u2019t have noticed it if they\u2019d been dancing normally. \nThat, and if it hadn\u2019t been for memories from her past life.\nRishe had only managed to inflict a single injury on him. An instant, a moment\u2019s hesitation where she saw her chance and slashed left. Of course, he\u2019d shrugged off the injury and effortlessly run"

    "prefix_text": "YOU\u2019RE ALL SO USELESS!\u201d Diana the redheaded maid\u2019s voice rang out inside the stone washhouse. \nThree days had passed since the afternoon Rishe shook off her guard and came out to the well. Rishe was once again dressed to fit in with the maids. At Diana\u2019s shout, she looked up without pausing in her work. \n\u201cIs even laundry beyond your capabilities? I asked you to wash these this morning, and now it\u2019s past noon! Meanwhile, we\u2019ve finished cleaning the entire first floor in a third of the time!\u201d\n\u201cI-I\u2019m sorry, Diana.\u201d\nThe new maids went silent with shame. Among them was Elsie, the girl Rishe stood up for the other day. Rishe pulled her hands out of the soapy water, gently rinsed them, and said, \u201cLet me help. What still needs to be done?\u201d\n\u201cYou again?\u201d Diana rounded on Rishe. \u201cI don\u2019t know who you serve, but I\u2019m amazed you have the time to do other people\u2019s work. I wish I had so much free time.\u201d\nHuffily, she turned from Rishe. \u201cLet\u2019s just ignore these useless fools. Laura, Maya. Come on. If we want to be chosen as Lady Rishe\u2019s maids, we mustn\u2019t waste our time.\u201d\nDiana took out a slip of paper from her pocket, smoothing it out. \u201cIt looks like the new bedsheets for her palace will arrive today. We should inspect them to make sure everything is perfect!\u201d\n\u201cWait up, Diana!\u201d\nThe two maids followed Diana out. Rishe waited for the door to close before turning to Elsie and the others. \u201cLet\u2019s keep working. If there\u2019s anything too large and cumbersome, feel free to pass it over to me.\u201d\n\u201cTh-thank you so much!\u201d The new maids went weak with gratitude. One of them, a girl on the verge of tears, even fell into a full bow. Rishe muttered encouragement as she scrubbed some bedsheets.\nElsie, who was washing the sheets with her, wore a rueful look. \u201cI\u2019m so sorry for the trouble. We\u2019re just not learning fast enough.\u201d\n\u201cYou haven\u2019t been working here long, have you? It takes time to learn a new job, no matter who you are,\u201d Rishe said as she kept scrubbing. \u201cAnd it\u2019s not like you\u2019ve never washed a single thing in your life before, right?\u201d\nElsie nodded nervously. \nRishe had realized over the past few days doing the laundry that not all the newcomers were complete amateurs. They\u2019d obviously done chores at home, or something similar. When set a specific task, they could perform it properly, but Diana\u2019s complaints weren\u2019t unfounded. They did take far too much time with laundry.\nBut it\u2019s obvious why. \u201cDo you know anything about Diana?\u201d Rishe asked Elsie. \u201cLike, is she from a well-off family?\u201d\nElsie said, \u201cI heard that her father was a business owner. She worked with him.\u201d\n\u201cI heard that as well,\u201d added another maid. \u201cBut he fell into debt and had to sell off.\u201d \nRishe stopped scrubbing for a moment to consider this.\n\u201cUm, is something the matter?\u201d Elsie asked.\nRishe smiled and shook her head. \u201cNo, nothing. Let\u2019s just focus on getting these washed for the time being.\u201d\n \n***\n \nThat afternoon, thirty maids were assembled in the detached wing of the palace. Ten of them were old hands, long in service to the royal family, while the other twenty were freshly hired. The crown princess was to choose her maids from among these thirty. They wore their nerves plainly on their sleeves. \n\u201cHey, I thought this palace was in a terrible state of neglect,\u201d one maid whispered. \u201cWhy is it so sparkling clean?\u201d\n\u201cYeah, you\u2019re right,\u201d said another. \u201cSomeone must have sorted it out before we arrived.\u201d\n\u201cI wonder what kind of person Lady Rishe is. Ooh, I\u2019m so nervous.\u201d\nThe girls looked around anxiously.\n\u201cHey, Elsie, that girl who was always helping us isn\u2019t here.\u201d\nElsie blinked. \u201cYou\u2019re right.\u201d\n\u201cLook, Diana. That impertinent newbie didn\u2019t get picked.\u201d \nAt her friend\u2019s observation, Diana preened with satisfaction. \u201cNo surprise there. You need some manners to attend to Lady Rishe. I bet she got kicked out of the running!\u201d Her eyes sparkled with confidence.\nAt last, there was a knock at the door.\n\u201cHer Royal Highness, Princess Rishe.\u201d\nThe maids quickly fell into bows. Diana\u2019s chest ached with anticipation as heels clicked on the floor, approaching the line of girls. From the corner of their eyes, the maids saw a wide-skirted court dress. A gentle scent washed over them.\nWithout even looking at her, they could tell Crown Princess Rishe was a lovely woman. Diana and her friends swelled with pride that she was to become their mistress.\nBut then Laura whispered to Diana, \u201cHey, isn\u2019t this scent familiar?\u201d\n\u201cQuiet!\u201d Clearly it was some sort of expensive perfume. Or so Diana thought, but then she realized what it was. The words just slipped out. \u201cIt\u2019s soap.\u201d\n\u201cHuh? Did you just say something?\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s soap. The same kind we always use.\u201d Diana was sure of it.\nThe princess said, \u201cPlease rise.\u201d \nWhy did her voice sound so familiar? An incredible foreboding gripping her, Diana looked up. She gasped.\n\u201cMy name is Rishe Irmgard Weitzner.\u201d\nBefore her stood the beautiful newcomer\u2014the thorn in her side for the past few days. The smile she wore was peaceful and just the slightest bit satisfied.\n \n***\n \nI\u2019m so glad I managed to finish washing the sheets in time!\nStanding before the maids with Arnold\u2019s attendant Oliver at her side, Rishe was panicking on the inside. She\u2019d had so much to do this morning that she\u2019d put off the laundry to the last minute. She took deep, controlled breaths, praying no one would notice that she\u2019d raced here at a dead sprint.\nOliver was none the wiser as he spoke to the assembled girls. Rishe took the opportunity to look them over. She locked eyes with Elsie, who was gaping at her. It was a nice change\u2014usually her face was as blank as a rock wall.\nI\u2019m sorry for the deception. I figured blending in would give me the best picture of your working conditions.\nThe new maids wore similarly shocked expressions, while others watched her with delight. Meanwhile, the veterans, including Diana, had all gone pale. They trembled, stunned into silence. One seemed locked in a terrifying trance, while another looked on the verge of tears. All of them had spoken to Rishe with derision. As the ringleader, Diana was covering her mouth with both hands, like she was holding in a scream.\nOliver had finished his introduction. \u201cYour Highness, if you would?\u201d\nRishe stepped forward. \u201cFirst, I must apologize to you for what has transpired prior to this meeting. My deception, that is. However, it has granted me insight into how each one of you works.\u201d\nOliver\u2019s face creased in confusion. The newcomer maids began to panic, whispering among themselves.\n\u201cDoesn\u2019t this mean that she helped us out with the laundry?\u201d\n\u201cWe\u2019re going to be fired!\u201d\n\u201cIf I lose my position, my brother will have to quit school!\u201d\nNoticing the commotion, Oliver glanced at Rishe. \u201cYour Highness, two-thirds of these maids are newly recruited from the city. Since the majority of the castle maids were elderly, His Highness assumed you would prefer maids closer in age to yourself.\u201d\nRishe was startled. She had found it odd that most of her potential servants were new hires, but she hadn\u2019t expected this to be the reason.\n\u201cWhile the prince has entrusted the selection of your maids to you,\u201d Oliver went on. \u201cHiring someone with no experience will not do. Despite Prince Arnold\u2019s views, I urge you to reject the newcomers.\u201d\n\u201cOliver.\u201d\n\u201cI have a list of their names here. Elsie\u2014\u201d\n\u201cElsie, Nichole, Hilde, Marguerite, Rosa.\u201d Rishe began listing the names of the newly recruited maids. She\u2019d made a point to memorize them in the washhouse. \u201cElke, Amelia, and\u2014\u201d\nOliver looked at her wildly. \u201cYou know them all?! Even though they\u2019ve never served you in the past?\u201d\n\u201cYes, of course I do. Servants are essential to the maintenance of our lifestyle, why wouldn\u2019t I get to know them?\u201d Rishe listed the remaining names for good measure. \u201cAll twenty of you, listen to me.\u201d \nThe new maids stiffened. Diana and the other maids whose names hadn\u2019t been called were getting their wind back, wearing increasingly triumphant looks.\nRishe said, \u201cThe twenty names I just called will be my maids.\u201d\nTime seemed to stand still a moment, and then Oliver broke in with an astonished, \u201cB-but, my lady! They are all inexperienced\u2014\u201d\n\u201cYes. And my palace will be the perfect place to learn.\u201d\nThe new recruits were completely speechless, unsure of exactly what was happening. \nRishe smiled at Elsie. \u201cI hope you\u2019ll serve me well, Elsie.\u201d\nElsie was still frozen in place. \u201cHuh? Y-yes, my lady, but\u2014\u201d\nA shaking Diana cried out, \u201cBut why, my lady?! You\u2019ve seen their work! They\u2019re useless, the lot of them! The rest of us get so much more done in a shorter amount of time!\u201d\n\u201cWatch your tongue, girl,\u201d Oliver said sharply.\nDiana ignored him. \u201cWe\u2019re hard workers! Any job you assign us, we can do it! Please, I beg you, my lady!\u201d\n\u201cStep back,\u201d Oliver warned. \u201cDo not take a single step closer to Lady Rishe.\u201d\nDiana spoke in a rush, words pouring out of her. \u201cI-I freely admit that I was impolite before, but I didn\u2019t know who she was! I\u2019ll take any punishment, so please, give me the chance to show you how well I can work!\u201d\nRishe said, \u201cDiana, I have a request.\u201d\n\u201cTh-thank you, my lady!\u201d Diana heaved a sigh of relief. \u201cYou mean you\u2019ll\u2014\u201d \nRishe cut across her. \u201cAs of today, you are no longer a maid in this palace.\u201d \n\u201cWhat?\u201d Her face, usually so fixed with determination, paled. \u201cBut why? I\u2019m so much better than any of them! I\u2019ll do a perfect job no matter what task you set before me. Please don\u2019t dismiss me, my lady!\u201d \n\u201cListen to me, Diana.\u201d Rishe dropped her lofty tone, speaking as one woman would to another. \u201cYou have noticed it, haven\u2019t you? No matter what you claim, these new girls aren\u2019t worthless.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2026I don\u2019t understand.\u201d\n\u201cCan you remember your first month in service? How difficult it was?\u201d\nDiana looked completely bewildered. Her gaze darted around as if looking for help.\nPulling herself together, she forced herself to follow Rishe\u2019s directions. She thought back and finally alighted on a response. \u201cI\u2026I didn\u2019t know how to do the job. Before, when my family was still prominent, I\u2019d washed shirts and bedsheets. Never gowns or military uniforms.\u201d\n\u201cPerfectly reasonable,\u201d Rishe said. \u201cOnly natural for someone just starting out.\u201d\n\u201cThe older girls were so busy, they told me to just watch them since they didn\u2019t have time to teach me. When I had questions\u2026well, there was nobody to ask.\u201d\n\u201cI bet. And did you have any other problems?\u201d\n\u201cWell, yes. There was a lot to learn. Different kinds of soap and washboards depending on the cloth. You use different tools for different materials. I had to learn how they worked and how to put them away. I was\u2026punished if I didn\u2019t get it right the first time.\u201d\nThe newcomers were exchanging surprised looks. Rishe understood why.\nEverything Diana said was familiar to them. They spent valuable time searching for their materials and the proper ways to use them, but they shrank from asking for help. Everyone always looked so busy. This was a universal problem.\n\u201cDespite all that, I got better!\u201d Diana protested. \u201cI only needed to be taught once. Unlike them! They\u2019re useless!\u201d\n\u201cYes, well. There\u2019s a difference between you and them,\u201d Rishe told Diana. \u201cYou can read and write.\u201d\n\u201cOh!\u201d Diana started in surprise. Elsie looked at the floor.\nThe literacy rate among commoners was low no matter where you went. Very few families had the means to afford an education, especially for daughters. Diana had been born to a merchant\u2019s family\u2014she\u2019d received formal schooling. The maids she was close friends with were likely from similar backgrounds. The majority of those in service were not so fortunate.\n\u201cWhat if you only received instructions on how to do a job once and weren\u2019t able to write it down to remind yourself later?\u201d Rishe asked. \u201cWould you be so confident?\u201d\n\u201cI-I don\u2019t\u2014\u201d Diana reflexively thrust a hand into her apron pocket, where she had a list of daily tasks recorded in her neat handwriting to reference throughout the day. Hopefully now she would understand how much of an edge her privileged literacy gave her over the other maids.\n\u201cEveryone else works as hard as they can, just like you do,\u201d Rishe said. \u201cRemember how it was for you at first? They all have to start somewhere. I hope you\u2019ll keep that in mind.\u201d\n\u201cThey\u2019re no different from me,\u201d Diana mumbled begrudgingly, glancing around the room, looking at the less experienced maids. As if coming to a decision, she said, \u201cI\u2019m sorry.\u201d\n\u201cDiana?\u201d\nLike a child enumerating her regrets, Diana went on, \u201cI\u2019ve done you wrong, all of you. It\u2019s just, I had nothing. Or so it felt like. No money, no title. I thought I had to make my way in the world on my own. That I had to start from zero.\u201d Her shoulders trembled as she buried her face in her hands. \u201cBut I was wrong! I wasn\u2019t starting from zero. I had everything that I learned growing up. I didn\u2019t realize how fortunate I was. I let it all go to my he\n \n\u201cRISHE IRMGARD WEITZNER! You are a vile woman! A truly malicious creature unworthy of the crown prince! As of this instant, our engagement is off!\u201d \n\u201cAs you wish, Your Highness.\u201d\n\u201c\u2026Huh?\u201d\nThe prince\u2019s declaration echoed throughout the ballroom. Rishe, the duke\u2019s daughter, bowed in response, her coral-toned hair swaying gracefully. The assembled guests found themselves captivated by her dignified beauty. Despite having just witnessed a broken engagement, they couldn\u2019t bring themselves to pity her.\nSlowly, Rishe lifted her head and fixed the prince with a pale-emerald gaze. It caught him off guard, but he quickly recovered.\n\u201cDidn\u2019t you hear what I just said?! I\u2019m calling off our engagement! Doesn\u2019t that trouble you?\u201d\n\u201cNot really.\u201d\nRishe already knew what happened next: false accusations, exile, and her family severing all ties and leaving her to survive on her own. She turned from the prince. There was no point wasting any time.\nThis is my seventh loop, after all.\nRishe had done this all before.\nThe next few hours will be busy. I must hurry and retrieve my things before I\u2019m barred from the family estate. I don\u2019t want this to be one of the times I\u2019m too slow and I have to start my new life with nothing.\n\u201cRishe, halt and hear me! I have spent the past week perfecting my recitation of your crimes!\u201d\nI should take more than dresses this time\u2014there\u2019s plenty of things I could use out in the world. What trade should I take up? In my first life, I was a merchant. In my second, an apothecary. I\u2019ve got a few more I want to try out\u2026 Augh! If time\u2019s just going to keep resetting, I wish I could start at an earlier point. I need more time to prepare!\n\u201cWait! Rishe!\u201d\nThe crown prince was on the verge of tears, and the spectators struggled to suppress their snickers. \nA thought occurred to Rishe, and she stopped. She then turned, her eyes gleaming beneath long lashes as she stared down her ex-fianc\u00e9. \u201cAh, Your Highness, I almost forgot.\u201d \n\u201cYes, tell me!\u201d the prince fumed. \u201cLet me guess, you are hurt beyond measure and yet love me still\u2026correct?\u201d\nAs if. Rishe was grateful to be granted her freedom. In fact, she was smiling as she said, \u201cI hope you and Lady Mary are happy together.\u201d\n\u201cWhat?!\u201d\n\u201cMay we both lead fulfilling lives. Farewell!\u201d Rishe lifted the skirts of her evening gown and turned on her heel, departing as briskly as she could.\n\u201cHow do you know about Mary? I haven\u2019t told you I love her!\u201d The prince was shouting something behind her, but she paid him no mind. She had things to do.\nDuring her first loop, the prince\u2019s accusations had shocked her to the core and she\u2014foolishly so\u2014had attempted to defend herself. Now she knew better than to expect the prince to behave reasonably. \nHow will life unfold this time? I\u2019m excited to find out! Rishe fixed her mind on the future.\nThis is my seventh \u201cdo-over.\u201d I\u2019ve led happy and carefree lives before, but this time\u2014this time, I swear I\u2019ll live a long happy and carefree life!\nIn other words, she needed to avoid getting killed. At any cost. \n \n***\n \nIn the first loop, with her engagement broken and her reputation in tatters, Rishe roamed with nothing but the clothes on jewelry. Finding them a good-natured band, she hitched a ride to a neighboring country.\nFrom the merchant caravan, she learned a trade, studying how to procure stock and balance ledgers. Eventually, she set out on her own to travel the world. Her upbringing as a daughter of the nobility meant that, even at fifteen years old, Rishe possessed a keen sense for beauty.\nShe collected things that caught her eye and sold them to whoever found delight in her w",

She had even done business with the king of a desert nation and the prince of a frozen country up north. She traveled to many distant places, realizing a dream born from her cossetted former life spent doing nothing but preparing to be queen.\nFive years passed, and just as she had only one country left to visit, Rishe fell victim to the war sweeping across the continent.\nThe next thing she knew, she was fifteen years old again and back at that party, with the prince poised to make his pronouncement.\n\u201cRishe Irmgard Weitzner! You are a vile woman! A truly malicious creature unworthy of the crown prince! As of this instant"

    "prefix_text": " for the balcony, where she ran into something at full speed.\n\u201cBwargh!\u201d Rishe let out a very unladylike grunt, staggering a few steps. She looked up to see what she\u2019d bounced off of. \u201cOh\u2026\u201d\nAn exceptionally handsome man stood in her path.\nHe had refined, patrician features and cruel, thin lips. He was slender yet powerful; even through his clothes, Rishe could tell his body was well conditioned. His jet-black hair covered his ears, creeping down to the nape of his neck. The tips of his locks bounced with his movements. They looked to be soft to the touch.\nFrom head to toe, he was a pleasure to look at\u2014but what held Rishe\u2019s attention were his eyes. They were long in shape and impossibly blue, but they possessed a blade-sharp intensity. His gaze was clear, beautiful, and cold as ice. His eyelashes cast shadows on his striking face. He was a work of art.\nCurrently, this work of art was staring her down with a look that could kill.\nHe laughed. \u201cYou barreled right into me. For a moment, I thought I\u2019d been attacked by a wild boar.\u201d\nIt was an exceedingly rude thing to say to a stranger, but as luck would have it, this man was not a stranger. At least not to Rishe.\n\u201cWhat are you even doing here?\u201d the man went on. \u201cThe party is in the\u2014\u201d\nRishe interrupted him with a wordless shout of dismay. The man drew back, reflexively reaching for his sword. He composed himself with visible difficulty. \u201cWho are you? You look like any noblewoman, but your manner is\u2026\u201d \n\u201cEmperor Arnold Hein!\u201d \nThe man\u2019s eyes widened. He didn\u2019t mistake her surging contempt. Rishe had crossed swords with this man. Recently. He was the one responsible for ending her sixth life. \nHe must be a guest at the banquet. It makes sense.\nArnold Hein was the scion of a military nation not far from Rishe\u2019s home country of Hermity, the one in which they now stood. Their kingdoms, so recently at war, had brokered an ostensible peace, and the two ruling families met from time to time. Crown Prince Dietrich\u2019s engagement party would be one such occasion. He\u2019d gathered elites from far and wide to introduce to his beloved Mary.\nThe man eyed Rishe with rising curiosity. \u201cYou know me? This is my first time in Hermity.\u201d\nUh-oh. Rishe pasted on a smile as her mind spun in circles. This man was dangerous. She had to avoid entanglements with him at all costs. Five years from now, Arnold Hein would invade Hermity. \nHe was an extraordinarily skilled swordsman and, with a powerful military at his back, was destined to conquer kingdom after kingdom. He had done as much in her second, third, fourth, and fifth lives. In her sixth, Rishe had faced him in battle herself and died by his hand.\nWe never had a chance. That war was lost before it began.\nArnold\u2019s brilliance lay not in his swordplay but in his skill as a tactician. He set countries up for conquest and knocked them down, swallowing them one by one.\nI know him, but he doesn\u2019t know me. We haven\u2019t met in this life. I need an excuse fast. \nRishe curtsied slowly. \u201cMy name is Rishe Irmgard Weitzner. We\u2019ve never been introduced, but I\u2019ve heard of you.\u201d\nArnold donned an amused smile. \u201cYou plant your weight like a trained swordswoman. Your center of gravity is perfect.\u201d\n\u201cYou exaggerate,\u201d Rishe demurred. \u201cThat was simply a curtsy to an esteemed guest.\u201d \n\u201cI must have misheard, but I swear you called me \u2018emperor\u2019 just now.\u201d \nRishe froze.\n\u201cMy father yet lives,\u201d Arnold said. \u201cI am simply a crown prince. Why would you call me that?\u201d \n\u201cUh, um\u2026\u201d Rishe floundered for an answer.\nShe\u2019d made such a foolish mistake. Arnold\u2019s gaze cut right through her. It felt like he\u2019d see through any lie she told right down to her soul. She remembered this from the battlefield\u2014how his attention alone felt like a sword thrust.\nBut why even bother to lie? They\u2019d never meet again, so who cared what he thought of her? Sure, she harbored a hard feeling or two over the recent slaying, but there was no point complaining about it to this Arnold. Calling him the emperor was boorish, but Rishe was in the process of being forcibly exiled. Why play at diplomacy?\nShe took a deep breath and bowed low. This was not the curtsy of a noble lady but of a servant bowing in supplication to her master.\n\u201cMy humblest apologies, Your Highness. I was in a rush. Such a rude slip of the tongue.\u201d She raised her head. \u201cMy ex-fianc\u00e9 just annulled our engagement, so I\u2019ve got a lot on my mind. If you would excuse me.\u201d \n\u201cHe annulled your engagement?\u201d\nAt that, Rishe turned and fled.\nThis unexpected run-in with Arnold had taken up valuable time. She threw open the door to the balcony and hiked up her skirts, kicking off her shoes in anticipation of jumping into a tree. Looking down, she realized the ground was far closer than she\u2019d feared.\nExcellent! I can just drop into the garden!\nArnold, who up until now had been rendered speechless, shook himself out of his fugue as Rishe clambered over the railing. \u201cHey!\u201d\nRishe\u2019s moonlight-silver dress flowed around her as she leapt. The lawn was soft, but the fall was still far enough to risk injury.\nWeight evenly distributed on the soles of my feet, roll to transfer the impact to my shins and thighs, then onto my hips and my back.\nShe landed safely, rolled nimbly in her dress, and popped back up. Her hair was covered in leaves. \nI need to hurry up!\nBracing against a nearby rock, she used her weight to snap the heels off of her shoes. There. That would make running a little easier. Satisfied, she slipped them back on and made haste toward the family estate. \n \n***\n \nUp on the balcony, Crown Prince Arnold of Galkhein watched the spectacle play out from beginning to end. He gazed at the girl with the coral hair. Her appearance was that of any young noblewoman, but she moved like a well-trained knight. She\u2019d leapt from the balcony and landed skillfully, showing no signs of distress at her ripped dress or disheveled hair. Instead, she\u2019d knocked the heels off her shoes and dashed away.\nAlso, she had called him an emperor.\nPlaying it all over again in his head, Arnold broke out into a rare chuckle. As his shoulders quivered with laughter, his attendant approached him from behind.\n\u201cThere you are, Your Highness. What are you doing out here? I\u2019m aware you don\u2019t desire a wife, but beginning the search would be wise\u2026 Er, Your Highness?\u201d The attendant\u2019s eyes flew wide. His bored and scowling master was laughing. \u201cDid something happen?\u201d\n\u201cOliver, ready my coach. Wait, no. That will take too much time. Bring me a horse.\u201d\n\u201cAt once, Your Highness. Might I ask why?\u201d\nArnold didn\u2019t respond\u2014he just grinned like a hungry wolf catching scent of his prey.\n \n***\n \nOnce outside the palace gates, Rishe threw herself into the waiting coach, shouting for the driver to make haste. She stopped it a few hundred yards from the manor and bid him farewell. \u201cI\u2019m leaving! Thanks for always being such a safe driver, Daniel!\u201d\nThe road to the manor was muddy from a morning rain shower. She knew from her second life that the coach would get stuck, resulting in a loss of valuable time. It was better to just get out and run. \n\u201cHuff, huff.\u201d Despite her last life\u2019s physical conditioning, this body had no stamina. She\u2019d need to try to get fitter faster this time around.\nRishe reached the end of the road, and her heart promptly sank all the way to her feet. \u201cOh no.\u201d\nThe front door was thronged with people, all of them surrounding a carriage bearing the royal family\u2019s coat of arms.\nI need to get out of here.\nWhile she stood frozen in indecision, one of the knights doing crowd control shouted, \u201cYour Highness! I have eyes on Lady Rishe!\u201d\n\u201cGet out of my way!\u201d A familiar voice started up a bellow. \u201cLet me through! Rishe, how dare you make me wait so long?\u201d\nRishe\u2019s ex-fianc\u00e9, Crown Prince Dietrich, stepped triumphantly forward.\n\u201cI know the thought of hearing your crimes enumerated by the man you love must pain you, but alas, as future king, it is my duty to bring down the hammer of justice upon a villainess such as yourself!\u201d\n\u201cI see I\u2019ve timed it badly,\u201d Rishe muttered. \u201cIn fact, this is my worst loop yet. I\u2019d rather be barred from the house than see you again.\u201d\n\u201cHmm? What are you grumbling about?\u201d Dietrich looked Rishe up and down. \u201cI knew it. You put on a brave face, but I can sense the sorrow in your heart.\u201d\n\u201cI beg your pardon?\u201d\n\u201cYour heart!\u201d the prince repeated. \u201cYour heart! It must be absolutely crushed! Because I called off our engagement!\u201d\nRishe wasn\u2019t sure where he was drawing these conclusions from. Possibly the same place he mined for all his bottomless self-confidence.\n\u201cI can tell you\u2019ve been wandering aimlessly, distraught,\u201d the prince went on. \u201cLook at you. Your dress is caked in mud, your shoes are broken, and there are cuts marring your face and arms. What other possible cause could there be than heartbreak?\u201d\nRishe narrowed her eyes. \u201cDo you ever stop to think about the words coming out of your mouth?\u201d\n\u201cWhat?\u201d\nHis interpretation of events was fanciful to the point of absurd",
    "query_text": "ity. \u201cI did not dirty my dress or snap my shoes out of heartbreak. Because I feel none. You\u2019ve always been a little slow, so I\u2019ll make this clear: I do not have a single shred of fondness for you, or for our broken engagement.\u201d\n\u201cWhat?!\u201d the prince said. \u201cWhat are you saying?!\u201d\nThe surrounding crowd began to snicker.\n\u201cIsn\u2019t that the crown prince? Did Lady Rishe just dump him?\u201d\n\u201cWait, but wasn\u2019t he trying to dump her?\u201d\n\u201cCan\u2019t be! Look at her! She doesn\u2019t care at all!\u201d\n\u201cHow dare you nobodies make sport"

Instead, the assembled looked on in terrified awe.\nNot Rishe, though.\n\u201cWhat are you doing?\u201d she hissed. \u201cGet up!\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m apologizing for my baseless impertinence. Also, I\u2019m asking you\u2026\u201d He trailed off to take Rishe\u2019s hand, tugging her forward so forcefully she staggered. He gazed up at her.\nUgh. He\u2019s so beautiful. No matter how many times she looked at him, it didn\u2019t become any less disarming. Long eyelashes, arched brows, a noble nose. His bright blue eyes reminded her of the drift ice she\u2019d seen in a northern kingdom, gazing out from a ship in one of her past lives. She knew she was dwelling on this to buy time, even as the reality before her sank in.\n\u201c\u2026to become my wife.\u201d\nShe froze, unable to process the words. \u201cWhat?\u201d Rishe glanced around, desperately searching the faces of the crowd. They all seemed as stunned as she felt. She looked down at Arnold again. \u201cYour wife?\u201d \n\u201cYes, that\u2019s right.\u201d\n\u201cYou want me to become your wife?\u201d\n\u201cYes.\u201d\nRishe couldn\u2019t speak. This was truly happening. It was real. It clicked into place in her head, and she let out a strangled grunt.\nWhat is going on? Why is this happening?\nShock lapped at her, fuzzing at the corners of her vision. He wanted to marry her. Arnold wanted to marry Rishe. Her murderer wanted to marry her.\nWhy is he doing this? He must have some ulterior motive, a broader goal. But I have to give him an answer.\nThe onlookers were holding their breath as Rishe said flatly, \u201cI reject your proposal.\u201d\nArnold said nothing.\nShe had to reject him. She was going to live a long, peaceful, carefree life, damn it, and no one would stop her. And yet\u2026\nArnold began to laugh, and the deep, creeping sense of dread inside Rishe only grew. Why does he seem so amused by this?!\n \n***\n \nHer previous life was her sixth. Disguised as a man, Rishe rose as a warrior of an island country she came upon in her travels. It was a conventional yet charming kingdom formed of red brick. After striking up a friendship with a group of knights who didn\u2019t realize she was a woman, Rishe followed their advice and joined them.\nThe training was grueling enough to make her wish she were dead. Back when she had lived as a noble, she\u2019d learned how to wield a sword for basic self-defense, but training as a noble lady had in no way prepared her for this. She drilled relentlessly, barely taking the time to sleep. Just as she became a full-fledged knight, Emperor Arnold\u2019s forces lay siege to the castle.\n \n***\n \nHow could this happen? \nIn her seventh life, Rishe wearily sank into her chair. Across from her sat Arnold, his legs crossed and chin propped up on his hand, watching her lazily.\n\u201cWhat\u2019s the matter?\u201d he asked. \u201cYou seem unhappy.\u201d\n\u201cYou could say that.\u201d Even her voice was grumpy. Still, she couldn\u2019t very well tell him it was because she bore a grudge from a previous life. After the first time her life rewound to that pivotal moment, she\u2019d resolved to keep her loops a secret. \u201cI had plans for my exile. A brand-new life. And now because of you, my parents are involved. Even the king has heard about it!\u201d\nAfter Rishe rejected Arnold, Dietrich had immediately cried out, \u201cTh-the crown prince of Galkhein proposed to Rishe?!\u201d\nHis shrieks were loud enough to attract the attention of the master and mistress of the manor.\nWhen her parents came out, Rishe had protested, \u201cI\u2019m not going to marry him! I\u2019m leaving the country just as Dietrich commanded.\u201d\nNo one listened. Their faces just paled with nervous confusion.\nJust then, a glittering coach arrived. Half-stuck in the mud, the man inside it was forced to trudge over the swampy ground, and so the king of Hermity himself arrived, staggering and dirt-stained. \nHe grabbed hold of his son\u2019s collar, pushing him into a low bow. He then turned to Prince Arnold and said, rather loudly, \u201cYour Highness! Allow me to apologize for my son\u2019s foolishness! You are an esteemed guest all the way from Galkhein! It is unthinkable he would not offer you the courtesy you are due!\u201d\n\u201cYou\u2019re hurting me, Father! My back!\u201d\nThe king then turned to Rishe. \u201cMy lady, allow me to sincerely apologize as both a king and a father. My son\u2019s behavior toward you has been utterly disgraceful. I beg you to please give Prince Arnold\u2019s proposal due consideration. Not only for your own sake but for the sake of your country.\u201d\nThe king bowed to her as deeply as his son had to Arnold, and her parents joined him. Rishe felt dizzy at the sight of this abject debasement in the presence of citizens.\nArnold, who had been watching the proceedings with a detached amusement, sobered and stepped toward the king. \u201cYour Majesty, please rise.\u201d\nWithout the smirk, Arnold\u2019s face immediately reverted to its cold mask. The king didn\u2019t move. Maybe something in Arnold\u2019s voice kept him frozen.\n\u201cSuch a trifle won\u2019t cause discord between our kingdoms,\u201d he went on. \u201cHowever, I would beg a little time to speak with Lady Rishe.\u201d\nLater, Rishe would learn that Arnold\u2019s attendant had spoken to the king\u2019s own gentleman, certain that his words would reach their target. \u201cMy master took such trouble to attend these festivities, and this is the welcome he is offered? I wonder, what will the emperor think when he learns of his son\u2019s slighting at your nation\u2019s hands?\u201d\n\u201cIf you would, Lady Rishe?\u201d The plump king looked to be on the verge of tears.\nRishe had no obligation to accept and no desire to spend a moment longer in this country than was absolutely necessary. But acquiescence seemed the fastest way to move things along.\nAs her mind whirled, Arnold leaned in to whisper, \u201cIf you refuse to hear my suit, you won\u2019t deter me. I\u2019ll simply move on to Plan B.\u201d\nAnd that was how she found herself in one of the palace\u2019s parlors, here to \u201cjust talk\u201d to Prince Arnold. The ball guests were all gone. It was just the two of them.\n\u201cI want to know what you\u2019re planning,\u201d Rishe said flatly.\n\u201cPlanning? Me?\u201d\n\u201cBy asking me to marry you. You don\u2019t know me. A proposal like this wouldn\u2019t come out of the blue.\u201d\nThis man was destined to become an aggressive warmonger over the next few years. He wouldn\u2019t do anything without a dozen motives.\nPrince Arnold just smiled. \u201cI have no plans. I\u2019m simply enamored with you.\u201d\n\u201cEnamored\u2026?\u201d\nThat was the last thing she\u2019d expected him to say. Asking him to elaborate didn\u2019t seem worth the breath\u2014he was obviously lying. As if this ruthless, inhuman creature with ice in his veins could feel even a flicker of affection.\n\u201cWhy refuse me?\u201d Arnold asked. \u201cYour engagement is broken, you\u2019re on the verge of exile, and you have no faction or supporters. At this rate, you\u2019ll be dead within a fortnight. I\u2019d call my offer a stroke of unbelievable fortune.\u201d\n\u201cYou\u2019re not wrong,\u201d Rishe admitted. \u201cOnce upon a time, I would have jumped at your offer.\u201d\nIf it had been made in her first life, for instance. But now Rishe knew better. Her life was only just getting started, and the future held endless possibilities. After the horror of her sixth loop, she yearned for freedom.\nI don\u2019t want to marry him. I won\u2019t be anyone\u2019s captive. Still\u2026\nRishe, more than anyone, knew that the slightest adjustment could enact profound changes on the trajectory of a life. No doubt she\u2019d have many more lives, but this could be the only one where marriage to Arnold would be an option.\nThe dread emperor. The tyrant. The man who will stoke the fires of war. \nRishe knew the gossip, the endless conjecture behind Arnold Hein\u2019s bloody reign, but she didn\u2019t know the truth.\nWhy? The question had haunted her since her first life. She\u2019d never before had the chance to even speak to him.\nShe had wondered it as a merchant, hearing of the distant outbreak of war. She\u2019d wondered when the news of the dead and dying reached her apothecary. When she had comforted her terrified mistress in her life as a maid, assuring her everything would be all right. When she squared off against him in battle, as he plunged a sword through her heart\u2014even then she wondered. \nIf I stick around, maybe I\u2019ll finally have my answer. Half of her was dying to know. The other half didn\u2019t give a damn. And yet\u2026\nShe recalled a childhood dream. Rather, a longing.\nRishe let out a breath. \u201cYou claim you are enamored with me.\u201d\n\u201cYes. I am completely under your spell.\u201d\nTo think he could spout such nonsense with a straight face!\n\u201cThen will you grant me anything I desire?\u201d\n\u201cSo long as it is within my power,\u201d Arnold said. \u201cAnything you want will be yours.\u201d\nRishe hesitated, gathering her thoughts. \u201cI have some conditions.\u201d Arnold silently motioned for her to go on. \u201cI want full control over the wedding festivities. Everything must be procured through merchants of my choosing.\u201d\n\u201cFine.\u201d Arnold nodded. \u201cYou\u2019re free to do business with whomever you wish.\u201d\n\u201cAfter we are married, I must be in a position to mingle with guests from abroad.\u201d\n\u201cThat sounds within the purview of the crown princess. Anything else?\u201d\n\u201cI will be allowed to live in a separate residence from your mother and father.\u201d\nShe meant this seriously, but it made Arnold laugh. \u201cYou don\u2019t seem the type to worry about an overbearing mother-in-law.\u201d\n\u201cYou would be surprised. Combative relationships with one\u2019s new family are the most difficult part of marriage, or so they say. It could be a ramshackle cottage for all I care\u2014I just require a secondary residence.\u201d\nActually, Rishe didn\u2019t care at all about in-laws. When Arnold set his war into motion, his first move would be the assassination of his father. A genuine coup by patricide, not at all like Dietrich\u2019s clumsy attempt. Next, he would name himself emperor, take control of the country, and mobilize the military.\nSeparating him from his parents will make the first step more difficult\u2014although not impossible, unfortunately.\n\u201cAnything else?\u201d Arnold asked. \u201cI\u2019ll do whatever it takes to marry you.\u201d\n\u201cIdeally, I\u2019d like to know your endgame,\u201d Rishe said with dignity. \u201cBut as I doubt there\u2019s any chance of that, I have one final request.\u201d She jabbed a finger into his face, regardless of how rude it was. \u201cI will spend my time idling around the castle. No work, no study. I shall be utterly useless.\u201d\nLet\u2019s see just how much you want me as your princess.\nAfter a long moment of silence, Arnold cracked a merry laugh. The proposal remained; all her conditions were met.\n\n(2) chapter number given is likely out of range: 0\nChapter: 7\n\nChapter 2\nChapter 2\n \n\u201cYOU KNOW, it was only after I went into commerce that I truly had a dream for the future,\u201d Rishe had once confided in a friend. \u201cUp until then, I existed only as the crown prince\u2019s fianc\u00e9e or my father\u2019s daughter. My every act was to become more worthy of that status. But now, for the first time, I actually have a goal of my own.\u201d\n\u201cOh, yeah?\u201d her friend said. He was the ruler of the desert kingdom, and his smile was awfully charming. \u201cWhat\u2019s that?\u201d\nRishe smiled back. \u201cI want to travel to every single country in the world. I want to see everything in every town, peruse their markets, and meet the eyes of every person who lives there!\u201d\nBy now, that felt like such a distant dream.\n \n***\n \nRishe awoke with a start, eyes snapping open as she sensed a disturbance in the air.\nShe unsheathed her sword halfway, primed for danger. \nInside the coach, her old enemy sat across from her, one hand outstretched. \u201cWhat do you think you\u2019re doing?\u201d she demanded.\nWhen they\u2019d boarded the coach, Rishe had warned him not to lay a single finger on her throughout the trip to his kingdom. Ordering the prince not to touch his consort was absurd, but Arnold readily agreed. He had, after all, promised to follow her every direction.\nAnd yet, here he was, already breaking his promise.\nArnold appeared unperturbed by her glare. \u201cDon\u2019t look at me like that. I was merely trying to recover what you took from me.\u201d\nConfused, Rishe looked at the sword in her hand. It had a black lacquered scabbard with a simple golden decoration. Engraved on the hilt was the Galkhein crest.\n\u201cOh!\u201d Rishe thrust the sword back at Arnold. \u201cMy apologies.\u201d\nArnold chuckled. \u201cYou caught me off guard. You were nodding off, and then you suddenly snatched up my sword. You looked quite content snuggling up with it.\u201d\nArnold propped the sword beside him. Rishe pressed a hand to her chest to quell her racing heart. The sword that gutted me in my previous life is now my bedmate. What a world. Her recent stint as a knight had left her ill at ease without a blade at hand. She just couldn\u2019t believe it was Arnold\u2019s she\u2019d reached for.\n\u201cI didn\u2019t mean to disturb you, but I doubted sleeping with a weapon would be comfortable. I\u2019m impressed you sensed my intent before I even touched you.\u201d Arnold rested one elbow against the window frame, watching her with shameless fascination. \u201cOne only develops instincts like that from combat training. And you were also a member of the court? How in the world did you find the time?\u201d\nRishe shrugged. She couldn\u2019t just say, I pretended to be a man in a previous life, that\u2019s how.\n\u201cI assume there\u2019s more to you than your devotion to the sword. You seem to like flowers.\u201d\nShe followed Arnold\u2019s gaze to where she\u2019d bundled a small bouquet in a handkerchief. This was their fifth day on the road to Galkhein. Every day, without fail, she\u2019d picked flowers whenever they stopped to water the horses. The ones from today were still fresh, but the ones she\u2019d begun drying five days ago were just about ready.\n\u201cI didn\u2019t pick these because they\u2019re pretty.\u201d Rishe brought the blooms to her face, spirits rising at their sweet scent. Spring wildflowers had a soft and gentle smell. Rishe looked out the window at the forest spreading toward Galkhein, thinking of the rare native flowers going into bloom. She wished she could pick those as well, but that would cause too much delay. She gazed on wistfully.\nAfter watching her in silence for some time, Arnold said, \u201cBy the way, I sent one of my men ahead on a fast horse to deliver your order to the company you requested. They\u2019ll be invited to Galkhein to discuss the wedding ceremony.\u201d\n\u201cThank you,\u201d Rishe said. \u201cI\u2019m glad you kept your word.\u201d\n\u201cThe Aria Trading Company,\u201d Arnold mused. \u201cI\u2019ve heard of them. They\u2019re up-and-comers, aren\u2019t they? Have you done business with them before?\u201d\n\u201cNo, but I heard from a friend that they hold a very high standard of quality.\u201d\nRishe was pleasantly surprised at how easily Arnold had acceded to her request. Typically, a royal household had their own personal dealer. Getting them to do business with someone else could be difficult.\nI want to establish a connection with Aria as soon as possible, Rishe thought. It was, of course, the company that had taken her in during her first life.\nThe company had been established just two years prior to picking her up by its owner, a man named Tully. They were still in their growth stage, but in just a few years, they would be the grandest trading company in all the world. They\u2019d proven a great boon in her life as an apothecary as well, helping to distribute her newest medicines. She\u2019d struggled to win their trust initially, but she pledged to work much harder this time around.\nThis marriage isn\u2019t going to happen\u2014I need an escape plan for when it all falls apart. I must bring to bear all my knowledge and influence as a crown princess.\nRishe didn\u2019t know Arnold\u2019s plans, but",
    "query_text": " she had no intention of sitting around and waiting for him to use her as he pleased. She\u2019d spend her time as his consort wisely. Everything must serve her ultimate goal: to live longer than five years, and live well.\nHer fierce determination must have shown on her face because Arnold gave her a little bemused smile. \u201cYes?\u201d\nGod! Rishe grimaced at that flawlessly"

    "prefix_text": " gleamed in the sunlight, just as the knight had said.\nThey applied the poison liberally\u2014whatever it is must be cheap and easily bought in bulk.\nShe wafted the smell toward her, bracing for something rancid, but detected nothing. Then she brought it closer to her nose.\nIt smells sweet, like an overripe apple. Shea grass and\u2026bluecap mushrooms. All the knights appear to have the same symptoms, so I won\u2019t have to check every blade.\nRishe stood back up and headed for the coach.\nOliver took a step after her. \u201cYour Highness, Lady Rishe is\u2014\u201d\n\u201cLeave her. She may do as she pleases.\u201d\n\u201cShe\u2019s well trained,\u201d Oliver mused. \u201cBut a battlefield is no place for a young lady. She probably wasn\u2019t prepared for such a dreadful spectacle.\u201d\nRishe ignored the murmurs and focused on her work. There they are. I\u2019ll take these, these, and\u2026\n\u201cThe poison must be a sleeping drug,\u201d she overheard Arnold saying. \u201cHunters use such drugs to weaken larger prey. I doubt this dose is lethal.\u201d\n\u201cBut it certainly is annoying,\u201d replied Oliver. \u201cWe\u2019re still two days out from Galkhein. Lugging a company of sleeping men in armor won\u2019t be pleasant.\u201d\n\u201cWe\u2019ll have to stop somewhere nearby. A hunter\u2019s settlement. Perhaps they will have an antidote\u2014\u201d\n\u201cExcuse me.\u201d Rishe, who\u2019d returned from the carriage, raised a hand. \u201cI have an antidote.\u201d\n\u201cWhat?\u201d\nThe entire company stared at her in awe.\n \n***\n \nAs it turned out, Arnold\u2019s guess was right. \nThis sweet-smelling substance was a hunter\u2019s drug, made from ingredients that were only toxic in their raw form. Heat rendered them harmless. Rishe had encountered this poison several times before, curing a customer afflicted with it during her life as an apothecary.\n\u201cA lethal dose for a grown man would fill a wine glass. They likely got less than a hundredth of that,\u201d Rishe explained to Arnold, not looking up from her work. \u201cStill, the numbness can block their airways with the roots of their tongues. It\u2019s best to lay them on their sides.\u201d\n\u201cYes, I understand the theory and the solution.\u201d Arnold gazed down at Rishe\u2019s hands. \u201cThe part I\u2019m struggling with is why you\u2019re the one telling me this.\u201d\n\u201cWell, I know how to make the antidote,\u201d Rishe said patiently as she muddled the herbs together in the white soup bowl she\u2019d borrowed for her flowers. She crushed them with the back of a spoon before adding another dried flower, crushing that as well, and combining them to form a paste. This process would be easier with a pestle, but she wasn\u2019t about to complain. \u201cThis poison is common\u2014it\u2019s cheap and easy to make, which often means the antidote is simple as well.\u201d\nThe antidote was synthesized, in fact, when hunters witnessed a deer showing no symptoms after eating a certain mushroom. They tested those along with other common herbs the deer ate. Rishe mentally thanked them for their scientific rigor as she added a bit of water, straining it all through a cloth.\nRishe stood up, brandishing the bowl of bright green medicine. \u201cBoiling would make the antidote more potent, but this works in a pinch.\u201d\nThat was when she noticed the astonished stares. Unsure of what social faux paus she\u2019d perpetrated, she looked away. Oliver was completely stunned. Arnold looked thoughtful. It was imperative the knights were treated as soon as possible, but to Rishe\u2019s dismay, no one was moving. \nDo they not trust me? That makes sense. Anyone would be reluctant to use medicine concocted by a complete stranger. But the longer we wait, the harder the poison will become to cure. \nShe needed to dispel their doubts. Rolling up her sleeve, Rishe approached Arnold and drew his sword from its scabbard. \u201cI need to borrow this for a moment, Your Highness.\u201d\n\u201cWhat are you\u2014\u201d\nShe pushed the blade against the soft skin of her inner arm. Blood welled up, along with the sharp sting of pain. Nothing compared to her injuries sustained during her life as a knight, though.\nArnold did not share her nonchalance. \u201cWhat do you think you\u2019re doing?!\u201d\nHe grabbed for her arm. She stepped out of his grasp. Was blood truly so shocking? She didn\u2019t have the time to worry about it. Clutching the overfull bowl, Rishe hurried back to the knights.\n\u201cDon\u2019t worry. This isn\u2019t poison,\u201d Rishe said. She demonstrated as much by drizzling it with a spoon over her own fresh wound. It stung. That meant the ingredients were working.\n\u201cThis is crushed liquori grass, luqua flowers, and carilya nuts. I\u2019ll swallow some if that\u2019s what it takes to prove it\u2019s safe.\u201d It was horribly bitter; she hoped it wouldn\u2019t come to that. \u201cThe paralysis will last for days. Please make up your mind quickly.\u201d\n\u201cMake up our mind?\u201d\n\u201cWill you allow me to cure the poison? Or would you rather drag paralyzed soldiers all the way to Galkhein? I suppose you could waste His Highness\u2019s time searching for a hunter\u2019s settlement to use their antidote.\u201d She smiled serenely. \u201cIt makes no difference to us. Right, Your Highness?\u201d\nIn the end, Rishe applied the antidote.\nThe recovery took a few hours. While they waited, Rishe picked herbs in the same meadow she\u2019d been gazing at with yearning from the carriage. A fortuitous turn of events. She found anti-inflammatory herbs and flowers to ease sour bellies, ingredients for curing headaches, and mushrooms for inducing slumber. She wrapped them all up in a handkerchief.\nIn the meantime, Arnold dispatched a messenger to this region\u2019s lord, making arrangements to deliver the apprehended bandits. After coordinating with Oliver, he drifted over to Rishe.\n\u201cI see your interest in flowers is mercenary, rather than ornamental,\u201d he said, surveying the heaps of herbs gathered on the bank of the pond. He sat down beside her.\nWhen he didn\u2019t say anything more, Rishe went back to work plucking leaves from plants with valuable stems. The leaves had no medicinal effects, but they did make a decent broth. Slumber mushroom spores were a nuisance unless dried; they were spread out beside her in the sun.\nI wonder, would he be annoyed if I attached herbs to the roof of the coach? That would be unusual adornment for a crown prince\u2019s retinue, but it wouldn\u2019t hurt to ask.\nShe realized, quite suddenly, that Arnold was looking at her. At her hands, specifically. He sat cross-legged with his chin propped on his fist, staring absently, like a kid watching a column of ants march by.\nWhat is so fascinating about herbs?\nTheir eyes met. \u201cAm I bothering you?\u201d he asked.\nRishe shook her head slowly. \u201cNot at all. I was just curious what caught your eye.\u201d\n\u201cNothing specific. I was just thinking how very unusual you are.\u201d He was smiling again. \u201cI\u2019m looking forward to how you\u2019ll surprise me next.\u201d\nLike I\u2019m some sort of rare pet he bought to entertain him. She didn\u2019t like that. Nothing she\u2019d done was at all remarkable\u2014normal tasks performed by a normal person.\n\u201cI didn\u2019t make that antidote for your amusement.\u201d\n\u201cI realize that.\u201d The instigating smile faded from his lips. \u201cYou know, those knights you coerced into taking your home-brewed medicine were all born in the slums.\u201d\n\u201cCoerced? That\u2019s hardly the word I\u2019d use.\u201d\n\u201cGalkhein claims to value merit above all else, but in the end, people are judged by where they came from. Despite this, those men fought their way up from nothing.\u201d\nRishe paused in plucking the seeds from a flower and looked up at Arnold.\n\u201cThe men with the worst cases of the paralysis were all newly assigned. They\u2019ve spent weeks training to ensure this mission was a success. That older knight\u2014the one who bowed to you\u2014sustained an injury protecting the rookies. He cares deeply about his men.\u201d\n\u201cYou seem to care about them too,\u201d Rishe commented.\n\u201cI handpicked them for my retinue.\u201d Arnold clambered to his feet, only to fall into a bow. \u201cAnd you kept them safe. You have my deepest gratitude.\u201d\nRishe found herself at a loss for words. Was this Arnold putting on a mask to hide the monster within? Or was this the real him? She remembered the way he\u2019d looked when he held his blade to the bandit\u2019s throat, like a child poised to break a toy he had grown bored of.\n\u201cDon\u2019t mention it,\u201d Rishe said, uncomfortable. \u201cI knew how to do it, so I did.\u201d\nArnold laughed softly. \u201cBe that as it may, I\u2019d still count a noblewoman who can brew remedies from wildflowers by the side of the road a rare find.\u201d\n\u201cEarlier, when you grabbed my wrist\u2026\u201d Rishe steered the subject away from her incongruous knowledge. \u201cYou broke your promise. You said you wouldn\u2019t touch me.\u201d\n\u201cThat was reflex,\u201d Arnold protested. \u201cI thought you were going to hurt yourself.\u201d\nSuch a simple conversation, so casual. It had Rishe feeling positively peculiar.\n\u201cWhy are your knights so wary around me?\u201d she asked. \n\u201cWary? Oh, they were all at the palace when you broke your first engagement. They\u2019re most likely concerned I\u2019m bringing home a villainous jilt who will lead to my ruin. Something silly like that.\u201d\n\u201cI see.\u201d Apparently, being dumped by a prince called into question one\u2019s herbalist abilities.\n\u201cI\u2019m glad you mentioned it,\u201d Arnold went on, \u201cbecause there may be people in Galkhein who will oppose our union. I will do everything in my power to protect you, but you must bring any insults or threats to me right away.\u201d\n\u201cAre there likely to be many?\u201d\n\u201cIn theory, the crown prince may choose his own wife, but the done thing is, of course, to marry a princess. I assume a duke\u2019s daughter would have at least some ties to the royal family?\u201d\nHe assumed correctly. She was in the family tree, if a rather distant branch.\n\u201cMy father has ordered me to choose a bride from a different kingdom rather than a woman of my own land because\u2014\u201d\n\u201cOne never knows when a hostage will come in handy,\u201d Rishe finished for him.\nGalkhein was an expansionist empire. Currently, peace reigned\u2014but peace was precarious. If Galkhein demanded any of the countries to hand over a princess bride, then none were in a position to refuse. With his daughter in the hands of a foreign power, no king would dare oppose a war that power cared to wage.\n\u201cI sent a message to my father telling him I happened upon a close relation of Hermity\u2019s king\u2014a duke\u2019s daughter who had been recently tossed aside by her fianc\u00e9e,\u201d Arnold said. \u201cI also may have implied I was the reason for your falling out\u2014yours and the prince\u2019s. Why, when I saw a woman so powerful and connected and beloved, I couldn\u2019t help but plunder you.\u201d\n\u201cPlunder me? That\u2019s certainly one way to describe it.\u201d Dietrich had kicked up an almighty fuss, despite being the one who broke the engagement.\n\u201cMy father approves of you because he sees you as a bargaining chip. There will be others who aren\u2019t prepared to accept you so willingly.\u201d\n\u201cIs that so?\u201d Rishe said steadily.\n\u201cNever fear,\u201d Arnold responded. \u201cThey\u2019ll eat their words, every one of them. They will receive you as their crown princess if they value their\u2014\u201d\n\u201cNo, being a hostage is perfect.\u201d \nArnold stared at her. \u201cHm?\u201d\n\u201cAs a hostage, I\u2019ll have no official duties, will I? We can pretend I\u2019m here only under great duress, and there will be no need for my comment on governmental or diplomatic affairs.\u201d\nArnold hesitated. \u201cI suppose not.\u201d\n\u201cExcellent! Then I can live my dream of being utterly useless.\u201d Rishe trembled with delight. The thought of acting as an ambassador had really been weighing on her mind. Being a princess was nonstop work. Having been groomed for the position from an early age, Rishe knew members of the royal family barely even had time to sleep.\nBut prisoners didn\u2019t have places in government.\n\u201cThis is such a weight off my mind,\u201d Rishe admitted. \u201cThank you so much for keeping your promise, Your Highness.\u201d\n\u201cEr, of course.\u201d\n\u201cBut don\u2019t worry, I won\u2019t shirk my duties as wedding planner.\u201d Nearly ready to collapse with relief, Rishe returned to her herbs.\n \n***\n \nAfter the bandit incident, Rishe felt the knights begin to ease a bit in her presence.\nDespite their initial reluctance to accept her help, they continued to report the injured men\u2019s progress and bring any concerns directly to her. In return, they took over gathering herbs from the surrounding countryside on their rest stops.\nShe hadn\u2019t done it for gratitude, but she was nonetheless touched. Gathering medicinal herbs had been second nature ever since her life as an apothecary, and it was foolish to ever turn down loyalty.\nSeveral days after the altercation with the bandits, the coach train finally arrived in the",
    "query_text": " imperial capital of Galkhein.\n\u201cOh my,\u201d Rishe murmured as they passed through the gates.\nWhite stone buildings stood in straight rows, lining clean, orderly streets. The first stories all appeared to be shops, while the second-floor windows were festooned with flowers. Everywhere she looked were smiling faces, citizens turned out to witness their prince\u2019s return over the smooth brick roads. Overlooking it all was the towering magnificence of the imperial palace.\n\u201cThe capital is the seat of power in Galkhein,\u201d Arnold explained. \u201cSeveral key trade routes converge here.\u201d\nRishe nodded, suddenly anxious to be out of the coach."

She had a mop of blazing-red hair. \u201cAnother newbie?\u201d\nAn understandable mistake. Rishe\u2019s dress was simple, free of ornamentation, and her hair was bound back in a ponytail to keep it out of the way. She was dust-streaked, sweaty, and carrying a bucket in her arms.\nTelling them who I am will be more trouble than it\u2019s worth. Her silence only angered the girls more.\n\u201cAre you one of the crown princess\u2019s maids? They\u2019ve been snatching up every new girl. Those pretty hands of yours don\u2019t look like they\u2019ve ever held a broom,\u201d said one of them.\n\u201cUnfortunately for you, we\u2019ve been working here three years, and we\u2019ll be the ones to serve Prince Arnold as the maids of his palace.\u201d\n\u201cCan you stand? Oh, good, it looks like you\u2019re not injured.\u201d Rishe helped the girl up out of the dirt. \n\u201cHey, don\u2019t ignore us!\u201d the redheaded maid shouted. \u201cYou\u2019ve got some nerve. If you want to make it here, you\u2019ll know your place! I doubt the two of you will last a week!\u201d\nRishe didn\u2019t respond, her attention snagging on something else. The redhead was carrying curtains, probably to bring them to the wash. Rishe stared at them so hard the maid began to shift uncomfortably. \u201cWhat\u2019s your problem?\u201d\n\u201cYou should wait to wash those,\u201d Rishe said.\nThe girl glared daggers at her. \u201cExcuse me? Are you telling me it\u2019s too late in the day? You really are an amateur! The light lasts longer in the spring, you know. And it\u2019s hot today. There\u2019ll be plenty of\u2014\u201d \n\u201cIt\u2019s going to rain, is all.\u201d\nThe maids exchanged glances. \u201cHow can you be so sure?\u201d\n\u201cLook at the clouds amassing. The butterflies and the bees are flying low. The moisture in the air will make the drying take longer.\u201d\n\u201cWhat?\u201d\nAnother maid spoke up in a soft voice. \u201cDiana, you were the one who said we should take the initiative to wash the bigger pieces. You said the crown prince would choose us for his household!\u201d\n\u201cStop putting the blame on me! This isn\u2019t my fault.\u201d An indignant flush crept over the redhead\u2019s face. \u201cThere\u2019s no way some upstart can tell what time it\u2019s going to rain! The weather is going to be fantastic all day. Come on, we\u2019re hauling these over to the wash!\u201d\nThe three girls meekly followed Diana.\nRishe sighed, turning to the blonde girl. \u201cAre you hurt?\u201d\n\u201cNo, I\u2019m fine.\u201d The girl\u2019s gaze darted around nervously. \u201cI\u2019m Elsie. Thank you for helping me.\u201d Her face was studiously blank, but from the way she struggled with her words, Rishe could tell she was being genuine.\n\u201cDon\u2019t worry about it,\u201d Rishe said. \u201cYour uniform seems to have fared less well.\u201d\n\u201cOh no.\u201d Elsie looked down at herself. Her face remained vacant, but she seemed sad. \u201cAnd I just got it.\u201d \n\u201cYou can get the dirt out if you wash it straight away. It\u2019s going to rain, but this dress should dry quickly. Use lots of soap, but don\u2019t scrub it by hand\u2014scrape the mud off with a brush.\u201d\n\u201cWhy a brush?\u201d\n\u201cBecause your fingers will just grind dirt into the threads. A brush is more porous.\u201d\nThe young sons of the family Rishe served spent their time tumbling in the dirt, and she had plenty of experience scraping mud out of clothes. She could even salvage dirty socks that had spent days crumpled in the corner.\n\u201cDo you\u2026 Are you\u2026\u201d Elsie trailed off, blinking rapidly a couple of times before finally looking Rishe in the eyes. \u201cAre you the crown princess\u2019s maid?\u201d\nUnsure how to answer, Rishe couldn\u2019t meet her eyes.\n \n***\n \nAfter parting ways with Elsie, Rishe returned to the detached wing with her fresh water. She put clean sheets on the bed the knights had installed, satisfied that she had a comfortable place to sleep. This room also had the highest-up balcony in the whole detached palace.\nTaking a break, she wandered out onto the balcony and looked off over the capital, the golden afternoon tinged with the onset of twilight. The day was fresh with a recent rain, the air clear enough to see for miles. The spring breeze felt good against her skin, sweaty from cleaning. Rishe leaned against the railing, leaning her head back and closing her eyes.\nShe felt like collapsing into bed immediately, but she desperately needed a wash. Still, she didn\u2019t want to pull herself away from the view and the breeze just yet. When she resumed gazing out absentmindedly, something her mother once said drifted back to her. \n\u201cRishe, there is no need for you to think for yourself.\u201d\nShe frowned, the memories coming thick and fast now.\n\u201cYou mustn\u2019t forget that the duty of our family is to live our lives fully devoted to the kings of the land. You\u2019re smart, but all the thinking in the world won\u2019t do a woman any good. You need only concern yourself with how best to serve the crown prince.\u201d\n\u201cStudies? Focus on social etiquette\u2014that\u2019s what you need for navigating high society. The crown prince\u2019s bride must be flawless. Your smile is lacking. You must always strive to appear amiable.\u201d\nRishe breathed out a long sigh. When I was fifteen, their lectures were the only thing I thought about.\nHer parents preached constantly. \u201cA woman\u2019s true happiness is to marry a suitable man and give birth to his heirs.\u201d\n\u201cBut, Mother\u2026\u201d\nObjection was not permitted. Any argument was immediately dispensed with. As a woman, Rishe could not inherit her father\u2019s title. Her only value was in her marriage. \nDespite knowing now that the opinions of others were as worthless as empty titles, the words still echoed in her memories.\nRishe\u2019s fingertips twitched, and she opened her eyes. Unmoving, she said, \u201cShouldn\u2019t you be seeing to your duties?\u201d\n\u201cMore hidden depths, I see,\u201d came a voice tinged with pleasure. Rishe straightened and turned. There was Arnold, leaning against the door to the balcony. \u201cYou seem able to sense my approach no matter how far or how hard I try.\u201d\n\u201cYou\u2019re quite naughty, aren\u2019t you? You\u2019ve been making your presence known little by little, emanating threat, to see how quickly I catch on.\u201d\n\u201cSo you noticed that as well.\u201d Arnold joined Rishe on the balcony. She tensed, but all he did was cast a curious glance at the view. \u201cWhat were you looking at?\u201d\n\u201cThe city.\u201d Rishe was hardly going to tell him she\u2019d been looking at nothing, merely ruminating on her mother\u2019s overbearing advice. The view from the balcony was spectacular, though. \u201cWhat\u2019s that over there?\u201d\n\u201cYou mean the library? The state invested funds to expand it. We have books from all over the world.\u201d\n\u201cReally? You have a library that big?\u201d Rishe\u2019s eyes sparkled with delight. She pointed out another building. \u201cWhat about that spire? It\u2019s beautiful.\u201d\n\u201cThe church and clock tower. The bells ring out the hour.\u201d\n\u201cOoh, how wonderful! And it looks like there\u2019s a rather big market there too?\u201d\n\u201cYes, the largest market in the city. Carts line up in the early morning. Most of the offerings are made fresh every day",
    "query_text": ".\u201d\n\u201cAmazing! And what about that pretty mountain over there?\u201d\nRishe tried and failed to contain her excitement. She couldn\u2019t help but imagine what seeing all these places up close would be like. The grand library, the beautiful church that told the time, and the morning market with fresh, delicious food\u2014she wanted to experience it all.\nSeeing Arnold\u2019s bemused face, she said, \u201cWhat?\u201d"

I should take advantage of this opportunity to touch my betrothed.\u201d\n\u201cWe\u2019re wearing gloves.\u201d\nArnold took Rishe\u2019s hand.\nA throng of guests was gathered in the ballroom as a group of musicians performed on a platform. Women in gowns stood clustered, while gentlemen in military attire grouped together. A mere glance was enough to tell their clothes were of the highest quality. They mingled happily, making small talk with glasses in hand.\nRishe let her hand rest on Arnold\u2019s arm as she paused at the threshold to take it all in. \u201cThis is a bigger event than I was expecting.\u201d\n\u201cIs it? I\u2019d say it\u2019s a rather small gathering, actually.\u201d\n\u201cMaybe for a military powerhouse,\u201d Rishe muttered. \nYet another reminder of Galkhein\u2019s wealth took her off guard. Arnold just looked bored.\n\u201cThe size doesn\u2019t matter,\u201d he said. \u201cIn the end, they\u2019re only here for gossip. Look, here they come.\u201d\nIn the blink of an eye, they were surrounded by guests.\n\u201cPrince Arnold, thank you for gracing us with an invitation,\u201d said one man. \u201cSuch a pleasure.\u201d \n\u201cThe pleasure is mine, Lord Abel,\u201d Arnold drawled.\n\u201cYour Highness! We were so glad to hear of your safe return,\u201d another guest chirped. \u201cPlease, our daughter is simply dying to be regaled with tales of your trip.\u201d\n\u201cI can\u2019t imagine I\u2019d have anything particularly exciting to share with her,\u201d Arnold said curtly.\nAfter the last few days, Rishe found this look of glazed apathy disturbing. His good looks only compounded it\u2014he was so handsome that every expression was stark.\nHe looks more like Emperor Arnold Hein now, but still not the same.\nArnold appeared to notice her watching him. When he looked at her, his sourness disappeared, replaced by a genuine smile. All around him, women found themselves flushing. Arnold paid no heed to their fervent gazes, instead leaning in to give Rishe a brief moment of consideration.\nThen he leaned in close enough to kiss her.\n\u201cA dull trip,\u201d he said again, pulling away. \u201cBut fortuitous. Without it, I would have never met the woman destined to be my wife.\u201d\nA shocked murmur rolled through the crowd. Rishe, who hadn\u2019t recovered from seeing Arnold\u2019s beautiful face at close range, barely noticed the looks of utter loathing the assembled women were throwing her.\n\u201cH-His Highness is smiling? At his hostage bride?\u201d\n\u201cHe called her his wife?! He\u2019s never even looked at us!\u201d\nThey were whispers, but they carried.\nA portly man stepped forward with his daughter in tow. \u201cYour Highness, do you mean to say that this lovely young woman is your fianc\u00e9e?\u201d\nEvery eye in the ballroom was on Rishe, alight with curiosity, envy, or schemes. None of them could hide their contempt. But Rishe didn\u2019t falter.\nThis is nothing compared to being publicly dumped in a banquet hall. And I\u2019ve done that seven times!\nShe offered a polite smile and an astoundingly correct curtsy. Left leg at a diagonal behind the right, back straight, head bowed. \u201cHow do you do? My name is Rishe Irmgard Weitzner.\u201d\nEven the most hostile guests could find nothing impolite in her greeting, no sign of rough manners from the rustic daughter of a backwater nation. Rishe had years of training in expectation of ascending to the throne. Occasionally, habits from her other lives slipped through, but Arnold appeared to be the only one who noticed.\nNow he was looking at her with satisfaction. \u201cLady Rishe has only just arrived, and her acquaintances are few and far between. I hope I can count on you all to hold me accountable should I prove an incompetent husband.\u201d\n\u201cB-but of course, Your Highness.\u201d\n\u201cCome, Rishe.\u201d Arnold guided her out of the ring of spectators. The stares continued to follow them as they walked away.\nRishe dropped her voice to a whisper. \u201cYou sure know how to invite the ire of women.\u201d\n\u201cWhatever do you mean?\u201d\n\u201cThe way you harped on about me. Everything you said was tailor-made to stoke their jealousy. You\u2019ve gained me enemies, so thanks for that.\u201d\nArnold snorted. \u201cEverything I said was to protect you from enemies. They need to know you aren\u2019t just some trophy they can eliminate without recourse. We need to show them this to forestall any potential moves against you in the future.\n\u201cShow them what, exactly?\u201d\n\u201cThat I\u2019ll protect you no matter what.\u201d\nHe said it with such nonchalance that it brought her up short. Protect me? Arnold Hein, protect me?\nSuch an ironic position to take. She couldn\u2019t tell him that, of course. Her response came out somewhat strangled. \u201cI doubt they\u2019ll be anything to worry about. In fact, the biggest threat facing me is you.\u201d\n\u201cOh? And why do you say that?\u201d\n\u201cFor many reasons, the most obvious being that I\u2019m no match for you with a blade.\u201d As much as it pained her to admit it.\nArnold looked pleased. \u201cPerhaps we should duel.\u201d\n\u201cYes, please! And if it wouldn\u2019t be an intrusion\u2014I would like to train with you.\u201d If she studied him, she could learn his strategies and his attack patterns. She\u2019d never be a match in speed or raw power, but any insight would be invaluable.\n\u201cSure.\u201d Arnold shrugged. \u201cI don\u2019t mind.\u201d\n\u201cTruly?\u201d Her eyes glittered with anticipation.\nHe chuckled. \u201cYour answers never disappoint me.\u201d\n\u201cWhat\u2019s that supposed to mean? Oh, it looks like they\u2019re playing a new song.\u201d\nA soft melody drifted across the hall. The crowd divided, heading toward the center of the floor or against the wall. The next dance was starting, and everyone was waiting to see what the crown prince and his new fianc\u00e9e would do.\n\u201cWe don\u2019t have to dance if you don\u2019t want to,\u201d Arnold said.\n\u201cOh? As it happens, I like dancing.\u201d Plus, she couldn\u2019t resist a blatant challenge. She offered him her hand.\n\u201cVery well, then.\u201d Arnold only hesitated for a moment before taking it and steering her gently to an empty spot on the floor. He didn\u2019t seem like the dancing type, but his movements were slick and effortless. Facing one another, they joined hands. Arnold wrapped his other arm around her waist. \nOoh. His hand felt huge against her back. She realized she was breathing a little faster. They\u2019d never been this close before.\nNo, that isn\u2019t quite true. This is the second time. Rishe\u2019s final memories from her last life flashed vividly through her mind.\nThis was indeed the second time they had been this close\u2014the first had ended with a sword through her chest.\nEmperor Arnold Hein had single-handedly decimated the knights in the castle. Rishe stood in the midst of the carnage, breath ragged as she gripped the hilt of her sword, slick with her own blood. She was the last line of defense. The chamber behind her housed the royal family.\nIf they could reach the hidden passageways, the young prince and his party could find shelter with their allies across the border. Rishe and the other knights were prepared to sacrifice their lives to allow the royal family to survive. Their escape meant victory.\nBells tolled out, urging flight. All is lost. Run. Rishe managed to graze Arnold\u2019s cheek with her blade before she looked down to find his jet-black sword blooming out of her chest.\nShe remembered how it burned, as if the blade was made of fire. It was heat, not pain, but her breathing grew labored, and when Emperor Arnold Hein withdrew his sword, Rishe crumpled. \nHe knelt by her side and whispered something.\nThe words were seared into her memory. Rishe squeezed Arnold\u2019s hand as they danced.\nI\u2019ll be the bully this time. \nRishe shifted her weight back, slipping out of the hold on her waist. She broke Arnold\u2019s lead and spun, drifting on the harmony of the dance. She took him by surprise; his eyes went wide.\nI wonder what you\u2019ll do when you\u2019re no longer on top, Your Highness. Her smile was a declaration of war. Watching him attempt to follow her lead would be delightful. She pulled his hand toward her, attempting to move them into a spin.\nBut Arnold held fast. He planted his hand on her waist and turned them in a different direction, using her inertia against her. Hey! As a result, Rishe twirled by herself on the spot.\nShe didn\u2019t miss a step. She turned elegantly, the hem of her dress whispering across the ballroom floor. She heard appreciative murmurs from the wallflowers lined up watching.\nDespite that, Rishe took it as a defeat. Round one to Arnold. \nSo\u2026you can think on your feet. How about this?\nArnold remained unruffled, evading her next scheme like it was nothing. He grinned down at her, his eyes shining with a dare.\nHe thinks I can\u2019t beat him. His ease vexed her, but it was his smugness that made her angry.\nShe let out a hard breath, attempting a maneuver to lure him in while turning. He leaned back, not falling for it at all.\nHe\u2019s just too good at changing his center of gravity! She kept her astonishment under wraps, but she felt it. Despite how close we\u2019re dancing, I can\u2019t throw off his timing at all. He\u2019s sidestepped all my attempts, and he takes back the lead the second I let down my guard!\nIt made her increasingly angry. She twirled and stepped as the dance dictated, all the while feeling out for moments of weakness. Arnold played along with her game, completely unruffled.\nEvery single time. I\u2019m doing my utmost to trip him up, but he doesn\u2019t even seem annoyed! At this point she\u2019d just settle for any reaction at all.\nTheir unusual dance style had gathered a crowd. Rishe paid them no mind, focused only on her goal. Then something occurred to her, and her breath caught in her throat.\nWait a minute, he has left an opening. It\u2019s the same one from before. She thought back to their fight to the death, to that moment when she had managed to draw blood. That may indeed have been his only weakness.\nIf I strike the same way\u2014huh? Before she could try, Arnold appeared to lose patience, wrapping his arm around her waist. He bent her back into a dip so deep it felt like he\u2019d pulled a carpet from under her feet. She yelped, grabbing at him reflexively, clinging tight. His big hands gripped her securely enough to mitigate the sensation of falling. Relief flooded through her, and she felt a laugh rumble against her ear.\nThe music came to an end with one last ringing note. She blinked. The dance is over?\nA hush fell over the ballroom. Then cheers broke out, followed by a round of applause.\n\u201cThat was incredible!\u201d\nThe watching nobles crowded in.\n\u201cYou two moved in such perfect harmony!\u201d\n\u201cI was on the edge of my seat. I felt like I was watching a sword duel!\u201d\n\u201cIs this a dance from Hermity? I\u2019ve never seen such steps before.\u201d\n\u201cUh, well\u2026\u201d Rishe floundered. She glanced up at Arnold, who appeared to be enjoying her struggle. She\u2019d get no help from him.\nRishe dealt with the barrage of questions as best she could, letting the crowd sweep them into the dining room, which was set up for a buffet-style meal. She made sure to greet every guest, riveting their faces into her memory.\nShe must have been acting peculiar, because Arnold eventually said, \u201cRishe, I think the wine is getting to you. Shall we get some fresh air?\u201d\nRishe hadn\u2019t touched a single drop. In fact, she\u2019d been caught up in so many conversations that she hadn\u2019t even had the chance to eat, but she had experience working on an empty stomach. She accepted Arnold\u2019s encouragement as the escape it was.\nJust when I least expect it, he\u2019ll act the gentleman. Maybe he\u2019d remembered her demand for a carefree life of doing nothing.\nRishe cast a charming look across the crowd. \u201cThank you for your consideration, Your Highness. Forgive me.\u201d She gave a polite bow before quietly slipping away. \nShe didn\u2019t head straight to the balcony but rather slowly walked around the hall. There was only so much she could find out glued to Arnold\u2019s side all night.\nI need information. Galkhein\u2019s political landscape was a mystery to me through all my past lives. I only know the rumors that made it abroad.\nAlthough she knew of Arnold\u2019s eventual patricide, she had no concept of the circumstances leading up to it. She needed a better picture of the factions and power balance inside the court. The lives these people led.\nI know better than to believe wartime gossip. This Arnold Hein is a lot different from what I\u2019d heard he was like at nineteen. He\u2019s not as diabolical as the rumors led me to believe. He likes to push, but he isn\u2019t unkind. The thought drifted across her mind, leaving her conflicted. Well, he\u2019s not unkind now. But I still don\u2019t like not knowing his motives. And he\u2019s a bit of a jerk, to be honest. \nShe tried to settle her mind and just observe. Gathering intelligence was necessary to lead a long, carefree life lazing around the palace.\nIf I recall correctly, that\u2019s Lord Hannawald. He seems to be on good terms with Count Gayle. Duke Hudemann and Duke Teinitz are having a friendly enough conversation, yet they don\u2019t seem close. Rishe ticked off the names of people she\u2019d met, committing them to memory.\nA wave of sweet perfume wafted over her. A pretty girl with soft blonde hair had appeared at her side. \u201cHow do you do, Lady Rishe? I\u2019m Cornelia Thea Toona.\u201d\nDuke Toona\u2019s family was the thirty-first house she\u2019d met tonight.\nRishe smiled graciously. \u201cRishe Irmgard Weitzner. A pleasure to meet you.\u201d\n\u201cThe pleasure is all mine.\u201d Cornelia smiled sweetly. Her eyes were big and bright, her lips full. She held a glass in each hand and offered one to Rishe. \u201cWine? I see you\u2019re empty-handed.\u201d\nA gaggle of other ladies nearby began giggling among themselves.\n\u201cHow dare she act so haughty when she\u2019s a captive. It\u2019s time for her learn just what she is. A pawn to be played and discarded.\u201d\n\u201cShe should enjoy her time on Prince Arnold\u2019s arm while she can.\u201d\n\u201cShe is from a minor nation, after all.\u201d\nAs Rishe took note of their whispers, Cornelia gazed at her with doe eyes. \u201cDoes my offering offend you in some way?\u201d\nIf I remember correctly, House Toona holds a vast territory in southern Galkhein.\nRishe held out a hand to accept the glass. \u201cHow could it? Thank you, Lady Cornelia.\u201d\nBefore Rishe could touch the glass, Cornelia gave a dramatic shout. \u201cOh dear! My hand slipped!\u201d She dropped it, quite obviously on purpose. Without thinking, Rishe grabbed her skirts and leaned back, plucking the glass out of the air with the other hand.\nCornelia let out a cry of surprise as Rishe caught the wine before any could spill. She swirled the glass and brought it to her nose to breathe in the bouquet.\nHmm\u2026 That\u2019s mashed capsicum. Where did she even get that? What a waste of perfectly good wine. And why bother spicing it enough to singe the tongue if she just planned to ruin my dress? Pick a plan, my dear.\nHiding her exasperation, Rishe smiled brightly. \u201cI\u2019ve never had a wine quite like this. What an unusual scent.\u201d\nCornelia bit her lip in frustration. Rishe beamed at her. You\u2019ve got such a pretty face, Lady Toona. Why don\u2019t you smile?\nRishe leaned in close to Cornelia. \u201cThis vintage isn\u2019t available where I\u2019m from. I\u2019m ever so anxious to learn more. Should I perhaps invite Prince Arnold over to enjoy a glass? Which tray did you get this from?\u201d\n\u201cWhat? Oh, um\u2026\u201d Rishe had a policy of never backing down from a fight, but it seemed Cornelia didn\u2019t share it. \u201cS-sorry, but I don\u2019t remember. Such a large hall, you see.\u201d\n\u201cA shame. I\u2019ll just give His Highness this one, then. I\u2019ll be sure to let him know who it\u2019s from.\u201d\n\u201cUh, wait!\u201d",
    "query_text": " Cornelia rapidly shook her head. \u201cI-I got that glass for you, so I think you should\u2014you know what? Never mind! Maybe I should just take that\u2014oh no!\u201d\nRishe ignored the ashen-faced Cornelia, raising the glass and swallowing down a gulp. \n\u201cI-I can\u2019t believe\u2026\u201d\n\u201cSuch a spicy flavor, just as I imagined.\u201d Rishe smiled again to the assembled group\u2019s astonishment. \u201cWhat a warm welcome. I do hope the two of us can spend more time"

Rishe cast her eyes down as she ruminated. The most obvious beneficiaries of a dead crown prince would be potential heirs and those loyal to them. I believe Arnold has a younger brother, but I haven\u2019t met him yet.\nOdd. Rishe might be a hostage, but shouldn\u2019t she meet her future relatives? Perhaps it was Arnold\u2019s doing and not the will of the imperial family themselves. He didn\u2019t seem to want to involve her in anything unless it was absolutely necessary\u2014he hadn\u2019t told her about this ball, after all. \nRishe looked up at him. \u201cYour Highness, may I select my maids some time over the next few days?\u201d \n\u201cVery well. I\u2019ll tell Oliver to make that a priority.\u201d\n\u201cAh, I can do the selection myself. We needn\u2019t trouble him.\u201d\nArnold arched an amused brow. Gone was that unsettling smile, replaced with his easy manner. \u201cWhat are you planning this time?\u201d\n\u201cOh, nothing important,\u201d Rishe said. She picked up her empty glass. \u201cI\u2019m merely concerned about the servants\u2019 working conditions.\u201d\nTo protect her life and well-being, she needed to keep from dying at twenty years old again. And to do that, she had to prevent Arnold Hein\u2019s war. Her best bet would be to appeal to the important people she\u2019d known in her past lives. People with influence.\nPlus, there was a mountain of things she needed to do in preparation for the marriage ceremony.\nI need to sow a plot of land, grow herbs, do lots of shopping, get cheap alcohol, and then\u2026 \nRishe began a to-do list that had nothing to do with war in the least.\n \n***\n \nAs the ball wound to a close, a lone boy stood in the gloomy courtyard of the imperial palace. He had soft black hair and round blue eyes. No older than sixteen, he had an androgynous grace to him, gaze fixed on the balcony above. \nHe was watching a girl.\nShe had coral-colored hair, and even from this distance, he could tell she was beautiful. She stood there alone, apparently waiting for someone. Whoever it was must have shown up because her hand slipped from the banister, and she stepped away. Not too long after, a man appeared where she had been standing.\nThe man turned a silent glare down into the garden, as if he\u2019d known the boy had been there the whole time, despite the shadows.\nA shiver ran down the boy\u2019s spine and he smiled reflexively, delighting in the intense aura of threat the man gave off. It was just a warning, it seemed, as the man abruptly turned on his heel and disappeared. \n\u201cAww, we can\u2019t play together either?\u201d The boy hung his head. \u201cI miss you, Brother.\u201d\nIt had to be the woman. The beauty. She\u2019d made the boy\u2019s life hell since the day she arrived. \nHis brother had prohibited him from attending balls like this one. That was fine; he\u2019d sooner avoid them altogether. Still, he\u2019d wanted to meet that girl. \n\u201cBut we\u2019ll meet soon enough, won\u2019t we?\u201d He spoke to himself in a soft voice. \u201cI\u2019ve got plans for you, Sister.\u201d \n\n(2) chapter number given is likely out of range: 0\nChapter: 8\n\nChapter 3\nChapter 3\n \n\u201cYOU\u2019RE ALL SO USELESS!\u201d Diana the redheaded maid\u2019s voice rang out inside the stone washhouse. \nThree days had passed since the afternoon Rishe shook off her guard and came out to the well. Rishe was once again dressed to fit in with the maids. At Diana\u2019s shout, she looked up without pausing in her work. \n\u201cIs even laundry beyond your capabilities? I asked you to wash these this morning, and now it\u2019s past noon! Meanwhile, we\u2019ve finished cleaning the entire first floor in a third of the time!\u201d\n\u201cI-I\u2019m sorry, Diana.\u201d\nThe new maids went silent with shame. Among them was Elsie, the girl Rishe stood up for the other day. Rishe pulled her hands out of the soapy water, gently rinsed them, and said, \u201cLet me help. What still needs to be done?\u201d\n\u201cYou again?\u201d Diana rounded on Rishe. \u201cI don\u2019t know who you serve, but I\u2019m amazed you have the time to do other people\u2019s work. I wish I had so much free time.\u201d\nHuffily, she turned from Rishe. \u201cLet\u2019s just ignore these useless fools. Laura, Maya. Come on. If we want to be chosen as Lady Rishe\u2019s maids, we mustn\u2019t waste our time.\u201d\nDiana took out a slip of paper from her pocket, smoothing it out. \u201cIt looks like the new bedsheets for her palace will arrive today. We should inspect them to make sure everything is perfect!\u201d\n\u201cWait up, Diana!\u201d\nThe two maids followed Diana out. Rishe waited for the door to close before turning to Elsie and the others. \u201cLet\u2019s keep working. If there\u2019s anything too large and cumbersome, feel free to pass it over to me.\u201d\n\u201cTh-thank you so much!\u201d The new maids went weak with gratitude. One of them, a girl on the verge of tears, even fell into a full bow. Rishe muttered encouragement as she scrubbed some bedsheets.\nElsie, who was washing the sheets with her, wore a rueful look. \u201cI\u2019m so sorry for the trouble. We\u2019re just not learning fast enough.\u201d\n\u201cYou haven\u2019t been working here long, have you? It takes time to learn a new job, no matter who you are,\u201d Rishe said as she kept scrubbing. \u201cAnd it\u2019s not like you\u2019ve never washed a single thing in your life before, right?\u201d\nElsie nodded nervously. \nRishe had realized over the past few days doing the laundry that not all the newcomers were complete amateurs. They\u2019d obviously done chores at home, or something similar. When set a specific task, they could perform it properly, but Diana\u2019s complaints weren\u2019t unfounded. They did take far too much time with laundry.\nBut it\u2019s obvious why. \u201cDo you know anything about Diana?\u201d Rishe asked Elsie. \u201cLike, is she from a well-off family?\u201d\nElsie said, \u201cI heard that her father was a business owner. She worked with him.\u201d\n\u201cI heard that as well,\u201d added another maid. \u201cBut he fell into debt and had to sell off.\u201d \nRishe stopped scrubbing for a moment to consider this.\n\u201cUm, is something the matter?\u201d Elsie asked.\nRishe smiled and shook her head. \u201cNo, nothing. Let\u2019s just focus on getting these washed for the time being.\u201d\n \n***\n \nThat afternoon, thirty maids were assembled in the detached wing of the palace. Ten of them were old hands, long in service to the royal family, while the other twenty were freshly hired. The crown princess was to choose her maids from among these thirty. They wore their nerves plainly on their sleeves. \n\u201cHey, I thought this palace was in a terrible state of neglect,\u201d one maid whispered. \u201cWhy is it so sparkling clean?\u201d\n\u201cYeah, you\u2019re right,\u201d said another. \u201cSomeone must have sorted it out before we arrived.\u201d\n\u201cI wonder what kind of person Lady Rishe is. Ooh, I\u2019m so nervous.\u201d\nThe girls looked around anxiously.\n\u201cHey, Elsie, that girl who was always helping us isn\u2019t here.\u201d\nElsie blinked. \u201cYou\u2019re right.\u201d\n\u201cLook, Diana. That impertinent newbie didn\u2019t get picked.\u201d \nAt her friend\u2019s observation, Diana preened with satisfaction. \u201cNo surprise there. You need some manners to attend to Lady Rishe. I bet she got kicked out of the running!\u201d Her eyes sparkled with confidence.\nAt last, there was a knock at the door.\n\u201cHer Royal Highness, Princess Rishe.\u201d\nThe maids quickly fell into bows. Diana\u2019s chest ached with anticipation as heels clicked on the floor, approaching the line of girls. From the corner of their eyes, the maids saw a wide-skirted court dress. A gentle scent washed over them.\nWithout even looking at her, they could tell Crown Princess Rishe was a lovely woman. Diana and her friends swelled with pride that she was to become their mistress.\nBut then Laura whispered to Diana, \u201cHey, isn\u2019t this scent familiar?\u201d\n\u201cQuiet!\u201d Clearly it was some sort of expensive perfume. Or so Diana thought, but then she realized what it was. The words just slipped out. \u201cIt\u2019s soap.\u201d\n\u201cHuh? Did you just say something?\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s soap. The same kind we always use.\u201d Diana was sure of it.\nThe princess said, \u201cPlease rise.\u201d \nWhy did her voice sound so familiar? An incredible foreboding gripping her, Diana looked up. She gasped.\n\u201cMy name is Rishe Irmgard Weitzner.\u201d\nBefore her stood the beautiful newcomer\u2014the thorn in her side for the past few days. The smile she wore was peaceful and just the slightest bit satisfied.\n \n***\n \nI\u2019m so glad I managed to finish washing the sheets in time!\nStanding before the maids with Arnold\u2019s attendant Oliver at her side, Rishe was panicking on the inside. She\u2019d had so much to do this morning that she\u2019d put off the laundry to the last minute. She took deep, controlled breaths, praying no one would notice that she\u2019d raced here at a dead sprint.\nOliver was none the wiser as he spoke to the assembled girls. Rishe took the opportunity to look them over. She locked eyes with Elsie, who was gaping at her. It was a nice change\u2014usually her face was as blank as a rock wall.\nI\u2019m sorry for the deception. I figured blending in would give me the best picture of your working conditions.\nThe new maids wore similarly shocked expressions, while others watched her with delight. Meanwhile, the veterans, including Diana, had all gone pale. They trembled, stunned into silence. One seemed locked in a terrifying trance, while another looked on the verge of tears. All of them had spoken to Rishe with derision. As the ringleader, Diana was covering her mouth with both hands, like she was holding in a scream.\nOliver had finished his introduction. \u201cYour Highness, if you would?\u201d\nRishe stepped forward. \u201cFirst, I must apologize to you for what has transpired prior to this meeting. My deception, that is. However, it has granted me insight into how each one of you works.\u201d\nOliver\u2019s face creased in confusion. The newcomer maids began to panic, whispering among themselves.\n\u201cDoesn\u2019t this mean that she helped us out with the laundry?\u201d\n\u201cWe\u2019re going to be fired!\u201d\n\u201cIf I lose my position, my brother will have to quit school!\u201d\nNoticing the commotion, Oliver glanced at Rishe. \u201cYour Highness, two-thirds of these maids are newly recruited from the city. Since the majority of the castle maids were elderly, His Highness assumed you would prefer maids closer in age to yourself.\u201d\nRishe was startled. She had found it odd that most of her potential servants were new hires, but she hadn\u2019t expected this to be the reason.\n\u201cWhile the prince has entrusted the selection of your maids to you,\u201d Oliver went on. \u201cHiring someone with no experience will not do. Despite Prince Arnold\u2019s views, I urge you to reject the newcomers.\u201d\n\u201cOliver.\u201d\n\u201cI have a list of their names here. Elsie\u2014\u201d\n\u201cElsie, Nichole, Hilde, Marguerite, Rosa.\u201d Rishe began listing the names of the newly recruited maids. She\u2019d made a point to memorize them in the washhouse. \u201cElke, Amelia, and\u2014\u201d\nOliver looked at her wildly. \u201cYou know them all?! Even though they\u2019ve never served you in the past?\u201d\n\u201cYes, of course I do. Servants are essential to the maintenance of our lifestyle, why wouldn\u2019t I get to know them?\u201d Rishe listed the remaining names for good measure. \u201cAll twenty of you, listen to me.\u201d \nThe new maids stiffened. Diana and the other maids whose names hadn\u2019t been called were getting their wind back, wearing increasingly triumphant looks.\nRishe said, \u201cThe twenty names I just called will be my maids.\u201d\nTime seemed to stand still a moment, and then Oliver broke in with an astonished, \u201cB-but, my lady! They are all inexperienced\u2014\u201d\n\u201cYes. And my palace will be the perfect place to learn.\u201d\nThe new recruits were completely speechless, unsure of exactly what was happening. \nRishe smiled at Elsie. \u201cI hope you\u2019ll serve me well, Elsie.\u201d\nElsie was still frozen in place. \u201cHuh? Y-yes, my lady, but\u2014\u201d\nA shaking Diana cried out, \u201cBut why, my lady?! You\u2019ve seen their work! They\u2019re useless, the lot of them! The rest of us get so much more done in a shorter amount of time!\u201d\n\u201cWatch your tongue, girl,\u201d Oliver said sharply.\nDiana ignored him. \u201cWe\u2019re hard workers! Any job you assign us, we can do it! Please, I beg you, my lady!\u201d\n\u201cStep back,\u201d Oliver warned. \u201cDo not take a single step closer to Lady Rishe.\u201d\nDiana spoke in a rush, words pouring out of her. \u201cI-I freely admit that I was impolite before, but I didn\u2019t know who she was! I\u2019ll take any punishment, so please, give me the chance to show you how well I can work!\u201d\nRishe said, \u201cDiana, I have a request.\u201d\n\u201cTh-thank you, my lady!\u201d Diana heaved a sigh of relief. \u201cYou mean you\u2019ll\u2014\u201d \nRishe cut across her. \u201cAs of today, you are no longer a maid in this palace.\u201d \n\u201cWhat?\u201d Her face, usually so fixed with determination, paled. \u201cBut why? I\u2019m so much better than any of them! I\u2019ll do a perfect job no matter what task you set before me. Please don\u2019t dismiss me, my lady!\u201d \n\u201cListen to me, Diana.\u201d Rishe dropped her lofty tone, speaking as one woman would to another. \u201cYou have noticed it, haven\u2019t you? No matter what you claim, these new girls aren\u2019t worthless.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2026I don\u2019t understand.\u201d\n\u201cCan you remember your first month in service? How difficult it was?\u201d\nDiana looked completely bewildered. Her gaze darted around as if looking for help.\nPulling herself together, she forced herself to follow Rishe\u2019s directions. She thought back and finally alighted on a response. \u201cI\u2026I didn\u2019t know how to do the job. Before, when my family was still prominent, I\u2019d washed shirts and bedsheets. Never gowns or military uniforms.\u201d\n\u201cPerfectly reasonable,\u201d Rishe said. \u201cOnly natural for someone just starting out.\u201d\n\u201cThe older girls were so busy, they told me to just watch them since they didn\u2019t have time to teach me. When I had questions\u2026well, there was nobody to ask.\u201d\n\u201cI bet. And did you have any other problems?\u201d\n\u201cWell, yes. There was a lot to learn. Different kinds of soap and washboards depending on the cloth. You use different tools for different materials. I had to learn how they worked and how to put them away. I was\u2026punished if I didn\u2019t get it right the first time.\u201d\nThe newcomers were exchanging surprised looks. Rishe understood why.\nEverything Diana said was familiar to them. They spent valuable time searching for their materials and the proper ways to use them, but they shrank from asking for help. Everyone always looked so busy. This was a universal problem.\n\u201cDespite all that, I got better!\u201d Diana protested. \u201cI only needed to be taught once. Unlike them! They\u2019re useless!\u201d\n\u201cYes, well. There\u2019s a difference between you and them,\u201d Rishe told Diana. \u201cYou can read and write.\u201d\n\u201cOh!\u201d Diana started in surprise. Elsie looked at the floor.\nThe literacy rate among commoners was low no matter where you went. Very few families had the means to afford an education, especially for daughters. Diana had been born to a merchant\u2019s family\u2014she\u2019d received formal schooling. The maids she was close friends with were likely from similar backgrounds. The majority of those in service were not so fortunate.\n\u201cWhat if you only received instructions on how to do a job once and weren\u2019t able to write it down to remind yourself later?\u201d Rishe asked. \u201cWould you be so confident?\u201d\n\u201cI-I don\u2019t\u2014\u201d Diana reflexively thrust a hand into her apron pocket, where she had a list of daily tasks recorded in her neat handwriting to reference throughout the day. Hopefully now she would understand how much of an edge her privileged literacy gave her over the other maids.\n\u201cEveryone else works as hard as they can, just like you do,\u201d Rishe said. \u201cRemember how it was for you at first? They all have to start somewhere. I hope you\u2019ll keep that in mind.\u201d\n\u201cThey\u2019re no different from me,\u201d Diana mumbled begrudgingly, glancing around the room, looking at the less experienced",
    "query_text": " maids. As if coming to a decision, she said, \u201cI\u2019m sorry.\u201d\n\u201cDiana?\u201d\nLike a child enumerating her regrets, Diana went on, \u201cI\u2019ve done you wrong, all of you. It\u2019s just, I had nothing. Or so it felt like. No money, no title. I thought I had to make my way in the world on my own. That I had to start from zero.\u201d Her shoulders trembled as she buried her face in her hands. \u201cBut I was wrong! I wasn\u2019t starting from zero. I had everything that I learned growing up. I didn\u2019t realize how fortunate I was. I let it all go to my he\n \n\u201cR"

That\u2019s what you\u2019d want to do over?!\u201d\nWhen she arrived back at home on the night of her second life, Rishe grabbed her jewelry box and as many of the books her late grandmother had left her as she could carry, then made haste to the forest to meet the caravan. But the stop at her house took time, and she missed them completely.\nIn that moment, Rishe made a stark realization. Different choices meant different mistakes. Opening one door would close another.\nAnd so the easy path to a life in commerce was closed to her.\nSure, she could try to build her business from the ground up, but personal connections were almost as essential to being a merchant as business savvy. It just wasn\u2019t realistic without a single acquaintance. \nSorting through her belongings in resignation, she came across a foreign encyclopedia of herbs among her grandmother\u2019s books. Taking it as a sign, Rishe sold her jewels elsewhere and used the funds to cross the sea and pursue the study of medicine.\nFortunately, Rishe retained all her knowledge from her previous life. She remembered that certain expensive herbs could be acquired cheaply in other regions. When word spread of a disease running rampant in a neighboring country, she recalled that too. This foreknowledge proved invaluable, as did her wide travel and exposure to many different teachers with many different points of view.\nAs such, Rishe led a successful life as an apothecary. She saved a feeble prince, synthesized a number of rare medicines with her mercantile knowledge, and thus spent her days in the simple joy of helping those in need.\nUnfortunately, all the joy in the world couldn\u2019t stand up to an epidemic. Thus ended her second life. \nOnce again, she found herself in the moment of her broken engagement, the curtain rising on the third loop. Her next four lives proceeded much the same way. As a skilled lady\u2019s maid, she helped a young noblewoman to a fortuitous marriage. Once, she even disguised herself as a man and became a knight. Every life was worth living, and she enjoyed them all. She enjoyed living, period.\nThere was just one problem.\nNo matter what I do, I die at twenty.\nShe enjoyed her lives, but she was not permitted to do so for long. With this time limit always hanging over her, she spent each loop in a state of constant activity.\nI would love to take it easy for a while. Is a little leisure time too much to ask? Obviously I don\u2019t want to die either! This time, I\u2019ll make as much money as I can in the first five years. Then, when I turn twenty, I\u2019ll live a life free of worldly cares. I\u2019ll do whatever\u2019s necessary to stay alive!\nHer mind made up, Rishe began her seventh life in a dead sprint through the palace. Regardless of her future plans, she was in a race against time. She needed to beat the messenger bearing news of her scandal.\nAs she ran, she yanked off her hair ornaments; she planned to sell them and didn\u2019t want to risk losing one. Her hair billowed out behind her, falling in loose waves.\nSuddenly, an idea occurred to her, one she hadn\u2019t had in any of her previous six lives.\nLeaving through the palace gardens would be faster. I can climb down a tree from the balcony.\nRishe had gone to war as a knight in the life just before this one. After the punishing battlefield training, climbing trees was nothing.\nSeamlessly, she changed direction. She raced for the balcony, where she ran into something at full speed.\n\u201cBwargh!\u201d Rishe let out a very unladylike grunt, staggering a few steps. She looked up to see what she\u2019d bounced off of. \u201cOh\u2026\u201d\nAn exceptionally handsome man stood in her path.\nHe had refined, patrician features and cruel, thin lips. He was slender yet powerful; even through his clothes, Rishe could tell his body was well conditioned. His jet-black hair covered his ears, creeping down to the nape of his neck. The tips of his locks bounced with his movements. They looked to be soft to the touch.\nFrom head to toe, he was a pleasure to look at\u2014but what held Rishe\u2019s attention were his eyes. They were long in shape and impossibly blue, but they possessed a blade-sharp intensity. His gaze was clear, beautiful, and cold as ice. His eyelashes cast shadows on his striking face. He was a work of art.\nCurrently, this work of art was staring her down with a look that could kill.\nHe laughed. \u201cYou barreled right into me. For a moment, I thought I\u2019d been attacked by a wild boar.\u201d\nIt was an exceedingly rude thing to say to a stranger, but as luck would have it, this man was not a stranger. At least not to Rishe.\n\u201cWhat are you even doing here?\u201d the man went on. \u201cThe party is in the\u2014\u201d\nRishe interrupted him with a wordless shout of dismay. The man drew back, reflexively reaching for his sword. He composed himself with visible difficulty. \u201cWho are you? You look like any noblewoman, but your manner is\u2026\u201d \n\u201cEmperor Arnold Hein!\u201d \nThe man\u2019s eyes widened. He didn\u2019t mistake her surging contempt. Rishe had crossed swords with this man. Recently. He was the one responsible for ending her sixth life. \nHe must be a guest at the banquet. It makes sense.\nArnold Hein was the scion of a military nation not far from Rishe\u2019s home country of Hermity, the one in which they now stood. Their kingdoms, so recently at war, had brokered an ostensible peace, and the two ruling families met from time to time. Crown Prince Dietrich\u2019s engagement party would be one such occasion. He\u2019d gathered elites from far and wide to introduce to his beloved Mary.\nThe man eyed Rishe with rising curiosity. \u201cYou know me? This is my first time in Hermity.\u201d\nUh-oh. Rishe pasted on a smile as her mind spun in circles. This man was dangerous. She had to avoid entanglements with him at all costs. Five years from now, Arnold Hein would invade Hermity. \nHe was an extraordinarily skilled swordsman and, with a powerful military at his back, was destined to conquer kingdom after kingdom. He had done as much in her second, third, fourth, and fifth lives. In her sixth, Rishe had faced him in battle herself and died by his hand.\nWe never had a chance. That war was lost before it began.\nArnold\u2019s brilliance lay not in his swordplay but in his skill as a tactician. He set countries up for conquest and knocked them down, swallowing them one by one.\nI know him, but he doesn\u2019t know me. We haven\u2019t met in this life. I need an",
    "query_text": " excuse fast. \nRishe curtsied slowly. \u201cMy name is Rishe Irmgard Weitzner. We\u2019ve never been introduced, but I\u2019ve heard of you.\u201d\nArnold donned an amused smile. \u201cYou plant your weight like a trained swordswoman. Your center of gravity is perfect.\u201d\n\u201cYou exaggerate,\u201d Rishe demurred. \u201cThat was simply a curtsy to an esteemed guest.\u201d \n\u201cI must have misheard, but I swear you called me \u2018emperor\u2019 just now.\u201d \nRishe froze.\n\u201cMy father yet lives,\u201d Arnold said. \u201cI am simply a crown prince. Why would you call me that?\u201d \n\u201cUh, um\u2026\u201d Rishe floundered for an answer.\nShe\u2019d made such a foolish mistake. Arnold\u2019s gaze cut right"

    "prefix_text": "? Nineteen now? This is so weird. He\u2019s grinning like a boy getting into a scrape.\nThat attack had been good-natured as well, almost playful. It had muscle behind it but certainly not any lethal intent. He\u2019d just wanted to force Rishe to catch the blow. She found it unbelievable that he could exude such an overpowering air of menace when he was just messing around.\nWhile Rishe was focused on Arnold, Mary and Dietrich caught up, seemingly recovered.\n\u201cExcuse me, my lord!\u201d Mary squeaked. \u201cI-I-I don\u2019t know who you are, but kindly step away from Lady Rishe!\u201d\n\u201cYes, do as she says! Who the hell are you, anyway?!\u201d\nDon\u2019t tell me Prince Dietrich doesn\u2019t recognize one of his personal guests.\nDietrich\u2019s interests did not lean toward diplomacy; he likely hadn\u2019t bothered to introduce himself to Arnold. Mary, for her part, seemed to grasp that Arnold wasn\u2019t ordinary. She stood up to defend Rishe, despite the tremble in her voice. In a better world, perhaps the two of them could have become friends.\n\u201cThat\u2019s your ex-fianc\u00e9?\u201d Arnold cocked a brow. \u201cHe\u2019s even worse than I imagined. Pathetic.\u201d\nDietrich flushed. \u201cI\u2019ll have your head!\u201d\n\u201cDietrich, I beg of you, contain yourself,\u201d Rishe said, then rounded on Arnold. \u201cAs for you, Your Highness\u2014you know who Dietrich is, and you know what speaking carelessly could mean. Are you trying to pick a fight?\u201d\n\u201cWhatever do you mean?\u201d Arnold\u2019s brows lifted high, making him the picture of innocence. \u201cBelieve me, Lady Rishe, every word I speak is chosen with extreme care.\u201d\nFinally realizing who Arnold was, Dietrich visibly paled. \u201cArnold? He\u2019s the crown prince of Galkhein?\u201d\nMary yelped. The knights stood down, shamefaced. The gossip-hungry neighbors who\u2019d gathered to witness a scandal play out drew back in fear.\n\u201cHe\u2019s the demon prince? The one who single-handedly destroyed a whole order of enemy knights?\u201d\n\u201cWatch your tongue, fool! Do you want him to do the same to you?\u201d\nThe two nations enjoyed peaceful relations, but Arnold remained the dreaded prince, heir to the throne of a former enemy. Current rumor wasn\u2019t as widespread as it would be in five years, but he was still regarded with distrust.\nThe onlookers stood rooted to the spot, too terrified to flee.\nWell, this has devolved into a full-fledged disaster.\nRishe heaved a frustrated sigh. \u201cPrince Arnold, to what do we owe this honor? Surely a crown prince would not draw his sword for a mere jest.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m here on business,\u201d Arnold said. \u201cBut first, I must beg forgiveness for my rudeness.\u201d\nHuh, what do you know? Once he became emperor, he\u2019d gladly behead any subject who so much as dared speak a word against him.\nI guess at nineteen he still knew how to apologize.\nIf that surprised her, Arnold\u2019s next act completely obliterated her sense of reality. \nWith a flourish, he fell to his knees. \n\u201cHuh?\u201d Is this actually happening? \nHe was a man destined for an imperial crown. A man who would stand at the head of a military powerhouse and spread his rule across continents.\nArnold, known for his frigid pride, knelt to the disgraced daughter of a duke.\nAnd not only that\u2014his head was bowed, looking nothing so much as a knight swearing allegiance to his lady. If it were anyone else, it would be a delightful, pious image. Instead, the assembled looked on in terrified awe.\nNot Rishe, though.\n\u201cWhat are you doing?\u201d she hissed. \u201cGet up!\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m apologizing for my baseless impertinence. Also, I\u2019m asking you\u2026\u201d He trailed off to take Rishe\u2019s hand, tugging her forward so forcefully she staggered. He gazed up at her.\nUgh. He\u2019s so beautiful. No matter how many times she looked at him, it didn\u2019t become any less disarming. Long eyelashes, arched brows, a noble nose. His bright blue eyes reminded her of the drift ice she\u2019d seen in a northern kingdom, gazing out from a ship in one of her past lives. She knew she was dwelling on this to buy time, even as the reality before her sank in.\n\u201c\u2026to become my wife.\u201d\nShe froze, unable to process the words. \u201cWhat?\u201d Rishe glanced around, desperately searching the faces of the crowd. They all seemed as stunned as she felt. She looked down at Arnold again. \u201cYour wife?\u201d \n\u201cYes, that\u2019s right.\u201d\n\u201cYou want me to become your wife?\u201d\n\u201cYes.\u201d\nRishe couldn\u2019t speak. This was truly happening. It was real. It clicked into place in her head, and she let out a strangled grunt.\nWhat is going on? Why is this happening?\nShock lapped at her, fuzzing at the corners of her vision. He wanted to marry her. Arnold wanted to marry Rishe. Her murderer wanted to marry her.\nWhy is he doing this? He must have some ulterior motive, a broader goal. But I have to give him an answer.\nThe onlookers were holding their breath as Rishe said flatly, \u201cI reject your proposal.\u201d\nArnold said nothing.\nShe had to reject him. She was going to live a long, peaceful, carefree life, damn it, and no one would stop her. And yet\u2026\nArnold began to laugh, and the deep, creeping sense of dread inside Rishe only grew. Why does he seem so amused by this?!\n \n***\n \nHer previous life was her sixth. Disguised as a man, Rishe rose as a warrior of an island country she came upon in her travels. It was a conventional yet charming kingdom formed of red brick. After striking up a friendship with a group of knights who didn\u2019t realize she was a woman, Rishe followed their advice and joined them.\nThe training was grueling enough to make her wish she were dead. Back when she had lived as a noble, she\u2019d learned how to wield a sword for basic self-defense, but training as a noble lady had in no way prepared her for this. She drilled relentlessly, barely taking the time to sleep. Just as she became a full-fledged knight, Emperor Arnold\u2019s forces lay siege to the castle.\n \n***\n \nHow could this happen? \nIn her seventh life, Rishe wearily sank into her chair. Across from her sat Arnold, his legs crossed and chin propped up on his hand, watching her lazily.\n\u201cWhat\u2019s the matter?\u201d he asked. \u201cYou seem unhappy.\u201d\n\u201cYou could say that.\u201d Even her voice was grumpy. Still, she couldn\u2019t very well tell him it was because she bore a grudge from a previous life. After the first time her life rewound to that pivotal moment, she\u2019d resolved to keep her loops a secret. \u201cI had plans for my exile. A brand-new life. And now because of you, my parents are involved. Even the king has heard about it!\u201d\nAfter Rishe rejected Arnold, Dietrich had immediately cried out, \u201cTh-the crown prince of Galkhein proposed to Rishe?!\u201d\nHis shrieks were loud enough to attract the attention of the master and mistress of the manor.\nWhen her parents came out, Rishe had protested, \u201cI\u2019m not going to marry him! I\u2019m leaving the country just as Dietrich commanded.\u201d\nNo one listened. Their faces just paled with nervous confusion.\nJust then, a glittering coach arrived. Half-stuck in the mud, the man inside it was forced to trudge over the swampy ground, and so the king of Hermity himself arrived, staggering and dirt-stained. \nHe grabbed hold of his son\u2019s collar, pushing him into a low bow. He then turned to Prince Arnold and said, rather loudly, \u201cYour Highness! Allow me to apologize for my son\u2019s foolishness! You are an esteemed guest all the way from Galkhein! It is unthinkable he would not offer you the courtesy you are due!\u201d\n\u201cYou\u2019re hurting me, Father! My back!\u201d\nThe king then turned to Rishe. \u201cMy lady, allow me to sincerely apologize as both a king and a father. My son\u2019s behavior toward you has been utterly disgraceful. I beg you to please give Prince Arnold\u2019s proposal due consideration. Not only for your own sake but for the sake of your country.\u201d\nThe king bowed to her as deeply as his son had to Arnold, and her parents joined him. Rishe felt dizzy at the sight of this abject debasement in the presence of citizens.\nArnold, who had been watching the proceedings with a detached amusement, sobered and stepped toward the king. \u201cYour Majesty, please rise.\u201d\nWithout the smirk, Arnold\u2019s face immediately reverted to its cold mask. The king didn\u2019t move. Maybe something in Arnold\u2019s voice kept him frozen.\n\u201cSuch a trifle won\u2019t cause discord between our kingdoms,\u201d he went on. \u201cHowever, I would beg a little time to speak with Lady Rishe.\u201d\nLater, Rishe would learn that Arnold\u2019s attendant had spoken to the king\u2019s own gentleman, certain that his words would reach their target. \u201cMy master took such trouble to attend these festivities, and this is the welcome he is offered? I wonder, what will the emperor think when he learns of his son\u2019s slighting at your nation\u2019s hands?\u201d\n\u201cIf you would, Lady Rishe?\u201d The plump king looked to be on the verge of tears.\nRishe had no obligation to accept and no desire to spend a moment longer in this country than was absolutely necessary. But acquiescence seemed the fastest way to move things along.\nAs her mind whirled, Arnold leaned in to whisper, \u201cIf you refuse to hear my suit, you won\u2019t deter me. I\u2019ll simply move on to Plan B.\u201d\nAnd that was how she found herself in one of the palace\u2019s parlors, here to \u201cjust talk\u201d to Prince Arnold. The ball guests were all gone. It was just the two of them.\n\u201cI want to know what you\u2019re planning,\u201d Rishe said flatly.\n\u201cPlanning? Me?\u201d\n\u201cBy asking me to marry you. You don\u2019t know me. A proposal like this wouldn\u2019t come out of the blue.\u201d\nThis man was destined to become an aggressive warmonger over the next few years. He wouldn\u2019t do anything without a dozen motives.\nPrince Arnold just smiled. \u201cI have no plans. I\u2019m simply enamored with you.\u201d\n\u201cEnamored\u2026?\u201d\nThat was the last thing she\u2019d expected him to say. Asking him to elaborate didn\u2019t seem worth the breath\u2014he was obviously lying. As if this ruthless, inhuman creature with ice in his veins could feel even a flicker of affection.\n\u201cWhy refuse me?\u201d Arnold asked. \u201cYour engagement is broken, you\u2019re on the verge of exile, and you have no faction or supporters. At this rate, you\u2019ll",
    "query_text": " be dead within a fortnight. I\u2019d call my offer a stroke of unbelievable fortune.\u201d\n\u201cYou\u2019re not wrong,\u201d Rishe admitted. \u201cOnce upon a time, I would have jumped at your offer.\u201d\nIf it had been made in her first life, for instance. But now Rishe knew better. Her life was only just getting started, and the future held endless possibilities. After the horror of her sixth loop, she yearned for freedom.\nI don\u2019t want to marry him. I won\u2019t be anyone\u2019s captive. Still\u2026\nRishe, more than anyone, knew that the slightest adjustment could enact profound changes on the trajectory of a life. No doubt she\u2019d have many more lives, but this could be the only one where marriage to Arnold would be an option.\nThe dread emperor. The tyrant. The man who will stoke the fires of war. \nRishe knew the gossip, the endless conjecture behind Arnold Hein\u2019s bloody reign, but she"

    "prefix_text": " he was in a mood. Arnold smoothly flicked the blood off his sword, wiping the blade on the bandit\u2019s shirt before sheathing it. The rest of the men on the ground seemed to be unconscious.\nWait, he didn\u2019t kill anyone? Why not? Is it because we haven\u2019t reached Galkhein?\nShe supposed even Arnold knew better than to go around killing the citizens of other countries. Or perhaps he had yet to become the ruthless monster she knew him as.\nArnold seemed to sense her gaze, turning around with a start. Genuine emotion bloomed on his face, worlds away from the blank mask he wore to face down the bandits. \u201cHow did you get out of the coach?\u201d\nRishe shrugged. \u201cIf I tell you, you\u2019ll be able to prevent me from doing it again.\u201d\nArnold snickered. \u201cYou continue to amaze me.\u201d\nHow can you go from ice-cold to suddenly looking like a normal nineteen-year-old? It\u2019s disconcerting. \nRishe fought down her disquiet as a man alighted from a coach and shouted, \u201cYour Highness! Not again!\u201d He was Oliver, one of the prince\u2019s attendants. He had silver hair and was roughly as tall as Arnold.\n\u201cWhat do you think all these knights are for, decoration? Why do you insist on endangering yourself?\u201d\nRishe had only met Oliver briefly a few days ago, but he didn\u2019t appear to be intimidated by Arnold at all. And, well\u2026he\u2019s not wrong.\nShe feared the menace would return to Arnold\u2019s expression, but he just looked annoyed. \u201cI could tell they were prepared to kill. I\u2019d prefer to take the burden on myself than risk multiple injuries so far afield. And we already have casualties.\u201d\nHe was right. Several injured knights leaned listlessly among the trees. Arnold issued orders to those still able-bodied. \u201cFirst squad, see to the wounded. Second squad, arrest these men.\u201d\n\u201cYes, sir!\u201d\nOliver appeared unsatisfied. \u201cYour Highness, that is a weak justification. I\u2019m overjoyed you\u2019re well, but you must consider Lady Rishe. Perhaps next time we run into a team of murderous brigands, you could allow your consort to remain in the coach.\u201d\n\u201cI told her to remain in the coach!\u201d\nRishe quickly averted her gaze, turning her attention to the wounded knights. They didn\u2019t appear badly injured, yet they all seemed exhausted.\n\u201cExcuse me, can I take a look?\u201d Rishe approached the knight acting as a medic. He looked round, startled by her presence.\n\u201cNonsense, my lady. Don\u2019t trouble yourself, you must have had quite a scare.\u201d\nThis was not unreasonable, but the wariness in his eyes made it clear he wanted her nowhere near his comrade. He isn\u2019t just being polite. He truly is on guard. \nBeside them, an injured knight groaned as another helped him up. \u201cWhat\u2019s wrong with you?\u201d the second knight asked the first. \n\u201cI-I feel\u2026numb.\u201d\n\u201cWhat? Damn.\u201d The knight grabbed up one of the fallen bandit\u2019s swords, going pale as he inspected the blade. \u201cYour Highness, look at this. Poison.\u201d\nArnold clicked his tongue. \u201cLocate every laceration and bind them close to the heart. Suck the poison from the wounds.\u201d\nHe mostly got that right, at least. In the meantime, Rishe located the nearest bound bandit and pulled his dagger out of its sheath. Its wet coating gleamed in the sunlight, just as the knight had said.\nThey applied the poison liberally\u2014whatever it is must be cheap and easily bought in bulk.\nShe wafted the smell toward her, bracing for something rancid, but detected nothing. Then she brought it closer to her nose.\nIt smells sweet, like an overripe apple. Shea grass and\u2026bluecap mushrooms. All the knights appear to have the same symptoms, so I won\u2019t have to check every blade.\nRishe stood back up and headed for the coach.\nOliver took a step after her. \u201cYour Highness, Lady Rishe is\u2014\u201d\n\u201cLeave her. She may do as she pleases.\u201d\n\u201cShe\u2019s well trained,\u201d Oliver mused. \u201cBut a battlefield is no place for a young lady. She probably wasn\u2019t prepared for such a dreadful spectacle.\u201d\nRishe ignored the murmurs and focused on her work. There they are. I\u2019ll take these, these, and\u2026\n\u201cThe poison must be a sleeping drug,\u201d she overheard Arnold saying. \u201cHunters use such drugs to weaken larger prey. I doubt this dose is lethal.\u201d\n\u201cBut it certainly is annoying,\u201d replied Oliver. \u201cWe\u2019re still two days out from Galkhein. Lugging a company of sleeping men in armor won\u2019t be pleasant.\u201d\n\u201cWe\u2019ll have to stop somewhere nearby. A hunter\u2019s settlement. Perhaps they will have an antidote\u2014\u201d\n\u201cExcuse me.\u201d Rishe, who\u2019d returned from the carriage, raised a hand. \u201cI have an antidote.\u201d\n\u201cWhat?\u201d\nThe entire company stared at her in awe.\n \n***\n \nAs it turned out, Arnold\u2019s guess was right. \nThis sweet-smelling substance was a hunter\u2019s drug, made from ingredients that were only toxic in their raw form. Heat rendered them harmless. Rishe had encountered this poison several times before, curing a customer afflicted with it during her life as an apothecary.\n\u201cA lethal dose for a grown man would fill a wine glass. They likely got less than a hundredth of that,\u201d Rishe explained to Arnold, not looking up from her work. \u201cStill, the numbness can block their airways with the roots of their tongues. It\u2019s best to lay them on their sides.\u201d\n\u201cYes, I understand the theory and the solution.\u201d Arnold gazed down at Rishe\u2019s hands. \u201cThe part I\u2019m struggling with is why you\u2019re the one telling me this.\u201d\n\u201cWell, I know how to make the antidote,\u201d Rishe said patiently as she muddled the herbs together in the white soup bowl she\u2019d borrowed for her flowers. She crushed them with the back of a spoon before adding another dried flower, crushing that as well, and combining them to form a paste. This process would be easier with a pestle, but she wasn\u2019t about to complain. \u201cThis poison is common\u2014it\u2019s cheap and easy to make, which often means the antidote is simple as well.\u201d\nThe antidote was synthesized, in fact, when hunters witnessed a deer showing no symptoms after eating a certain mushroom. They tested those along with other common herbs the deer ate. Rishe mentally thanked them for their scientific rigor as she added a bit of water, straining it all through a cloth.\nRishe stood up, brandishing the bowl of bright green medicine. \u201cBoiling would make the antidote more potent, but this works in a pinch.\u201d\nThat was when she noticed the astonished stares. Unsure of what social faux paus she\u2019d perpetrated, she looked away. Oliver was completely stunned. Arnold looked thoughtful. It was imperative the knights were treated as soon as possible, but to Rishe\u2019s dismay, no one was moving. \nDo they not trust me? That makes sense. Anyone would be reluctant to use medicine concocted by a complete stranger. But the longer we wait, the harder the poison will become to cure. \nShe needed to dispel their doubts. Rolling up her sleeve, Rishe approached Arnold and drew his sword from its scabbard. \u201cI need to borrow this for a moment, Your Highness.\u201d\n\u201cWhat are you\u2014\u201d\nShe pushed the blade against the soft skin of her inner arm. Blood welled up, along with the sharp sting of pain. Nothing compared to her injuries sustained during her life as a knight, though.\nArnold did not share her nonchalance. \u201cWhat do you think you\u2019re doing?!\u201d\nHe grabbed for her arm. She stepped out of his grasp. Was blood truly so shocking? She didn\u2019t have the time to worry about it. Clutching the overfull bowl, Rishe hurried back to the knights.\n\u201cDon\u2019t worry. This isn\u2019t poison,\u201d Rishe said. She demonstrated as much by drizzling it with a spoon over her own fresh wound. It stung. That meant the ingredients were working.\n\u201cThis is crushed liquori grass, luqua flowers, and carilya nuts. I\u2019ll swallow some if that\u2019s what it takes to prove it\u2019s safe.\u201d It was horribly bitter; she hoped it wouldn\u2019t come to that. \u201cThe paralysis will last for days. Please make up your mind quickly.\u201d\n\u201cMake up our mind?\u201d\n\u201cWill you allow me to cure the poison? Or would you rather drag paralyzed soldiers all the way to Galkhein? I suppose you could waste His Highness\u2019s time searching for a hunter\u2019s settlement to use their antidote.\u201d She smiled serenely. \u201cIt makes no difference to us. Right, Your Highness?\u201d\nIn the end, Rishe applied the antidote.\nThe recovery took a few hours. While they waited, Rishe picked herbs in the same meadow she\u2019d been gazing at with yearning from the carriage. A fortuitous turn of events. She found anti-inflammatory herbs and flowers to ease sour bellies, ingredients for curing headaches, and mushrooms for inducing slumber. She wrapped them all up in a handkerchief.\nIn the meantime, Arnold dispatched a messenger to this region\u2019s lord, making arrangements to deliver the apprehended bandits. After coordinating with Oliver, he drifted over to Rishe.\n\u201cI see your interest in flowers is mercenary, rather than ornamental,\u201d he said, surveying the heaps of herbs gathered on the bank of the pond. He sat down beside her.\nWhen he didn\u2019t say anything more, Rishe went back to work plucking leaves from plants with valuable stems. The leaves had no medicinal effects, but they did make a decent broth. Slumber mushroom spores were a nuisance unless dried; they were spread out beside her in the sun.\nI wonder, would he be annoyed if I attached herbs to the roof of the coach? That would be unusual adornment for a crown prince\u2019s retinue, but it wouldn\u2019t hurt to ask.\nShe realized, quite suddenly, that Arnold was looking at her. At her hands, specifically. He sat cross-legged with his chin propped on his fist, staring absently, like a kid watching a column of ants march by.\nWhat is so fascinating about herbs?\nTheir eyes met. \u201cAm I bothering you?\u201d he asked.\nRishe shook her head slowly. \u201cNot at all. I was just curious what caught your eye.\u201d\n\u201cNothing specific. I was just thinking how very unusual you are.\u201d He was smiling again. \u201cI\u2019m looking forward to how you\u2019ll surprise me next.\u201d\nLike I\u2019m some sort of rare pet he bought to entertain him. She didn\u2019t like that. Nothing she\u2019d done was at all remarkable\u2014normal tasks performed by a normal person.\n\u201cI didn\u2019t make that antidote for your amusement.\u201d\n\u201cI realize that.\u201d The instigating smile faded from his lips. \u201cYou know, those knights you coerced into taking your home-brewed medicine were all born in the slums.\u201d\n\u201cCoerced? That\u2019s hardly the word I\u2019d use.\u201d\n\u201cGalkhein claims to value merit above all else, but in the end, people are judged by where they came from. Despite this, those men fought their way up from nothing.\u201d\nRishe paused in plucking the seeds from a flower and looked up at Arnold.\n\u201cThe men with the worst cases of the paralysis were all newly assigned. They\u2019ve spent weeks training to ensure this mission was a success. That older knight\u2014the one who bowed to you\u2014sustained an injury protecting the rookies. He cares deeply about his men.\u201d\n\u201cYou seem to care about them too,\u201d Rishe commented.\n\u201cI handpicked them for my retinue.\u201d Arnold clambered to his feet, only to fall into a bow. \u201cAnd you kept them safe. You have my deepest gratitude.\u201d\nRishe found herself at a loss for words. Was this Arnold putting on a mask to hide the monster within? Or was this the real him? She remembered the way he\u2019d looked when he held his blade to the bandit\u2019s throat, like a child poised to break a toy he had grown bored of.\n\u201cDon\u2019t mention it,\u201d Rishe said, uncomfortable. \u201cI knew how to do it, so I did.\u201d\nArnold laughed softly. \u201cBe that as it may, I\u2019d still count a noblewoman who can brew remedies from wildflowers by the side of the road a rare find.\u201d\n\u201cEarlier, when you grabbed my wrist\u2026\u201d Rishe steered the subject away from her incongruous knowledge. \u201cYou broke your promise. You said you wouldn\u2019t touch me.\u201d\n\u201cThat was reflex,\u201d Arnold protested. \u201cI thought you were going to hurt yourself.\u201d\nSuch a simple conversation, so casual. It had Rishe feeling",
    "query_text": " positively peculiar.\n\u201cWhy are your knights so wary around me?\u201d she asked. \n\u201cWary? Oh, they were all at the palace when you broke your first engagement. They\u2019re most likely concerned I\u2019m bringing home a villainous jilt who will lead to my ruin. Something silly like that.\u201d\n\u201cI see.\u201d Apparently, being dumped by a prince called into question one\u2019s herbalist abilities.\n\u201cI\u2019m glad you mentioned it,\u201d Arnold went on, \u201cbecause there may be people in Galkhein who will oppose our union. I will do everything in my power to protect you, but you must bring any insults or threats to me right away.\u201d\n\u201cAre there likely to be many?\u201d\n\u201cIn theory, the crown prince may choose his own wife, but the done thing is, of course, to marry a princess. I assume a duke\u2019s daughter would have at least some ties to the royal"

    "prefix_text": "he worked tirelessly, and before long, the chambers where she would spend the night were ready. The knights offered to carry in the bed, which she allowed.\nWhile they brought in furniture, Rishe started cleaning another room. She had run out of clean water, so she quietly slipped out to the well without informing the knights. It wasn\u2019t quite fair to them, but these were the palace grounds. Surely she didn\u2019t need to be chaperoned everywhere.\nBesides, they\u2019re guards in name only. They\u2019re clearly just here to report my movements to Arnold Hein, Rishe reflected as she walked through a courtyard full of flowers, bucket in hand. Iridescent butterflies cavorted playfully around her feet. He doesn\u2019t seem in a hurry to introduce me to the king. Although if I\u2019m just a hostage, that doesn\u2019t surprise me.\nShe hoped she got to meet the current emperor at least once. The future Arnold\u2019s violent conquest only began after he killed the man and made himself emperor, after all.\nI wonder what happened to Arnold Hein after I died in my past life. Did he reign supreme after winning his war? Or did some country manage to put a stop to his conquest? Whatever the case, I absolutely cannot allow him to start a conflict this time. Being the empress of a wartime nation sounds like so much work! The very thought is unacceptable!\nPerhaps they could divorce, but Rishe had a feeling that if Arnold decided to discard her in the middle of a war, she would fail in her mission to make it past the age of twenty. Better to avoid the situation all together.\nWait. When she thought about it, the cause of every single one of Rishe\u2019s deaths was Arnold and his war. I died fighting. I died when Galkhein\u2019s army invaded\u2026\nLooking at her six lives, all of them had ended in more or less the same way.\nRishe found herself crouched on the ground, cradling her head in her hands. Maybe we should get a divorce right now. But it wasn\u2019t in Rishe\u2019s nature to take back her decisions once she\u2019d made them. \nIf I leave, I\u2019ll probably just die in some war-related disaster again. If I can\u2019t live apart from him, I should take this opportunity to learn everything that I can. \nRishe didn\u2019t know the cause of her repeating lives, but there was no guarantee that the loops were infinite. She had to operate under the possibility that this life could be her last. This required some thought, but standing around seething with anxiety wouldn\u2019t help.\nRight now I\u2019ll focus on cleaning. Once the bath is here, I\u2019ll scrub off all the dust and travel exhaustion. And then I can finally relax! \nBrimming with new determination, she stood up and headed for the well. She was forestalled by the sound of jeering giggles. \n\u201cAww, look at the new girl, trying so hard,\u201d said one voice.\n\u201cAll the enthusiasm in the world won\u2019t make a difference,\u201d said another. \u201cWe\u2019re going to be the crown princess\u2019s maids, not you.\u201d\nThe first added, \u201cHey, are you even listening? Stop wasting your time!\u201d\nRishe heard a weak scream, followed by a thump, like a body hitting the ground. She broke into a run, finding a blonde girl sprawled in the dirt, surrounded by four other women.\n\u201cAre you all right?\u201d Rishe hurried over to help the girl up. Her maid\u2019s uniform\u2014a loose navy-blue dress with a white apron\u2014was smeared with mud. The others were dressed identically.\n\u201cWho are you?\u201d one of the girls snapped at Rishe. She had a mop of blazing-red hair. \u201cAnother newbie?\u201d\nAn understandable mistake. Rishe\u2019s dress was simple, free of ornamentation, and her hair was bound back in a ponytail to keep it out of the way. She was dust-streaked, sweaty, and carrying a bucket in her arms.\nTelling them who I am will be more trouble than it\u2019s worth. Her silence only angered the girls more.\n\u201cAre you one of the crown princess\u2019s maids? They\u2019ve been snatching up every new girl. Those pretty hands of yours don\u2019t look like they\u2019ve ever held a broom,\u201d said one of them.\n\u201cUnfortunately for you, we\u2019ve been working here three years, and we\u2019ll be the ones to serve Prince Arnold as the maids of his palace.\u201d\n\u201cCan you stand? Oh, good, it looks like you\u2019re not injured.\u201d Rishe helped the girl up out of the dirt. \n\u201cHey, don\u2019t ignore us!\u201d the redheaded maid shouted. \u201cYou\u2019ve got some nerve. If you want to make it here, you\u2019ll know your place! I doubt the two of you will last a week!\u201d\nRishe didn\u2019t respond, her attention snagging on something else. The redhead was carrying curtains, probably to bring them to the wash. Rishe stared at them so hard the maid began to shift uncomfortably. \u201cWhat\u2019s your problem?\u201d\n\u201cYou should wait to wash those,\u201d Rishe said.\nThe girl glared daggers at her. \u201cExcuse me? Are you telling me it\u2019s too late in the day? You really are an amateur! The light lasts longer in the spring, you know. And it\u2019s hot today. There\u2019ll be plenty of\u2014\u201d \n\u201cIt\u2019s going to rain, is all.\u201d\nThe maids exchanged glances. \u201cHow can you be so sure?\u201d\n\u201cLook at the clouds amassing. The butterflies and the bees are flying low. The moisture in the air will make the drying take longer.\u201d\n\u201cWhat?\u201d\nAnother maid spoke up in a soft voice. \u201cDiana, you were the one who said we should take the initiative to wash the bigger pieces. You said the crown prince would choose us for his household!\u201d\n\u201cStop putting the blame on me! This isn\u2019t my fault.\u201d An indignant flush crept over the redhead\u2019s face. \u201cThere\u2019s no way some upstart can tell what time it\u2019s going to rain! The weather is going to be fantastic all day. Come on, we\u2019re hauling these over to the wash!\u201d\nThe three girls meekly followed Diana.\nRishe sighed, turning to the blonde girl. \u201cAre you hurt?\u201d\n\u201cNo, I\u2019m fine.\u201d The girl\u2019s gaze darted around nervously. \u201cI\u2019m Elsie. Thank you for helping me.\u201d Her face was studiously blank, but from the way she struggled with her words, Rishe could tell she was being genuine.\n\u201cDon\u2019t worry about it,\u201d Rishe said. \u201cYour uniform seems to have fared less well.\u201d\n\u201cOh no.\u201d Elsie looked down at herself. Her face remained vacant, but she seemed sad. \u201cAnd I just got it.\u201d \n\u201cYou can get the dirt out if you wash it straight away. It\u2019s going to rain, but this dress should dry quickly. Use lots of soap, but don\u2019t scrub it by hand\u2014scrape the mud off with a brush.\u201d\n\u201cWhy a brush?\u201d\n\u201cBecause your fingers will just grind dirt into the threads. A brush is more porous.\u201d\nThe young sons of the family Rishe served spent their time tumbling in the dirt, and she had plenty of experience scraping mud out of clothes. She could even salvage dirty socks that had spent days crumpled in the corner.\n\u201cDo you\u2026 Are you\u2026\u201d Elsie trailed off, blinking rapidly a couple of times before finally looking Rishe in the eyes. \u201cAre you the crown princess\u2019s maid?\u201d\nUnsure how to answer, Rishe couldn\u2019t meet her eyes.\n \n***\n \nAfter parting ways with Elsie, Rishe returned to the detached wing with her fresh water. She put clean sheets on the bed the knights had installed, satisfied that she had a comfortable place to sleep. This room also had the highest-up balcony in the whole detached palace.\nTaking a break, she wandered out onto the balcony and looked off over the capital, the golden afternoon tinged with the onset of twilight. The day was fresh with a recent rain, the air clear enough to see for miles. The spring breeze felt good against her skin, sweaty from cleaning. Rishe leaned against the railing, leaning her head back and closing her eyes.\nShe felt like collapsing into bed immediately, but she desperately needed a wash. Still, she didn\u2019t want to pull herself away from the view and the breeze just yet. When she resumed gazing out absentmindedly, something her mother once said drifted back to her. \n\u201cRishe, there is no need for you to think for yourself.\u201d\nShe frowned, the memories coming thick and fast now.\n\u201cYou mustn\u2019t forget that the duty of our family is to live our lives fully devoted to the kings of the land. You\u2019re smart, but all the thinking in the world won\u2019t do a woman any good. You need only concern yourself with how best to serve the crown prince.\u201d\n\u201cStudies? Focus on social etiquette\u2014that\u2019s what you need for navigating high society. The crown prince\u2019s bride must be flawless. Your smile is lacking. You must always strive to appear amiable.\u201d\nRishe breathed out a long sigh. When I was fifteen, their lectures were the only thing I thought about.\nHer parents preached constantly. \u201cA woman\u2019s true happiness is to marry a suitable man and give birth to his heirs.\u201d\n\u201cBut, Mother\u2026\u201d\nObjection was not permitted. Any argument was immediately dispensed with. As a woman, Rishe could not inherit her father\u2019s title. Her only value was in her marriage. \nDespite knowing now that the opinions of others were as worthless as empty titles, the words still echoed in her memories.\nRishe\u2019s fingertips twitched, and she opened her eyes. Unmoving, she said, \u201cShouldn\u2019t you be seeing to your duties?\u201d\n\u201cMore hidden depths, I see,\u201d came a voice tinged with pleasure. Rishe straightened and turned. There was Arnold, leaning against the door to the balcony. \u201cYou seem able to sense my approach no matter how far or how hard I try.\u201d\n\u201cYou\u2019re quite naughty, aren\u2019t you? You\u2019ve been making your presence known little by little, emanating threat, to see how quickly I catch on.\u201d\n\u201cSo you noticed that as well.\u201d Arnold joined Rishe on the balcony. She tensed, but all he did was cast a curious glance at the view. \u201cWhat were you looking at?\u201d\n\u201cThe city.\u201d Rishe was hardly going to tell him she\u2019d been looking at nothing, merely ruminating on her mother\u2019s overbearing advice. The view from the balcony was spectacular, though. \u201cWhat\u2019s that over there?\u201d\n\u201cYou mean the library? The state invested funds to expand it. We have books from all over the world.\u201d\n\u201cReally? You have a library that big?\u201d Rishe\u2019s eyes sparkled with delight. She pointed out another building. \u201cWhat about that spire? It\u2019s beautiful.\u201d\n\u201cThe church and clock tower. The bells ring out the hour.\u201d\n\u201cOoh, how wonderful! And it looks like there\u2019s a rather big market there too?\u201d\n\u201cYes, the largest market in the city. Carts line up in the early morning. Most of the offerings are made fresh every day.\u201d\n\u201cAmazing! And what about that pretty mountain over there?\u201d\nRishe tried and failed to contain her excitement. She couldn\u2019t help but imagine what seeing all these places up close would be like. The grand library, the beautiful church that told the time, and the morning market with fresh, delicious food\u2014she wanted to experience it all.\nSeeing Arnold\u2019s bemused face, she said, \u201cWhat?\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m just wondering where all this interest is coming from,\u201d he said. \u201cYou were so reluctant to come, yet here you are, brimming with curiosity for my city.\u201d\n\u201cWell\u2026\u201d she trailed off, unsure of how to respond.\nWhat should I say? Should I just tell him the truth?\nThis wasn\u2019t a secret, but talking about her hopes and dreams to the man who had killed her was a little awkward. A strange self-consciousness settled on her, her cheeks heating as she mumbled, \u201cBecause I\u2019ve always wanted to.\u201d\nArnold looked at her keenly. \u201cWanted to what?\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019ve always wanted to come here.\u201d\nDuring her life as a merchant, Rishe developed her single dream to visit everywhere in the world. That dream was cut tragically short when only one country remained: Galkhein.\nIn each of her consecutive lives, Rishe\u2019s priority became staying alive. Every time, without fail, just as she found her footing, the world was plunged into chaos. She never had the chance to see Galkhein. This betrothal was her chance. \u201cIt\u2019s probably why I agreed to marry you,\u201d she added after a moment\u2019s hesitation.\nArnold swept a tepid glance over the city. \u201cThere\u2019s nothing here worth seeing.\u201d\n\u201cThat\u2019s not true! The places you just told me about sound amazing! Your citizens are clean and happy, your knights are proper and kind. Oh, and another\u2014\u201d \nRishe broke off enumerating Galkhein\u2019s charms as Arnold turned to look at her. His face was impassively calm, but something seemed to pass by underneath, like a shadow in deep water.\n\u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d Rishe said. \u201cDid I say something odd?\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m just amazed you could be so unaware of yourself.\u201d \nWh-what a rude thing to\u2014\n\u201cI\u2019ve never met anyone like you. No one has ever spoken to me the way you do. I don\u2019t know any girls of your class with the knowledge or the physical abilities you possess. Noblewomen don\u2019t concern themselves with such things.\u201d\nRishe, there is no need for you to think for yourself.\nShe frowned. \u201cPerhaps you\u2019re right, but everything I\u2019ve learned is precious to me. No one can take my skills away\u2014I value them with my life. Some may say that my knowledge is worthless, but it makes no difference to me.\u201d She turned from the balcony, fixing him with a piercing gaze. \u201cI\u2019m",
    "query_text": " the one who decides what I value.\u201d\nRishe had clawed free of her mother and father\u2019s indoctrination a long time ago. Man, woman\u2014it didn\u2019t matter. She could do anything. Being queen was not the culmination of her life; she wouldn\u2019t trade her freedom for anything.\nArnold matched her intensity. \u201cYou\u2019re right.\u201d He gently cupped her cheek in a one hand, swiping his thumb along the line of her jaw, smearing dust. \u201cLive your life here however you wish. I vow to do my utmost to protect you.\u201d\n\u201cHuh?\u201d\nHis vehemence took her by surprise. Arnold had every right to demand she act the"

    "prefix_text": "Ugh, not again!\u201d Oliver dug his knuckles into his forehead.\nRishe put two and two together. She hesitated, then said, \u201cSo there is one, then. As you must know, His Highness is trying to stamp it down without telling me.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d Oliver replied. \u201cHe should have mentioned it to you. You don\u2019t need to attend, but he will. At least, I hope he will. I think I managed to convince him.\u201d\nShe sympathized with Oliver. Under normal circumstances, it would be unheard of for the crown prince and his fianc\u00e9e to fail to appear at a banquet. \u201cDon\u2019t worry, Oliver. I\u2019ll go.\u201d\nOliver let out a sigh of relief. \u201cReally? Thank you so much, my lady. I\u2019ll put finding you a maid at the top of my to-do list.\u201d\n\u201cNo need.\u201d Rishe smiled. \u201cI can prepare for the party on my own.\u201d\nThis maid-selection process made Rishe uneasy. After witnessing that exchange between the servants in the garden, she imagined quarrels breaking out all through the palace. And she doubted the disputes would go away even after they decided.\nOliver frowned. \u201cBut won\u2019t dressing be difficult without a lady\u2019s maid?\u201d \nShe shook her head. \u201cI can do my hair and put on a gown by myself. I brought dresses and cosmetics from home. Don\u2019t worry.\u201d\nRishe ignored Oliver\u2019s stunned look, already reevaluating her cleaning plans.\n \n***\n \nThe first thing Rishe said to Arnold that night was, \u201cYour Highness, I have a request.\u201d Her gown rustled as she leaned in close. \u201cI would like some herb seed and a corner of the gardens. I made a list. I hope we can discuss this in more detail later.\u201d\nArnold was silent a moment. \u201cRishe.\u201d\n\u201cWhat? Didn\u2019t you tell me to let you know if there was anything I wanted?\u201d She looked at him quizzically, and Arnold sighed.\nShe\u2019d heard that he\u2019d finished his mountain of work and even managed to sleep for a while. He was dressed in his usual military black, trimmed with a red mantle and black gloves.\nArnold shook his head. \u201cThat\u2019s not what I mean. I\u2019m guessing that Oliver didn\u2019t tell you the reason for this party? It\u2019s merely for appearance\u2019s sake. I need to look like I\u2019m searching for a bride within our borders as well. There\u2019s no reason for you to attend.\u201d\nIt made sense. The crown prince\u2014the greatest catch in the kingdom\u2014marrying a foreigner without even the slightest nod to propriety would invite unwanted discontent from the nobility.\n\u201cHowever, we\u2019re betrothed,\u201d Arnold said. \u201cThis whole evening is merely a formality. And with news that you\u2019re my \u2018hostage\u2019 going around, you\u2019ll be an object of curiosity. I don\u2019t want to put you through that.\u201d\n\u201cWell, I already went to the trouble of getting ready.\u201d Rishe plucked at her soft blue dress, draped in fluttering layers around her like a flower bud. She\u2019d braided her hair, decorating it with accessories. Her makeup was light, her shoes polished to a mirror shine. Her only jewelry was a pair of pearl earrings.\n\u201cRishe\u2026\u201d\n\u201cYour Highness, the court may consider my status as a captive princess shameful in the extreme, but I don\u2019t.\u201d She\u2019d chosen this course, after all.\nArnold was again watching her with a mixture of wonder and confusion.\n\u201cSo don\u2019t worry,\u201d she said, extending her hand. \u201cFeel free to show off your fianc\u00e9e.\u201d\nArnold relented, his dashing smile creeping out once again. \u201cVery well. I should take advantage of this opportunity to touch my betrothed.\u201d\n\u201cWe\u2019re wearing gloves.\u201d\nArnold took Rishe\u2019s hand.\nA throng of guests was gathered in the ballroom as a group of musicians performed on a platform. Women in gowns stood clustered, while gentlemen in military attire grouped together. A mere glance was enough to tell their clothes were of the highest quality. They mingled happily, making small talk with glasses in hand.\nRishe let her hand rest on Arnold\u2019s arm as she paused at the threshold to take it all in. \u201cThis is a bigger event than I was expecting.\u201d\n\u201cIs it? I\u2019d say it\u2019s a rather small gathering, actually.\u201d\n\u201cMaybe for a military powerhouse,\u201d Rishe muttered. \nYet another reminder of Galkhein\u2019s wealth took her off guard. Arnold just looked bored.\n\u201cThe size doesn\u2019t matter,\u201d he said. \u201cIn the end, they\u2019re only here for gossip. Look, here they come.\u201d\nIn the blink of an eye, they were surrounded by guests.\n\u201cPrince Arnold, thank you for gracing us with an invitation,\u201d said one man. \u201cSuch a pleasure.\u201d \n\u201cThe pleasure is mine, Lord Abel,\u201d Arnold drawled.\n\u201cYour Highness! We were so glad to hear of your safe return,\u201d another guest chirped. \u201cPlease, our daughter is simply dying to be regaled with tales of your trip.\u201d\n\u201cI can\u2019t imagine I\u2019d have anything particularly exciting to share with her,\u201d Arnold said curtly.\nAfter the last few days, Rishe found this look of glazed apathy disturbing. His good looks only compounded it\u2014he was so handsome that every expression was stark.\nHe looks more like Emperor Arnold Hein now, but still not the same.\nArnold appeared to notice her watching him. When he looked at her, his sourness disappeared, replaced by a genuine smile. All around him, women found themselves flushing. Arnold paid no heed to their fervent gazes, instead leaning in to give Rishe a brief moment of consideration.\nThen he leaned in close enough to kiss her.\n\u201cA dull trip,\u201d he said again, pulling away. \u201cBut fortuitous. Without it, I would have never met the woman destined to be my wife.\u201d\nA shocked murmur rolled through the crowd. Rishe, who hadn\u2019t recovered from seeing Arnold\u2019s beautiful face at close range, barely noticed the looks of utter loathing the assembled women were throwing her.\n\u201cH-His Highness is smiling? At his hostage bride?\u201d\n\u201cHe called her his wife?! He\u2019s never even looked at us!\u201d\nThey were whispers, but they carried.\nA portly man stepped forward with his daughter in tow. \u201cYour Highness, do you mean to say that this lovely young woman is your fianc\u00e9e?\u201d\nEvery eye in the ballroom was on Rishe, alight with curiosity, envy, or schemes. None of them could hide their contempt. But Rishe didn\u2019t falter.\nThis is nothing compared to being publicly dumped in a banquet hall. And I\u2019ve done that seven times!\nShe offered a polite smile and an astoundingly correct curtsy. Left leg at a diagonal behind the right, back straight, head bowed. \u201cHow do you do? My name is Rishe Irmgard Weitzner.\u201d\nEven the most hostile guests could find nothing impolite in her greeting, no sign of rough manners from the rustic daughter of a backwater nation. Rishe had years of training in expectation of ascending to the throne. Occasionally, habits from her other lives slipped through, but Arnold appeared to be the only one who noticed.\nNow he was looking at her with satisfaction. \u201cLady Rishe has only just arrived, and her acquaintances are few and far between. I hope I can count on you all to hold me accountable should I prove an incompetent husband.\u201d\n\u201cB-but of course, Your Highness.\u201d\n\u201cCome, Rishe.\u201d Arnold guided her out of the ring of spectators. The stares continued to follow them as they walked away.\nRishe dropped her voice to a whisper. \u201cYou sure know how to invite the ire of women.\u201d\n\u201cWhatever",
    "query_text": " do you mean?\u201d\n\u201cThe way you harped on about me. Everything you said was tailor-made to stoke their jealousy. You\u2019ve gained me enemies, so thanks for that.\u201d\nArnold snorted. \u201cEverything I said was to protect you from enemies. They need to know you aren\u2019t just some trophy they can"

    "prefix_text": "!\u201d Rishe snapped. \u201cAre you all right? Let me get you some water!\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m fine. But now you\u2019ve fulfilled your obligation to the wine, haven\u2019t you?\u201d\nRishe didn\u2019t know what to say. He\u2019d helped her\u2014not by taking charge but by following her lead. Without cutting her down and telling her she was being foolish. Without rolling his eyes and dismissing her desires as trifles.\n\u201cThank you,\u201d Rishe said stiffly, which just made him laugh.\n\u201cWhat were you thinking about when we were dancing?\u201d he asked.\n\u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d\n\u201cYou were thinking about someone else, weren\u2019t you? Who?\u201d\nRishe didn\u2019t know a delicate way to say I was thinking about a future version of you I met in another life.\n\u201cHmm?\u201d His tone was oddly light, teasing even. But the gleam in his hunter\u2019s eyes said she wouldn\u2019t get away so easily.\nObviously, Rishe couldn\u2019t give him an honest answer. \u201cI wasn\u2019t thinking about anyone else. I was worried about you.\u201d\n\u201cWhy?\u201d\nThis was the closest she could come to the truth. \u201cWere you injured here?\u201d She patted her own left shoulder with her forefinger. \nArnold went silent. His left shoulder was slightly slower to react than his right\u2014if his right was at one hundred, then his left was at maybe ninety-eight. It was hardly noticeable, but Rishe had picked up on it. He was right-handed, and she wouldn\u2019t have noticed it if they\u2019d been dancing normally. \nThat, and if it hadn\u2019t been for memories from her past life.\nRishe had only managed to inflict a single injury on him. An instant, a moment\u2019s hesitation where she saw her chance and slashed left. Of course, he\u2019d shrugged off the injury and effortlessly run her through. \n\u201cHeh.\u201d Arnold finally broke his silence with grim laughter. His eyes sent shivers down her spine, cold and bewitching. In lieu of an answer, he reached for his collar, unfastening the clasp with a snap and drawing his jacket open with a rough tug.\nOh my.\nRishe drew in a breath. A great scar was engraved into the nape of his neck, just low enough to be concealed by clothing. It looked several years old. \u201cIt\u2019s an old wound. It continues to the top of my shoulder and pulls the skin taut.\u201d\n\u201cHow awful.\u201d Rishe couldn\u2019t help but reach out to gingerly touch the nape of his neck.\nArnold accepted her touch without a word. She\u2019d half expected to be slapped aside.\nHer fingers slowly traced the shape of it. She could feel the rough skin through her gloves.\nHe must have gotten this over a decade ago. Someone stabbed him\u2014and not just once or twice. They must have done it over and over to make this scar pattern.\nHer medical training had her shuddering at the image of a nine-year-old Arnold ashen and trembling with blood loss. The fact that he\u2019d survived and retained the use of his arm was incredible. And then to go on to wield a sword so skillfully\u2014his suffering must have been immense.\n\u201cOnly a few people know about this injury. You\u2019re the first to notice on your own.\u201d\n\u201cHow did it happen?\u201d\nThat grim smile returned as he looked down at Rishe. With the moon hanging behind him, he was as opaque as ever, but Rishe understood the sentiment.\nI shouldn\u2019t pry.\nRishe pulled her hand away, and that ominous smile that sent chills down her spine disappeared. Arnold put his jacket back in order, reclasping it at the neck.\nSomeone tried to kill Arnold Hein about ten years ago. But who and why? Rishe cast her eyes down as she ruminated. The most obvious beneficiaries of a dead crown prince would be potential heirs and those loyal to them. I believe Arnold has a younger brother, but I haven\u2019t met him yet.\nOdd. Rishe might be a hostage, but shouldn\u2019t she meet her future relatives? Perhaps it was Arnold\u2019s doing and not the will of the imperial family themselves. He didn\u2019t seem to want to involve her in anything unless it was absolutely necessary\u2014he hadn\u2019t told her about this ball, after all. \nRishe looked up at him. \u201cYour Highness, may I select my maids some time over the next few days?\u201d \n\u201cVery well. I\u2019ll tell Oliver to make that a priority.\u201d\n\u201cAh, I can do the selection myself. We needn\u2019t trouble him.\u201d\nArnold arched an amused brow. Gone was that unsettling smile, replaced with his easy manner. \u201cWhat are you planning this time?\u201d\n\u201cOh, nothing important,\u201d Rishe said. She picked up her empty glass. \u201cI\u2019m merely concerned about the servants\u2019 working conditions.\u201d\nTo protect her life and well-being, she needed to keep from dying at twenty years old again. And to do that, she had to prevent Arnold Hein\u2019s war. Her best bet would be to appeal to the important people she\u2019d known in her past lives. People with influence.\nPlus, there was a mountain of things she needed to do in preparation for the marriage ceremony.\nI need to sow a plot of land, grow herbs, do lots of shopping, get cheap alcohol, and then\u2026 \nRishe began a to-do list that had nothing to do with war in the least.\n \n***\n \nAs the ball wound to a close, a lone boy stood in the gloomy courtyard of the imperial palace. He had soft black hair and round blue eyes. No older than sixteen, he had an androgynous grace to him, gaze fixed on the balcony above. \nHe was watching a girl.\nShe had coral-colored hair, and even from this distance, he could tell she was beautiful. She stood there alone, apparently waiting for someone. Whoever it was must have shown up because her hand slipped from the banister, and she stepped away. Not too long after, a man appeared where she had been standing.\nThe man turned a silent glare down into the garden, as if he\u2019d known the boy had been there the whole time, despite the shadows.\nA shiver ran down the boy\u2019s spine and he smiled reflexively, delighting in the intense aura of threat the man gave off. It was just a warning, it seemed, as the man abruptly turned on his heel and disappeared. \n\u201cAww, we can\u2019t play together either?\u201d The boy hung his head. \u201cI miss you, Brother.\u201d\nIt had to be the woman. The beauty. She\u2019d made the boy\u2019s life hell since the day she arrived. \nHis brother had prohibited him from attending balls like this one. That was fine; he\u2019d sooner avoid them altogether. Still, he\u2019d wanted to meet that girl. \n\u201cBut we\u2019ll meet soon enough, won\u2019t we?\u201d He spoke to himself in a soft voice. \u201cI\u2019ve got plans for you, Sister.\u201d \n\n(2) chapter number given is likely out of range: 0\nChapter: 8\n\nChapter 3\nChapter 3\n \n\u201cYOU\u2019RE ALL SO USELESS!\u201d Diana the redheaded maid\u2019s voice rang out inside the stone washhouse. \nThree days had passed since the afternoon Rishe shook off her guard and came out to the well. Rishe was once again dressed to fit in with the maids. At Diana\u2019s shout, she looked up",

Rishe was grateful to be granted her freedom. In fact, she was smiling as she said, \u201cI hope you and Lady Mary are happy together.\u201d\n\u201cWhat?!\u201d\n\u201cMay we both lead fulfilling lives. Farewell!\u201d Rishe lifted the skirts of her evening gown and turned on her heel, departing as briskly as she could.\n\u201cHow do you know about Mary? I haven\u2019t told you I love her!\u201d The prince was shouting something behind her, but she paid him no mind. She had things to do.\nDuring her first loop, the prince\u2019s accusations had shocked her to the core and she\u2014foolishly so\u2014had attempted to defend herself. Now she knew better than to expect the prince to behave reasonably. \nHow will life unfold this time? I\u2019m excited to find out! Rishe fixed her mind on the future.\nThis is my seventh \u201cdo-over.\u201d I\u2019ve led happy and carefree lives before, but this time\u2014this time, I swear I\u2019ll live a long happy and carefree life!\nIn other words, she needed to avoid getting killed. At any cost. \n \n***\n \nIn the first loop, with her engagement broken and her reputation in tatters, Rishe roamed with nothing but the clothes on jewelry. Finding them a good-natured band, she hitched a ride to a neighboring country.\nFrom the merchant caravan, she learned a trade, studying how to procure stock and balance ledgers. Eventually, she set out on her own to travel the world. Her upbringing as a daughter of the nobility meant that, even at fifteen years old, Rishe possessed a keen sense for beauty.\nShe collected things that caught her eye and sold them to whoever found delight in her wares. Before she realized it, she had become a major vendor, employing a full staff. She had even done business with the king of a desert nation and the prince of a frozen country up north. She traveled to many distant places, realizing a dream born from her cossetted former life spent doing nothing but preparing to be queen.\nFive years passed, and just as she had only one country left to visit, Rishe fell victim to the war sweeping across the continent.\nThe next thing she knew, she was fifteen years old again and back at that party, with the prince poised to make his pronouncement.\n\u201cRishe Irmgard Weitzner! You are a vile woman! A truly malicious creature unworthy of the crown prince! As of this instant, our engagement is off!\u201d\nNaturally, she didn\u2019t understand what was going on at first. She looked around. Everything was the same. She stood in the same place wearing the same dress and draped in the same jewelry she\u2019d sold to the caravan.\nWas it a dream? Or was everything that had happened up until then the dream? In her confusion, all she could do was stare.\nRishe hurried out of the ballroom, the impending threat of exile hanging over her and the prince\u2019s entreaties to halt ringing in her ears.\nThis is perfect! Now I can get it right! I\u2019ll grab everything valuable from my room.\nRishe had enjoyed her life as a merchant, but she had always felt a stirring of regret about this night. If only she\u2019d brought some funds from home, she would\u2019ve had the capital to establish her business much sooner!\nSpeaking of this regret always prompted disbelief from her customers, including the king of the desert. \u201cWhat? That\u2019s what you\u2019d want to do over?!\u201d\nWhen she arrived back at home on the night of her second life, Rishe grabbed her jewelry box and as many of the books her late grandmother had left her as she could carry, then made haste to the forest to meet the caravan. But the stop at her house took time, and she missed them completely.\nIn that moment, Rishe made a stark realization. Different choices meant different mistakes. Opening one door would close another.\nAnd so the easy path to a life in commerce was closed to her.\nSure, she could try to build her business from the ground up, but personal connections were almost as essential to being a merchant as business savvy. It just wasn\u2019t realistic without a single acquaintance. \nSorting through her belongings in resignation, she came across a foreign encyclopedia of herbs among her grandmother\u2019s books. Taking it as a sign, Rishe sold her jewels elsewhere and used the funds to cross the sea and pursue the study of medicine.\nFortunately, Rishe retained all her knowledge from her previous life. She remembered that certain expensive herbs could be acquired cheaply in other regions. When word spread of a disease running rampant in a neighboring country, she recalled that too. This foreknowledge proved invaluable, as did her wide travel and exposure to many different teachers with many different points of view.\nAs such, Rishe led a successful life as an apothecary. She saved a feeble prince, synthesized a number of rare medicines with her mercantile knowledge, and thus spent her days in the simple joy of helping those in need.\nUnfortunately, all the joy in the world couldn\u2019t stand up to an epidemic. Thus ended her second life. \nOnce again, she found herself in the moment of her broken engagement, the curtain rising on the third loop. Her next four lives proceeded much the same way. As a skilled lady\u2019s maid, she helped a young noblewoman to a fortuitous marriage. Once, she even disguised herself as a man and became a knight. Every life was worth living, and she enjoyed them all. She enjoyed living, period.\nThere was just one problem.\nNo matter what I do, I die at twenty.\nShe enjoyed her lives, but she was not permitted to do so for long. With this time limit always hanging over her, she spent each loop in a state of constant activity.\nI would love to take it easy for a while. Is a little leisure time too much to ask? Obviously I don\u2019t want to die either! This time, I\u2019ll make as much money as I can in the first five years. Then, when I turn twenty, I\u2019ll live a life free of worldly cares. I\u2019ll do whatever\u2019s necessary to stay alive!\nHer mind made up, Rishe began her seventh life in a dead sprint through the palace. Regardless of her future plans, she was in a race against time. She needed to beat the messenger bearing news of her scandal.\nAs she ran, she yanked off her hair ornaments; she planned to sell them and didn\u2019t want to risk losing one. Her hair billowed out behind her, falling in loose waves.\nSuddenly, an idea occurred to her, one she hadn\u2019t had in any of her previous six lives.\nLeaving through the palace gardens would be faster. I can climb down a tree from the balcony.\nRishe had gone to war as a knight in the life just before this one. After the punishing battlefield training, climbing trees was nothing.\nSeamlessly, she changed direction. She raced for the balcony, where she ran into something at full speed.\n\u201cBwargh!\u201d Rishe let out a very unladylike grunt, staggering a few steps. She looked up to see what she\u2019d bounced off of. \u201cOh\u2026\u201d\nAn exceptionally handsome man stood in her path.\nHe had refined, patrician features and cruel, thin lips. He was slender yet powerful; even through his clothes, Rishe could tell his body was well conditioned. His jet-black hair covered his ears, creeping down to the nape of his neck. The tips of his locks bounced with his movements. They looked to be soft to the touch.\nFrom head to toe, he was a pleasure to look at\u2014but what held Rishe\u2019s attention were his eyes. They were long in shape and impossibly blue, but they possessed a blade-sharp intensity. His gaze was clear, beautiful, and cold as ice. His eyelashes cast shadows on his striking face. He was a work of art.\nCurrently, this work of art was staring her down with a look that could kill.\nHe laughed. \u201cYou barreled right into me. For a moment, I thought I\u2019d been attacked by a wild boar.\u201d\nIt was an exceedingly rude thing to say to a stranger, but as luck would have it, this man was not a stranger. At least not to Rishe.\n\u201cWhat are you even doing here?\u201d the man went on. \u201cThe party is in",
    "query_text": " the\u2014\u201d\nRishe interrupted him with a wordless shout of dismay. The man drew back, reflexively reaching for his sword. He composed himself with visible difficulty. \u201cWho are you? You look like any noblewoman, but your manner is\u2026\u201d \n\u201cEmperor Arnold Hein!\u201d \nThe man\u2019s eyes widened. He didn\u2019t mistake her surging contempt. Rishe had crossed swords with this man. Recently. He was the one responsible for ending her sixth life. \nHe must be a guest at the banquet. It makes sense.\nArnold Hein was the scion of a military nation not far from Rishe\u2019s home country of Hermity, the one in which they now stood. Their kingdoms, so recently at war, had brokered an ostensible peace"

Rishe couldn\u2019t help but admire how pretty she was. She truly did wish her happiness. But right now, she needed to take care of herself. \n\u201cWell.\u201d Rishe suddenly broke into a smile, making Dietrich flinch. \u201cI think it\u2019s time for me to be on my way.\u201d\nShe regretted losing access to her room, but she knew her parents wouldn\u2019t let her in. Turning her back on the crowd, Rishe contemplated her next move.\n\u201cWait, Lady Rishe!\u201d Mary\u2019s voice rang out.\n\u201cThat\u2019s right. You\u2019re not going anywhere, Rishe!\u201d The prince joined her. \u201cYou won\u2019t get away with treating me like trash to relieve your own injured heart.\u201d\n\u201cUgh, enough already!\u201d Rishe\u2019s patience was fraying. \u201cI don\u2019t have anything else to say to you. Goodbye!\u201d\n\u201cKnights, stop her!\u201d\nReluctantly, the knights moved to tail Rishe as she walked briskly back down the path. She sympathized with them, but she wasn\u2019t about to let them keep her here. Rounding a corner, she sensed something uncanny. She stopped, the knights quickly catching up with her.\n\u201cMy apologies, Lady Rishe. If you could please remain for just a\u2014whoa!\u201d\nRishe grabbed the hilt of the knight\u2019s sword. Yanking it from his belt, she spun around and stood at the ready. Metal rang against metal as Rishe parried a blow. She glared at her would-be attacker as he stepped out of the shadows.\nArnold Hein!\n\u201cWell, what do you know.\u201d The man smiling so sweetly while their swords locked was the very man who had ended her life. \u201cYou do have some skill.\u201d\nMetal screeched and slid, before Arnold sheathed his sword. Rishe lowered hers. Neither looked away.\n\u201cWho the hell are you?\u201d demanded one of the knights.\n\u201cStand down, good sirs,\u201d Rishe said. \u201cYour interference will only make this worse.\u201d\nThis mostly served to befuddle the knights further. Rishe absolutely couldn\u2019t allow them to come to blows with the crown prince of a friendly nation. And they couldn\u2019t beat him\u2014not even if they took him all at once. Rishe had blocked his blow, but her arm was completely numb. To think he\u2019d be even more powerful in five years.\nHe regarded her unabashedly. \u201cRishe, was that your name? Where did you learn such swordsmanship?\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m afraid I cannot say. Besides, you were clearly going easy on me.\u201d\n\u201cHa! You could tell?\u201d\nArnold\u2019s manner was throwing her off. He seemed to be enjoying himself. He\u2019s laughing. This monstrous prince is\u2026actually laughing.\nWhen she had met him in her other life, he was cold and merciless, like a genuine monster. And yet here he stood, mellow and smiling.\nThe Emperor Arnold Hein I knew was twenty-four years old, so he\u2019s, what? Nineteen now? This is so weird. He\u2019s grinning like a boy getting into a scrape.\nThat attack had been good-natured as well, almost playful. It had muscle behind it but certainly not any lethal intent. He\u2019d just wanted to force Rishe to catch the blow. She found it unbelievable that he could exude such an overpowering air of menace when he was just messing around.\nWhile Rishe was focused on Arnold, Mary and Dietrich caught up, seemingly recovered.\n\u201cExcuse me, my lord!\u201d Mary squeaked. \u201cI-I-I don\u2019t know who you are, but kindly step away from Lady Rishe!\u201d\n\u201cYes, do as she says! Who the hell are you, anyway?!\u201d\nDon\u2019t tell me Prince Dietrich doesn\u2019t recognize one of his personal guests.\nDietrich\u2019s interests did not lean toward diplomacy; he likely hadn\u2019t bothered to introduce himself to Arnold. Mary, for her part, seemed to grasp that Arnold wasn\u2019t ordinary. She stood up to defend Rishe, despite the tremble in her voice. In a better world, perhaps the two of them could have become friends.\n\u201cThat\u2019s your ex-fianc\u00e9?\u201d Arnold cocked a brow. \u201cHe\u2019s even worse than I imagined. Pathetic.\u201d\nDietrich flushed. \u201cI\u2019ll have your head!\u201d\n\u201cDietrich, I beg of you, contain yourself,\u201d Rishe said, then rounded on Arnold. \u201cAs for you, Your Highness\u2014you know who Dietrich is, and you know what speaking carelessly could mean. Are you trying to pick a fight?\u201d\n\u201cWhatever do you mean?\u201d Arnold\u2019s brows lifted high, making him the picture of innocence. \u201cBelieve me, Lady Rishe, every word I speak is chosen with extreme care.\u201d\nFinally realizing who Arnold was, Dietrich visibly paled. \u201cArnold? He\u2019s the crown prince of Galkhein?\u201d\nMary yelped. The knights stood down, shamefaced. The gossip-hungry neighbors who\u2019d gathered to witness a scandal play out drew back in fear.\n\u201cHe\u2019s the demon prince? The one who single-handedly destroyed a whole order of enemy knights?\u201d\n\u201cWatch your tongue, fool! Do you want him to do the same to you?\u201d\nThe two nations enjoyed peaceful relations, but Arnold remained the dreaded prince, heir to the throne of a former enemy. Current rumor wasn\u2019t as widespread as it would be in five years, but he was still regarded with distrust.\nThe onlookers stood rooted to the spot, too terrified to flee.\nWell, this has devolved into a full-fledged disaster.\nRishe heaved a frustrated sigh. \u201cPrince Arnold, to what do we owe this honor? Surely a crown prince would not draw his sword for a mere jest.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m here on business,\u201d Arnold said. \u201cBut first, I must beg forgiveness for my rudeness.\u201d\nHuh, what do you know? Once he became emperor, he\u2019d gladly behead any subject who so much as dared speak a word against him.\nI guess at nineteen he still knew how to apologize.\nIf that surprised her, Arnold\u2019s next act completely obliterated her sense of reality. \nWith a flourish, he fell to his knees. \n\u201cHuh?\u201d Is this actually happening? \nHe was a man destined for an imperial crown. A man who would stand at the head of a military powerhouse and spread his rule across continents.\nArnold, known for his frigid pride, knelt to the disgraced daughter of a duke.\nAnd not only that\u2014his head was bowed, looking nothing so much as a knight swearing allegiance to his lady. If it were anyone else, it would be a delightful, pious image. Instead, the assembled looked on in terrified awe.\nNot Rishe, though.\n\u201cWhat are you doing?\u201d she hissed. \u201cGet up!\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m apologizing for my baseless impertinence. Also, I\u2019m asking you\u2026\u201d He trailed off to take Rishe\u2019s hand, tugging her forward so forcefully she staggered. He gazed up at her.\nUgh. He\u2019s so beautiful. No matter how many times she looked at him, it didn\u2019t become any less disarming. Long eyelashes, arched brows, a noble nose. His bright blue eyes reminded her of the drift ice she\u2019d seen in a northern kingdom, gazing out from a ship in one of her past lives. She knew she was dwelling on this to buy time, even as the reality before her sank in.\n\u201c\u2026to become my wife.\u201d\nShe froze, unable to process the words. \u201cWhat?\u201d Rishe glanced around, desperately searching the faces of the crowd. They all seemed as stunned as she felt. She looked down at Arnold again. \u201cYour wife?\u201d \n\u201cYes, that\u2019s right.\u201d\n\u201cYou want me to become your wife?\u201d\n\u201cYes.\u201d\nRishe couldn\u2019t speak. This was truly happening. It was real. It clicked into place in her head, and she let out a strangled grunt.\nWhat is going on? Why is this happening?\nShock lapped at her, fuzzing at the corners of her vision. He wanted to marry her. Arnold wanted to marry Rishe. Her murderer wanted to marry her.\nWhy is he doing this? He must have some ulterior motive, a broader goal. But I have to give him an answer.\nThe onlookers were holding their breath as Rishe said flatly, \u201cI reject your proposal.\u201d\nArnold said nothing.\nShe had to reject him. She was going to live a long, peaceful, carefree life, damn it, and no one would stop her. And yet\u2026\nArnold began to laugh, and the deep, creeping sense of dread inside Rishe only grew. Why does he seem so amused by this?!\n \n***\n \nHer previous life was her sixth. Disguised as a man, Rishe rose as a warrior of an island country she came upon in her travels. It was a conventional yet charming kingdom formed of red brick. After striking up a friendship with a group of knights who didn\u2019t realize she was a woman, Rishe followed their advice and joined them.\nThe training was grueling enough to make her wish she were dead. Back when she had lived as a noble, she\u2019d learned how to wield a sword for basic self-defense, but training as a noble lady had in no way prepared her for this.",
    "query_text": " She drilled relentlessly, barely taking the time to sleep. Just as she became a full-fledged knight, Emperor Arnold\u2019s forces lay siege to the castle.\n \n***\n \nHow could this happen? \nIn her seventh life, Rishe wearily sank into her chair. Across from her sat Arnold, his legs crossed and chin propped up on his hand, watching her lazily.\n\u201cWhat\u2019s the matter?\u201d he asked. \u201cYou seem unhappy.\u201d\n\u201cYou could say that.\u201d Even her voice was grumpy. Still, she couldn\u2019t very well tell him it was because she bore a grudge from a previous life. After the first time her life rewound to that pivotal moment, she\u2019d resolved to keep"

I must bring to bear all my knowledge and influence as a crown princess.\nRishe didn\u2019t know Arnold\u2019s plans, but she had no intention of sitting around and waiting for him to use her as he pleased. She\u2019d spend her time as his consort wisely. Everything must serve her ultimate goal: to live longer than five years, and live well.\nHer fierce determination must have shown on her face because Arnold gave her a little bemused smile. \u201cYes?\u201d\nGod! Rishe grimaced at that flawlessly handsome countenance. Such beauty, possessed by such powerful destruction. The fact that he\u2019d been the man to kill her did nothing to lessen her fascination. In fact, it almost made it worse. The study of contrasts.\n\u201cSorry, I just\u2014\u201d\nShe was interrupted by the horses\u2019 loud whinnies.\n\u201cStop! Hey, stop the coach!\u201d\nShouts drifted back from conveyance ahead of theirs, which contained the luggage and attendants. The squadron of knights tailing the column of coaches sped off toward the front.\n\u201cWho do you think you\u2014graaargh!\u201d\nThat didn\u2019t sound good. Rishe moved to climb out, but Arnold was faster. He drew his sword.\n\u201cHey!\u201d\nArnold locked the door from the outside. \u201cStay hidden.\u201d\nWhy is he putting himself in danger? That\u2019s what knights are for! The fact that Rishe had been about to do the same thing didn\u2019t occur to her. It\u2019s probably bandits. He told me to stay hidden in here, but I\u2019m not so sure about that.\nArnold had left her locked in from the outside, hoping to keep her safe, but Rishe didn\u2019t like her odds. There were five coaches, but this one was certainly the grandest. It locked on the inside as well, but that wouldn\u2019t stop someone with enough determination. If she did as she was told, she\u2019d just be waiting patiently for a bandit to break a window and drag her out.\nKeeping one eye on the coachmen fleeing into the forest, Rishe began a methodical search for something to help her. Right\u2014her hairpin!\nThis sure brings me back. She unfastened it, twisting it into the gap in the door. Back when I was a maid, my lady would lock herself in her chambers all the time to avoid her studies. I had to break her out just like this.\nThe lock on the coach was simple, and it came open easily. Once she was free, she scanned her surroundings. She didn\u2019t see anyone who looked immediately hostile, but there was noise up ahead. Cautiously, she headed toward it.\nBefore long, she found Arnold.\nWow.\nRoughly ten men\u2014the bandits, she presumed\u2014lay crumpled on the ground. In their midst stood Arnold, in the process of tripping another man into the dirt. He scowled, blade at the man\u2019s throat. \u201cIs that it, then?\u201d\n\u201cGwugh!\u201d\nArnold kicked the bandit in the stomach, eyes blazing with cruelty. \u201cThat\u2019s all the thrill you offer me after I went to the trouble of drawing my sword? Barely worth it. I\u2019m bored already.\u201d\nHe wasn\u2019t angry; on the contrary, he stared his enemies down with chilly disappointment, as if this had all been a letdown. Even Arnold\u2019s own knights seemed terrified of their master when he was in a mood. Arnold smoothly flicked the blood off his sword, wiping the blade on the bandit\u2019s shirt before sheathing it. The rest of the men on the ground seemed to be unconscious.\nWait, he didn\u2019t kill anyone? Why not? Is it because we haven\u2019t reached Galkhein?\nShe supposed even Arnold knew better than to go around killing the citizens of other countries. Or perhaps he had yet to become the ruthless monster she knew him as.\nArnold seemed to sense her gaze, turning around with a start. Genuine emotion bloomed on his face, worlds away from the blank mask he wore to face down the bandits. \u201cHow did you get out of the coach?\u201d\nRishe shrugged. \u201cIf I tell you, you\u2019ll be able to prevent me from doing it again.\u201d\nArnold snickered. \u201cYou continue to amaze me.\u201d\nHow can you go from ice-cold to suddenly looking like a normal nineteen-year-old? It\u2019s disconcerting. \nRishe fought down her disquiet as a man alighted from a coach and shouted, \u201cYour Highness! Not again!\u201d He was Oliver, one of the prince\u2019s attendants. He had silver hair and was roughly as tall as Arnold.\n\u201cWhat do you think all these knights are for, decoration? Why do you insist on endangering yourself?\u201d\nRishe had only met Oliver briefly a few days ago, but he didn\u2019t appear to be intimidated by Arnold at all. And, well\u2026he\u2019s not wrong.\nShe feared the menace would return to Arnold\u2019s expression, but he just looked annoyed. \u201cI could tell they were prepared to kill. I\u2019d prefer to take the burden on myself than risk multiple injuries so far afield. And we already have casualties.\u201d\nHe was right. Several injured knights leaned listlessly among the trees. Arnold issued orders to those still able-bodied. \u201cFirst squad, see to the wounded. Second squad, arrest these men.\u201d\n\u201cYes, sir!\u201d\nOliver appeared unsatisfied. \u201cYour Highness, that is a weak justification. I\u2019m overjoyed you\u2019re well, but you must consider Lady Rishe. Perhaps next time we run into a team of murderous brigands, you could allow your consort to remain in the coach.\u201d\n\u201cI told her to remain in the coach!\u201d\nRishe quickly averted her gaze, turning her attention to the wounded knights. They didn\u2019t appear badly injured, yet they all seemed exhausted.\n\u201cExcuse me, can I take a look?\u201d Rishe approached the knight acting as a medic. He looked round, startled by her presence.\n\u201cNonsense, my lady. Don\u2019t trouble yourself, you must have had quite a scare.\u201d\nThis was not unreasonable, but the wariness in his eyes made it clear he wanted her nowhere near his comrade. He isn\u2019t just being polite. He truly is on guard. \nBeside them, an injured knight groaned as another helped him up. \u201cWhat\u2019s wrong with you?\u201d the second knight asked the first. \n\u201cI-I feel\u2026numb.\u201d\n\u201cWhat? Damn.\u201d The knight grabbed up one of the fallen bandit\u2019s swords, going pale as he inspected the blade. \u201cYour Highness, look at this. Poison.\u201d\nArnold clicked his tongue. \u201cLocate every laceration and bind them close to the heart. Suck the poison from the wounds.\u201d\nHe mostly got that right, at least. In the meantime, Rishe located the nearest bound bandit and pulled his dagger out of its sheath. Its wet coating gleamed in the sunlight, just as the knight had said.\nThey applied the poison liberally\u2014whatever it is must be cheap and easily bought in bulk.\nShe wafted the smell toward her, bracing for something rancid, but detected nothing. Then she brought it closer to her nose.\nIt smells sweet, like an overripe apple. Shea grass and\u2026bluecap mushrooms. All the knights appear to have the same symptoms, so I won\u2019t have to check every blade.\nRishe stood back up and headed for the coach.\nOliver took a step after her. \u201cYour Highness, Lady Rishe is\u2014\u201d\n\u201cLeave her. She may do as she pleases.\u201d\n\u201cShe\u2019s well trained,\u201d Oliver mused. \u201cBut a battlefield is no place for a young lady. She probably wasn\u2019t prepared for such a dreadful spectacle.\u201d\nRishe ignored the murmurs and focused on her work. There they are. I\u2019ll take these, these, and\u2026\n\u201cThe poison must be a sleeping drug,\u201d she overheard Arnold saying. \u201cHunters use such drugs to weaken larger prey. I doubt this dose is lethal.\u201d\n\u201cBut it certainly is annoying,\u201d replied Oliver. \u201cWe\u2019re still two days out from Galkhein. Lugging a company of sleeping men in armor won\u2019t be pleasant.\u201d\n\u201cWe\u2019ll have to stop somewhere nearby. A hunter\u2019s settlement. Perhaps they will have an antidote\u2014\u201d\n\u201cExcuse me.\u201d Rishe, who\u2019d returned from the carriage, raised a hand. \u201cI have an antidote.\u201d\n\u201cWhat?\u201d\nThe entire company stared at her in awe.\n \n***\n \nAs it turned out, Arnold\u2019s guess was right. \nThis sweet-smelling substance was a hunter\u2019s drug, made from ingredients that were only toxic in their raw form. Heat rendered them harmless. Rishe had encountered this poison several times before, curing a customer afflicted with it during her life as an apothecary.\n\u201cA lethal dose for a grown man would fill a wine glass. They likely got less than a hundredth of that,\u201d Rishe explained to Arnold, not looking up from her work. \u201cStill, the numbness can block their airways with the roots of their tongues. It\u2019s best to lay them on their sides.\u201d\n\u201cYes, I understand the theory and the solution.\u201d Arnold gazed down at Rishe\u2019s hands. \u201cThe part I\u2019m struggling with is why you\u2019re the one telling me this.\u201d\n\u201cWell, I know how to make the antidote,\u201d Rishe said patiently as she muddled the herbs together in the white soup bowl she\u2019d borrowed for her flowers. She crushed them with the back of a spoon before adding another dried flower, crushing that as well, and combining them to form a paste. This process would be easier with a pestle, but she wasn\u2019t about to complain. \u201cThis poison is common\u2014it\u2019s cheap and easy to make, which often means the antidote is simple as well.\u201d\nThe antidote was synthesized, in fact, when hunters witnessed a deer showing no symptoms after eating a certain mushroom. They tested those along with other common herbs the deer ate. Rishe mentally thanked them for their scientific rigor as she added a bit of water, straining it all through a cloth.\nRishe stood up, brandishing the bowl of bright green medicine. \u201cBoiling would make the antidote more potent, but this works in a pinch.\u201d\nThat was when she noticed the astonished stares. Unsure of what social faux paus she\u2019d perpetrated, she looked away. Oliver was completely stunned. Arnold looked thoughtful. It was imperative the knights were treated as soon as possible, but to Rishe\u2019s dismay, no one was moving. \nDo they not trust me? That makes sense. Anyone would be reluctant to use medicine concocted by a complete stranger. But the longer we wait, the harder the poison will become to cure. \nShe needed to dispel their doubts. Rolling up her sleeve, Rishe approached Arnold and drew his sword from its scabbard. \u201cI need to borrow this for a moment, Your Highness.\u201d\n\u201cWhat are you\u2014\u201d\nShe pushed the blade against the soft skin of her inner arm. Blood welled up, along with the sharp sting of pain. Nothing compared to her injuries sustained during her life as a knight, though.\nArnold did not share her nonchalance. \u201cWhat do you think you\u2019re doing?!\u201d\nHe grabbed for her arm. She stepped out of his grasp. Was blood truly so shocking? She didn\u2019t have the time to worry about it. Clutching the overfull bowl, Rishe hurried back to the knights.\n\u201cDon\u2019t worry. This isn\u2019t poison,\u201d Rishe said. She demonstrated as much by drizzling it with a spoon over her own fresh wound. It stung. That meant the ingredients were working.\n\u201cThis is crushed liquori grass, luqua flowers, and carilya nuts. I\u2019ll swallow some if that\u2019s what it takes to prove it\u2019s safe.\u201d It was horribly bitter; she hoped it wouldn\u2019t come to that. \u201cThe paralysis will last for days. Please make up your mind quickly.\u201d\n\u201cMake up our mind?\u201d\n\u201cWill you allow me to cure the poison? Or would you rather drag paralyzed soldiers all the way to Galkhein? I suppose you could waste His Highness\u2019s time searching for a hunter\u2019s settlement to use their antidote.\u201d She smiled serenely. \u201cIt makes no difference to us. Right, Your Highness?\u201d\nIn the end, Rishe applied the antidote.\nThe recovery took a few hours. While they waited, Rishe picked herbs in the same meadow she\u2019d been gazing at with yearning from the carriage. A fortuitous turn of events. She found anti-inflammatory herbs and flowers to ease sour bellies, ingredients for curing headaches, and mushrooms for inducing slumber. She wrapped them all up in a handkerchief.\nIn the meantime, Arnold dispatched a messenger to this region\u2019s lord, making arrangements to deliver the apprehended bandits. After coordinating with Oliver, he drifted over to Rishe.\n\u201cI see your interest in flowers is mercenary, rather than ornamental,\u201d he said, surveying the heaps of herbs gathered on the bank of the pond. He sat down beside her.\nWhen he didn\u2019t say anything more, Rishe went back to work plucking leaves from plants with valuable stems. The leaves had no medicinal effects, but they did make a decent broth. Slumber mushroom spores were a nuisance unless dried; they were spread out beside her in the sun.\nI wonder, would he be annoyed if I attached herbs to the roof of the coach? That would be unusual adornment for a crown prince\u2019s retinue, but it wouldn\u2019t hurt to ask.\nShe realized, quite suddenly, that Arnold was looking at her. At her hands, specifically. He sat cross-legged with his chin propped on his fist, staring absently, like a kid watching a column of ants march by.\nWhat is so fascinating about herbs?\nTheir eyes met. \u201cAm I bothering you?\u201d he asked.\nRishe shook her head slowly. \u201cNot at all. I was just curious what caught your eye.\u201d\n\u201cNothing specific. I was just thinking how very unusual you are.\u201d He was smiling again. \u201cI\u2019m looking forward to how you\u2019ll surprise me next.\u201d\nLike I\u2019m some sort of rare pet he bought to entertain him. She didn\u2019t like that. Nothing she\u2019d done was at all remarkable\u2014normal tasks performed by a normal person.\n\u201cI didn\u2019t make that antidote for your amusement.\u201d\n\u201cI realize that.\u201d The instigating smile faded from his lips. \u201cYou know, those knights you coerced into taking your home-brewed medicine were all born in the slums.\u201d\n\u201cCoerced? That\u2019s hardly the word I\u2019d use.\u201d\n\u201cGalkhein claims to value merit above all else, but in the end, people are judged by where they came from. Despite this, those men fought their way up from nothing.\u201d\nRishe paused in plucking the seeds from a flower and looked up at Arnold.\n\u201cThe men with the worst cases of the paralysis were all newly assigned. They\u2019ve spent weeks training to ensure this mission was a success. That older knight\u2014the one who bowed to you\u2014sustained an injury protecting the rookies. He cares deeply about his men.\u201d\n\u201cYou seem to care about them too,\u201d Rishe commented.\n\u201cI handpicked them for my retinue.\u201d Arnold clambered to his feet, only to fall into a bow. \u201cAnd you kept them safe. You have my deepest gratitude.\u201d\nRishe found herself at a loss for words. Was this Arnold putting on a mask to hide the monster within? Or was this the real him? She remembered the way he\u2019d looked when he held his blade to the bandit\u2019s throat, like a child poised to break a toy he had grown bored of.\n\u201cDon\u2019t mention it,\u201d Rishe said, uncomfortable. \u201cI knew how to do it, so I did.\u201d\nArnold laughed softly. \u201cBe that as it may, I\u2019d still count a noblewoman who can brew remedies from wildflowers by the side of the road a rare find.\u201d\n\u201cEarlier, when you grabbed my wrist\u2026\u201d Rishe steered the subject away from her incongruous knowledge. \u201cYou broke your promise. You said you wouldn\u2019t touch me.\u201d\n\u201cThat was reflex,\u201d Arnold protested. \u201cI thought you were going to hurt yourself.\u201d\nSuch a simple conversation, so casual. It had Rishe feeling positively peculiar.\n\u201cWhy are your knights so wary around me?\u201d she asked. \n\u201cWary? Oh, they were all at the palace when you broke your first engagement. They\u2019re most likely concerned I\u2019m bringing home a villainous jilt who will lead to my ruin. Something silly like that.\u201d\n\u201cI see.\u201d Apparently, being dumped by a prince called into question one\u2019s herbalist abilities.\n\u201cI\u2019m glad you mentioned it,\u201d Arnold went on, \u201cbecause there may be people in Galkhein who will oppose our union. I will do everything in my power to protect you, but you must bring any insults or threats to me right away.\u201d\n\u201cAre there likely to be many?\u201d\n\u201cIn theory, the crown prince may choose his own wife,",

I\u2019ll be occupied over the next few days, but feel free to use the guest apartments in the main palace if you get tired of choking to death,\u201d Arnold said before he left.\nAccording to Oliver, work had piled up while the prince was away, and it wasn\u2019t just a few things that could be dispensed with over a few days working around the clock.\nEmperor Arnold Hein\u2026 He\u2019s just a crown prince right now, but I still wish I knew what\u2019s going on in his head. For now, I\u2019ll just focus on what I can do. Like make this place livable.\nShe changed into her plainest dress and rolled up her sleeves. The knights who\u2019d remained to serve as her guard kept watch over her as she went from window to window, throwing them all open.\nIn a stroke of luck, the weather was good, and the detached wing was well placed to soak up the sun. The lack of any creature comforts made it look ascetic and drab, but once it was furnished, Rishe had no doubt it would be lovely.\nLeaving the top floors to air out, Rishe found the stairs to the basement. She pushed the heavy wooden doors open, and mice skittered over her feet. The knights yelped as Rishe descended into the darkness.\n\u201cL-Lady Rishe, why are you going down here?\u201d\n\u201cCleaning supplies are usually kept in the basement. See?\u201d\nThe knights followed her gaze to a duster, broom, dustpan, and pile of fresh cloths. She filled a bucket with water and went to work, rolling up a handkerchief to cover her mouth as she swept dust down from high on the walls. Then she swept up all the dust on the floor.\nIt\u2019s always satisfying to tackle a place this filthy.\nShe corralled the dust bunnies until they were piled up like snow in the center of the hall, and then she swept them out the open door. Once the floors were free of debris, she attacked them with the cloth.\n\u201cLady Rishe, is there anything we can do to help?\nRishe was grateful for the knight\u2019s offer, but she shook her head. \u201cYour job is to guard me, not do my housekeeping.\u201d\n\u201cThis is quite the place to clean on your own, detached though it may be,\u201d the knight said hesitantly. \u201cIt\u2019s not too late to move into the guest chambers instead.\u201d\n\u201cThat\u2019s all right. I like the place already.\u201d\nRishe remained steadfast in her refusal for one reason: readying guest chambers was an awful chore. The palace maids would be expected to work overnight to prepare them, even if the guests were only staying a single night. No speck of dust or strand of hair could remain. Certainly no wrinkled sheets. Rishe knew how exhausting and rigorous a maid\u2019s job was, how nerve-racking.\nShe refused to put the poor dears through such an ordeal for just a few days\u2019 stay. From the sound of things, the palace wasn\u2019t equipped with many housemaids. No doubt they already had their hands full.\n\u201cBesides, take a look.\u201d She held out her arms wide, gesturing to her sparkling clean floor. The knights stared at the bright room in admiration. \u201cCleaning a place with your own hands makes living there that much more satisfying, you see.\u201d\nThe knights smiled their awkward but good-natured agreement.\nRishe worked tirelessly, and before long, the chambers where she would spend the night were ready. The knights offered to carry in the bed, which she allowed.\nWhile they brought in furniture, Rishe started cleaning another room. She had run out of clean water, so she quietly slipped out to the well without informing the knights. It wasn\u2019t quite fair to them, but these were the palace grounds. Surely she didn\u2019t need to be chaperoned everywhere.\nBesides, they\u2019re guards in name only. They\u2019re clearly just here to report my movements to Arnold Hein, Rishe reflected as she walked through a courtyard full of flowers, bucket in hand. Iridescent butterflies cavorted playfully around her feet. He doesn\u2019t seem in a hurry to introduce me to the king. Although if I\u2019m just a hostage, that doesn\u2019t surprise me.\nShe hoped she got to meet the current emperor at least once. The future Arnold\u2019s violent conquest only began after he killed the man and made himself emperor, after all.\nI wonder what happened to Arnold Hein after I died in my past life. Did he reign supreme after winning his war? Or did some country manage to put a stop to his conquest? Whatever the case, I absolutely cannot allow him to start a conflict this time. Being the empress of a wartime nation sounds like so much work! The very thought is unacceptable!\nPerhaps they could divorce, but Rishe had a feeling that if Arnold decided to discard her in the middle of a war, she would fail in her mission to make it past the age of twenty. Better to avoid the situation all together.\nWait. When she thought about it, the cause of every single one of Rishe\u2019s deaths was Arnold and his war. I died fighting. I died when Galkhein\u2019s army invaded\u2026\nLooking at her six lives, all of them had ended in more or less the same way.\nRishe found herself crouched on the ground, cradling her head in her hands. Maybe we should get a divorce right now. But it wasn\u2019t in Rishe\u2019s nature to take back her decisions once she\u2019d made them. \nIf I leave, I\u2019ll probably just die in some war-related disaster again. If I can\u2019t live apart from him, I should take this opportunity to learn everything that I can. \nRishe didn\u2019t know the cause of her repeating lives, but there was no guarantee that the loops were infinite. She had to operate under the possibility that this life could be her last. This required some thought, but standing around seething with anxiety wouldn\u2019t help.\nRight now I\u2019ll focus on cleaning. Once the bath is here, I\u2019ll scrub off all the dust and travel exhaustion. And then I can finally relax! \nBrimming with new determination, she stood up and headed for the well. She was forestalled by the sound of jeering giggles. \n\u201cAww, look at the new girl, trying so hard,\u201d said one voice.\n\u201cAll the enthusiasm in the world won\u2019t make a difference,\u201d said another. \u201cWe\u2019re going to be the crown princess\u2019s maids, not you.\u201d\nThe first added, \u201cHey, are you even listening? Stop wasting your time!\u201d\nRishe heard a weak scream, followed by a thump, like a body hitting the ground. She broke into a run, finding a blonde girl sprawled in the dirt, surrounded by four other women.\n\u201cAre you all right?\u201d Rishe hurried over to help the girl up. Her maid\u2019s uniform\u2014a loose navy-blue dress with a white apron\u2014was smeared with mud. The others were dressed identically.\n\u201cWho are you?\u201d one of the girls snapped at Rishe. She had a mop of blazing-red hair. \u201cAnother newbie?\u201d\nAn understandable mistake. Rishe\u2019s dress was simple, free of ornamentation, and her hair was bound back in a ponytail to keep it out of the way. She was dust-streaked, sweaty, and carrying a bucket in her arms.\nTelling them who I am will be more trouble than it\u2019s worth. Her silence only angered the girls more.\n\u201cAre you one of the crown princess\u2019s maids? They\u2019ve been snatching up every new girl. Those pretty hands of yours don\u2019t look like they\u2019ve ever held a broom,\u201d said one of them.\n\u201cUnfortunately for you, we\u2019ve been working here three years, and we\u2019ll be the ones to serve Prince Arnold as the maids of his palace.\u201d\n\u201cCan you stand? Oh, good, it looks like you\u2019re not injured.\u201d Rishe helped the girl up out of the dirt. \n\u201cHey, don\u2019t ignore us!\u201d the redheaded maid shouted. \u201cYou\u2019ve got some nerve. If you want to make it here, you\u2019ll know your place! I doubt the two of you will last a week!\u201d\nRishe didn\u2019t respond, her attention snagging on something else. The redhead was carrying curtains, probably to bring them to the wash. Rishe stared at them so hard the maid began to shift uncomfortably. \u201cWhat\u2019s your problem?\u201d\n\u201cYou should wait to wash those,\u201d Rishe said.\nThe girl glared daggers at her. \u201cExcuse me? Are you telling me it\u2019s too late in the day? You really are an amateur! The light lasts longer in the spring, you know. And it\u2019s hot today. There\u2019ll be plenty of\u2014\u201d \n\u201cIt\u2019s going to rain, is all.\u201d\nThe maids exchanged glances. \u201cHow can you be so sure?\u201d\n\u201cLook at the clouds amassing. The butterflies and the bees are flying low. The moisture in the air will make the drying take longer.\u201d\n\u201cWhat?\u201d\nAnother maid spoke up in a soft voice. \u201cDiana, you were the one who said we should take the initiative to wash the bigger pieces. You said the crown prince would choose us for his household!\u201d\n\u201cStop putting the blame on me! This isn\u2019t my fault.\u201d An indignant flush crept over the redhead\u2019s face. \u201cThere\u2019s no way some upstart can tell what time it\u2019s going to rain! The weather is going to be fantastic all day. Come on, we\u2019re hauling these over to the wash!\u201d\nThe three girls meekly followed Diana.\nRishe sighed, turning to the blonde girl. \u201cAre you hurt?\u201d\n\u201cNo, I\u2019m fine.\u201d The girl\u2019s gaze darted around nervously. \u201cI\u2019m Elsie. Thank you for helping me.\u201d Her face was studiously blank, but from the way she struggled with her words, Rishe could tell she was being genuine.\n\u201cDon\u2019t worry about it,\u201d Rishe said. \u201cYour uniform seems to have fared less well.\u201d\n\u201cOh no.\u201d Elsie looked down at herself. Her face remained vacant, but she seemed sad. \u201cAnd I just got it.\u201d \n\u201cYou can get the dirt out if you wash it straight away. It\u2019s going to rain, but this dress should dry quickly. Use lots of soap, but don\u2019t scrub it by hand\u2014scrape the mud off with a brush.\u201d\n\u201cWhy a brush?\u201d\n\u201cBecause your fingers will just grind dirt into the threads. A brush is more porous.\u201d\nThe young sons of the family Rishe served spent their time tumbling in the dirt, and she had plenty of experience scraping mud out of clothes. She could even salvage dirty socks that had spent days crumpled in the corner.\n\u201cDo you\u2026 Are you\u2026\u201d Elsie trailed off, blinking rapidly a couple of times before finally looking Rishe in the eyes. \u201cAre you the crown princess\u2019s maid?\u201d\nUnsure how to answer, Rishe couldn\u2019t meet her eyes.\n \n***\n \nAfter parting ways with Elsie, Rishe returned to the detached wing with her fresh water. She put clean sheets on the bed the knights had installed, satisfied that she had a comfortable place to sleep. This room also had the highest-up balcony in the whole detached palace.\nTaking a break, she wandered out onto the balcony and looked off over the capital, the golden afternoon tinged with the onset of twilight. The day was fresh with a recent rain, the air clear enough to see for miles. The spring breeze felt good against her skin, sweaty from cleaning. Rishe leaned against the railing, leaning her head back and closing her eyes.\nShe felt like collapsing into bed immediately, but she desperately needed a wash. Still, she didn\u2019t want to pull herself away from the view and the breeze just yet. When she resumed gazing out absentmindedly, something her mother once said drifted back to her. \n\u201cRishe, there is no need for you to think for yourself.\u201d\nShe frowned, the memories coming thick and fast now.\n\u201cYou mustn\u2019t forget that the duty of our family is to live our lives fully devoted to the kings of the land. You\u2019re smart, but all the thinking in the world won\u2019t do a woman any good. You need only concern yourself with how best to serve the crown prince.\u201d\n\u201cStudies? Focus on social etiquette\u2014that\u2019s what you need for navigating high society. The crown prince\u2019s bride must be flawless. Your smile is lacking. You must always strive to appear amiable.\u201d\nRishe breathed out a long sigh. When I was fifteen, their lectures were the only thing I thought about.\nHer parents preached constantly. \u201cA woman\u2019s true happiness is to marry a suitable man and give birth to his heirs.\u201d\n\u201cBut, Mother\u2026\u201d\nObjection was not permitted. Any argument was immediately dispensed with. As a woman, Rishe could not inherit her father\u2019s title. Her only value was in her marriage. \nDespite knowing now that the opinions of others were as worthless as empty titles, the words still echoed in her memories.\nRishe\u2019s fingertips twitched, and she opened her eyes. Unmoving, she said, \u201cShouldn\u2019t you be seeing to your duties?\u201d\n\u201cMore hidden depths, I see,\u201d came a voice tinged with pleasure. Rishe straightened and turned. There was Arnold, leaning against the door to the balcony. \u201cYou seem able to sense my approach no matter how far or how hard I try.\u201d\n\u201cYou\u2019re quite naughty, aren\u2019t you? You\u2019ve been making your presence known little by little, emanating threat, to see how quickly I catch on.\u201d\n\u201cSo you noticed that as well.\u201d Arnold joined Rishe on the balcony. She tensed, but all he did was cast a curious glance at the view. \u201cWhat were you looking at?\u201d\n\u201cThe city.\u201d Rishe was hardly going to tell him she\u2019d been looking at nothing, merely ruminating on her mother\u2019s overbearing advice. The view from the balcony was spectacular, though. \u201cWhat\u2019s that over there?\u201d\n\u201cYou mean the library? The state invested funds to expand it. We have books from all over the world.\u201d\n\u201cReally? You have a library that big?\u201d Rishe\u2019s eyes sparkled with delight. She pointed out another building. \u201cWhat about that spire? It\u2019s beautiful.\u201d\n\u201cThe church and clock tower. The bells ring out the hour.\u201d\n\u201cOoh, how wonderful! And it looks like there\u2019s a rather big market there too?\u201d\n\u201cYes, the largest market in the city. Carts line up in the early morning. Most of the offerings are made fresh every day.\u201d\n\u201cAmazing! And what about that pretty mountain over there?\u201d\nRishe tried and failed to contain her excitement. She couldn\u2019t help but imagine what seeing all these places up close would be like. The grand library, the beautiful church that told the time, and the morning market with fresh, delicious food\u2014she wanted to experience it all.\nSeeing Arnold\u2019s bemused face, she said, \u201cWhat?\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m just wondering where all this interest is coming from,\u201d he said. \u201cYou were so reluctant to come, yet here you are, brimming with curiosity for my city.\u201d\n\u201cWell\u2026\u201d she trailed off, unsure of how to respond.\nWhat should I say? Should I just tell him the truth?\nThis wasn\u2019t a secret, but talking about her hopes and dreams to the man who had killed her was a little awkward. A strange self-consciousness settled on her, her cheeks heating as she mumbled, \u201cBecause I\u2019ve always wanted to.\u201d\nArnold looked at her keenly. \u201cWanted to what?\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019ve always wanted to come here.\u201d\nDuring her life as a merchant, Rishe developed her single dream to visit everywhere in the world. That dream was cut tragically short when only one country remained: Galkhein.\nIn each of her consecutive lives, Rishe\u2019s priority became staying alive. Every time, without fail, just as she found her footing, the world was plunged into chaos. She never had the chance to see Galkhein. This betrothal was her chance. \u201cIt\u2019s probably why I agreed to marry you,\u201d she added after a moment\u2019s hesitation.\nArnold swept a tepid glance over the city. \u201cThere\u2019s nothing here worth seeing.\u201d\n\u201cThat\u2019s not true! The places you just told me about sound amazing! Your citizens are clean and happy, your knights are proper and kind. Oh, and another\u2014\u201d \nRishe broke off enumerating Galkhein\u2019s charms as Arnold turned to look at her. His face was impassively calm, but something seemed to pass by underneath, like a shadow in deep water.\n\u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d Rishe said. \u201cDid I say something odd?\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m just amazed you could be so unaware of yourself.\u201d \nWh-what a rude thing to\u2014\n\u201cI\u2019ve never met anyone like you. No one has ever spoken to me the way you do. I don\u2019t know any girls of your class with the knowledge or the physical abilities you possess. Noblewomen don\u2019t concern themselves with such things.\u201d\nRishe, there is no need for you to think for yourself.\nShe frowned. \u201cPerhaps you\u2019re right, but everything I\u2019ve learned is precious to me. No one can take my skills away\u2014I value them with my life. Some may say that my knowledge is worthless, but it makes no difference to me.\u201d She turned from the balcony, fixing him with a piercing gaze. \u201cI\u2019m the one who decides what I value.\u201d\nRishe had clawed free of her mother and father\u2019s indoctrination a long time ago. Man, woman\u2014it didn\u2019t matter. She could do anything. Being queen was not the culmination of her life; she wouldn\u2019t trade her freedom for anything.\nArnold matched her intensity. \u201cYou\u2019re right.\u201d He gently cupped her cheek in a one hand, swiping his thumb along the line of her jaw, smearing dust. \u201cLive your life here however you wish. I vow to do my utmost to protect you.\u201d\n\u201cHuh?\u201d\nHis vehemence",
    "query_text": " took her by surprise. Arnold had every right to demand she act the part of a proper consort. This was a political marriage; Rishe was essentially a hostage, after all. Yet here he was, cosigning her misbehavior. Moreover, he was all but swearing to defend her from the consequences.\n\u201cWhy?\u201d\n\u201cYou know why."

    "prefix_text": " Have you always been a valet?\u201d\n\u201cI trained as a squire, actually,\u201d Oliver replied. \u201cBut I was injured and dismissed from the order. His Highness took me into his household soon after. I have served him for nearly a decade.\u201d\n\u201cThen maybe you can answer this,\u201d Rishe said. \u201cWhy is Prince Arnold so very intent on making me his wife?\u201d\nOliver hesitated, as if weighing the pros and cons of speaking, \u201cTo be quite honest, I was as surprised as you were. He\u2019s always insisted he had no interest in marriage. But the sight of you in Hermity has changed his mind. Apparently.\u201d\nSo not even his attendant understood his motives. Rishe remained at a complete loss.\n\u201cIf I may, however?\u201d Oliver mistook Rishe\u2019s confusion for anxiety and added, \u201cI have served Prince Arnold for a long time, and never before have I seen him so happy. When he is with you, he laughs. His smiles are sincere.\u201d\nRishe was taken aback. She\u2019d figured all of Arnold\u2019s laughter and teasing was at her expense. His own private jokes.\n\u201cAre you\u2026unhappy with him?\u201d Oliver ventured. \u201cWith his looks, His Highness is exceedingly popular with the ladies of the court, you know.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m sure he has many admirers.\u201d She paused. \u201cWould you really call the way he acts around me \u2018happy\u2019? To me, it seems more like a cat with a mouse.\u201d\nOliver laughed. He didn\u2019t deny it. \u201cI am pleased you understand His Highness so well. Oh, I nearly forgot. Here.\u201d\nHe held out a sheaf of three documents. \u201cThis is the guest list for your wedding. His Highness bids you look over it.\u201d\n\u201cThank you,\u201d Rishe said, pleasantly surprised. She hadn\u2019t even needed to ask. She gave it a quick glance, quickly identifying the most prominent and powerful names.\nKing Zahad, Prince Kyle, Princess Harriet. And from the Kingdom of Domana, we have Lord Jonal attending as the representative of the king. No surprise there.\nMore than a wedding guest register, this was a list of key people from the countries Arnold would go on to antagonize. Even before the murder of the king and the start of the war, there must have been a trigger\u2014a sea change in the affairs of state. Everyone on this list was most likely involved.\nKing Zahad. I hope we can be friends again like in my first life. Hmm\u2026 Prince Kyle is rather frail. I hope he isn\u2019t working himself too hard. He has a strong sense of responsibility\u2014he\u2019ll attend the wedding even though it\u2019ll be a long trip.\nThe sight of these names filled Rishe with a longing for those lives, for the people she\u2019d once known. And sometime in the very near future, they would all be Galkhein\u2019s enemies.\nIf I take matters into my own hands, perhaps I can salvage some of these relationships before they sour. Even if we aren\u2019t allies, we don\u2019t have to be enemies. Anything to stave off the outbreak of war.\nOliver had no idea what was going through Rishe\u2019s head. Brightly, he continued their conversation. \u201cThe ceremony will be held in three months\u2019 time. All preparations must be complete by then. And now\u2026we need to discuss tonight\u2019s party.\u201d\n\u201cTonight\u2019s what?\u201d\nOliver stiffened. \u201cDid His Highness not tell you?\u201d\n\u201cNo, he most certainly did not! There\u2019s to be a party?\u201d\n\u201cUgh, not again!\u201d Oliver dug his knuckles into his forehead.\nRishe put two and two together. She hesitated, then said, \u201cSo there is one, then. As you must know, His Highness is trying to stamp it down without telling me.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d Oliver replied. \u201cHe should have mentioned it to you. You don\u2019t need to attend, but he will. At least, I hope he will. I think I managed to convince him.\u201d\nShe sympathized with Oliver. Under normal circumstances, it would be unheard of for the crown prince and his fianc\u00e9e to fail to appear at a banquet. \u201cDon\u2019t worry, Oliver. I\u2019ll go.\u201d\nOliver let out a sigh of relief. \u201cReally? Thank you so much, my lady. I\u2019ll put finding you a maid at the top of my to-do list.\u201d\n\u201cNo need.\u201d Rishe smiled. \u201cI can prepare for the party on my own.\u201d\nThis maid-selection process made Rishe uneasy. After witnessing that exchange between the servants in the garden, she imagined quarrels breaking out all through the palace. And she doubted the disputes would go away even after they decided.\nOliver frowned. \u201cBut won\u2019t dressing be difficult without a lady\u2019s maid?\u201d \nShe shook her head. \u201cI can do my hair and put on a gown by myself. I brought dresses and cosmetics from home. Don\u2019t worry.\u201d\nRishe ignored Oliver\u2019s stunned look, already reevaluating her cleaning plans.\n \n***\n \nThe first thing Rishe said to Arnold that night was, \u201cYour Highness, I have a request.\u201d Her gown rustled as she leaned in close. \u201cI would like some herb seed and a corner of the gardens. I made a list. I hope we can discuss this in more detail later.\u201d\nArnold was silent a moment. \u201cRishe.\u201d\n\u201cWhat? Didn\u2019t you tell me to let you know if there was anything I wanted?\u201d She looked at him quizzically, and Arnold sighed.\nShe\u2019d heard that he\u2019d finished his mountain of work and even managed to sleep for a while. He was dressed in his usual military black, trimmed with a red mantle and black gloves.\nArnold shook his head. \u201cThat\u2019s not what I mean. I\u2019m guessing that Oliver didn\u2019t tell you the reason for this party? It\u2019s merely for appearance\u2019s sake. I need to look like I\u2019m searching for a bride within our borders as well. There\u2019s no reason for you to attend.\u201d\nIt made sense. The crown prince\u2014the greatest catch in the kingdom\u2014marrying a foreigner without even the slightest nod to propriety would invite unwanted discontent from the nobility.\n\u201cHowever, we\u2019re betrothed,\u201d Arnold said. \u201cThis whole evening is merely a formality. And with news that you\u2019re my \u2018hostage\u2019 going around, you\u2019ll be an object of curiosity. I don\u2019t want to put you through that.\u201d\n\u201cWell, I already went to the trouble of getting ready.\u201d Rishe plucked at her soft blue dress, draped in fluttering layers around her like a flower bud. She\u2019d braided her hair, decorating it with accessories. Her makeup was light, her shoes polished to a mirror shine. Her only jewelry was a pair of pearl earrings.\n\u201cRishe\u2026\u201d\n\u201cYour Highness, the court may consider my status as a captive princess shameful in the extreme, but I don\u2019t.\u201d She\u2019d chosen this course, after all.\nArnold was again watching her with a mixture of wonder and confusion.\n\u201cSo don\u2019t worry,\u201d she said, extending her hand. \u201cFeel free to show off your fianc\u00e9e.\u201d\nArnold relented, his dashing smile creeping out once again. \u201cVery well. I should take advantage of this opportunity to touch my betrothed.\u201d\n\u201cWe\u2019re wearing gloves.\u201d\nArnold took Rishe\u2019s hand.\nA throng of guests was gathered in the ballroom as a group of musicians performed on a platform. Women in gowns stood clustered, while gentlemen in military attire grouped together. A mere glance was enough to tell their clothes were of the highest quality. They mingled happily, making small talk with glasses in hand.\nRishe let her hand rest on Arnold\u2019s arm as she paused at the threshold to take it all in. \u201cThis is a bigger event than I was expecting.\u201d\n\u201cIs it? I\u2019d say it\u2019s a rather small gathering, actually.\u201d\n\u201cMaybe for a military powerhouse,\u201d Rishe muttered. \nYet another reminder of Galkhein\u2019s wealth took her off guard. Arnold just looked bored.\n\u201cThe size doesn\u2019t matter,\u201d he said. \u201cIn the end, they\u2019re only here for gossip. Look, here they come.\u201d\nIn the blink of",
    "query_text": " an eye, they were surrounded by guests.\n\u201cPrince Arnold, thank you for gracing us with an invitation,\u201d said one man. \u201cSuch a pleasure.\u201d \n\u201cThe pleasure is mine, Lord Abel,\u201d Arnold drawled.\n\u201cYour Highness! We were so glad to hear of your safe return,\u201d another guest chirped. \u201cPlease, our daughter is simply dying to be regaled with tales of your trip.\u201d\n\u201cI can\u2019t imagine I\u2019d have anything particularly exciting to share with her,\u201d Arnold said curtly.\nAfter the last few days, Rishe found this look of glazed apathy disturbing. His good looks only compounded it\u2014he was so handsome that every expression was stark.\nHe looks more like Emperor Arnold Hein now, but still not the same.\nArnold appeared to notice her watching him. When he looked at her, his sourness disappeared, replaced by a genuine smile. All around him, women found themselves flushing. Arnold paid"

Never mind! Maybe I should just take that\u2014oh no!\u201d\nRishe ignored the ashen-faced Cornelia, raising the glass and swallowing down a gulp. \n\u201cI-I can\u2019t believe\u2026\u201d\n\u201cSuch a spicy flavor, just as I imagined.\u201d Rishe smiled again to the assembled group\u2019s astonishment. \u201cWhat a warm welcome. I do hope the two of us can spend more time together. Perhaps\u2026a tea party?\u201d\n\u201cTh-the two of us?\u201d Cornelia stammered.\n\u201cYes. I want to know all about House Toona.\u201d\nCornelia looked flabbergasted, but she recovered herself and nodded.\nThat should do. One of Rishe\u2019s eventual plans required a plot of land in a temperate climate. House Toona\u2019s would likely be perfect, but she needed to confirm a few things with Cornelia. Never back down from a fight. Even further\u2026\nShe recalled the words of her mentor from her days as a merchant.\nDon\u2019t bother with fights you can\u2019t win.\nThe other ladies fled, fearful of this strange girl who gulped down painfully spicy wine like it was nothing. \n \n***\n \nRishe retreated to the empty balcony to enjoy the music, grimacing with every stinging mouthful of wine. She drank it in decreasing sips until Arnold joined her.\n\u201cWhat are you making that face for?\u201d\nRishe swirled the glass. \u201cDon\u2019t worry, it\u2019s not you. It\u2019s just this wine is so spicy.\u201d\n\u201cSpicy? The wine is?\u201d\n\u201cMm. It\u2019s seasoned with capsicum. I barely managed to get that first mouthful down without gagging.\u201d\nArnold swiped the glass from her hand. \u201cDon\u2019t tell me this was a poisoning attempt!\u201d\nRishe clicked her tongue in annoyance at her own lack of vigilance. No one else would be able to grab something from her so easily.\nArnold glared at the wine. \u201cYou don\u2019t need to drink this. I\u2019ll get rid of it.\u201d\n\u201cHey, give that back! They ruined a perfectly good glass of wine because of me. I\u2019m not going to waste it.\u201d She grabbed it back and took another sip, shuddering at the taste.\nArnold glowered. \u201cTell me who did this. I\u2019ll have them executed.\u201d\n\u201cDon\u2019t be ridiculous. You don\u2019t kill people like her\u2014you use them.\u201d Just the tiniest bit of wine to go, but it was getting harder to make herself drink it. She gave the glass a reproachful look, then glanced back at Arnold. \u201cOh, and I owe you an apology.\u201d\n\u201cDo you?\u201d\n\u201cI used your name to defend myself.\u201d The girls had only backed off when she threatened to tattle to Arnold. Rishe found that sort of thing inelegant in the extreme, and she was embarrassed.\nArnold sighed at Rishe\u2019s apologetic bow. \u201cThere\u2019s nothing wrong with a wife invoking her husband\u2019s name.\u201d\nRishe hesitated. \u201cWe\u2019re not married yet.\u201d\n\u201cThat\u2019s a formality. It\u2019s as good as done, if you ask me.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2026see.\u201d\nHe took her distraction as an opportunity to swipe her glass back. Instead of dumping it out, Arnold gulped the rest of it down. \n\u201cDamn, that packs a punch,\u201d he grumbled.\n\u201cI told you that!\u201d Rishe snapped. \u201cAre you all right? Let me get you some water!\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m fine. But now you\u2019ve fulfilled your obligation to the wine, haven\u2019t you?\u201d\nRishe didn\u2019t know what to say. He\u2019d helped her\u2014not by taking charge but by following her lead. Without cutting her down and telling her she was being foolish. Without rolling his eyes and dismissing her desires as trifles.\n\u201cThank you,\u201d Rishe said stiffly, which just made him laugh.\n\u201cWhat were you thinking about when we were dancing?\u201d he asked.\n\u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d\n\u201cYou were thinking about someone else, weren\u2019t you? Who?\u201d\nRishe didn\u2019t know a delicate way to say I was thinking about a future version of you I met in another life.\n\u201cHmm?\u201d His tone was oddly light, teasing even. But the gleam in his hunter\u2019s eyes said she wouldn\u2019t get away so easily.\nObviously, Rishe couldn\u2019t give him an honest answer. \u201cI wasn\u2019t thinking about anyone else. I was worried about you.\u201d\n\u201cWhy?\u201d\nThis was the closest she could come to the truth. \u201cWere you injured here?\u201d She patted her own left shoulder with her forefinger. \nArnold went silent. His left shoulder was slightly slower to react than his right\u2014if his right was at one hundred, then his left was at maybe ninety-eight. It was hardly noticeable, but Rishe had picked up on it. He was right-handed, and she wouldn\u2019t have noticed it if they\u2019d been dancing normally. \nThat, and if it hadn\u2019t been for memories from her past life.\nRishe had only managed to inflict a single injury on him. An instant, a moment\u2019s hesitation where she saw her chance and slashed left. Of course, he\u2019d shrugged off the injury and effortlessly run her through. \n\u201cHeh.\u201d Arnold finally broke his silence with grim laughter. His eyes sent shivers down her spine, cold and bewitching. In lieu of an answer, he reached for his collar, unfastening the clasp with a snap and drawing his jacket open with a rough tug.\nOh my.\nRishe drew in a breath. A great scar was engraved into the nape of his neck, just low enough to be concealed by clothing. It looked several years old. \u201cIt\u2019s an old wound. It continues to the top of my shoulder and pulls the skin taut.\u201d\n\u201cHow awful.\u201d Rishe couldn\u2019t help but reach out to gingerly touch the nape of his neck.\nArnold accepted her touch without a word. She\u2019d half expected to be slapped aside.\nHer fingers slowly traced the shape of it. She could feel the rough skin through her gloves.\nHe must have gotten this over a decade ago. Someone stabbed him\u2014and not just once or twice. They must have done it over and over to make this scar pattern.\nHer medical training had her shuddering at the image of a nine-year-old Arnold ashen and trembling with blood loss. The fact that he\u2019d survived and retained the use of his arm was incredible. And then to go on to wield a sword so skillfully\u2014his suffering must have been immense.\n\u201cOnly a few people know about this injury. You\u2019re the first to notice on your own.\u201d\n\u201cHow did it happen?\u201d\nThat grim smile returned as he looked down at Rishe. With the moon hanging behind him, he was as opaque as ever, but Rishe understood the sentiment.\nI shouldn\u2019t pry.\nRishe pulled her hand away, and that ominous smile that sent chills down her spine disappeared. Arnold put his jacket back in order, reclasping it at the neck.\nSomeone tried to kill Arnold Hein about ten years ago. But who and why? Rishe cast her eyes down as she ruminated. The most obvious beneficiaries of a dead crown prince would be potential heirs and those loyal to them. I believe Arnold has a younger brother, but I haven\u2019t met him yet.\nOdd. Rishe might be a hostage, but shouldn\u2019t she meet her future relatives? Perhaps it was Arnold\u2019s doing and not the will of the imperial family themselves. He didn\u2019t seem to want to involve her in anything unless it was absolutely necessary\u2014he hadn\u2019t told her about this ball, after all. \nRishe looked up at him. \u201cYour Highness, may I select my maids some time over the next few days?\u201d \n\u201cVery well. I\u2019ll tell Oliver to make that a priority.\u201d\n\u201cAh, I can do the selection myself. We needn\u2019t trouble him.\u201d\nArnold arched an amused brow. Gone was that unsettling smile, replaced with his easy manner. \u201cWhat are you planning this time?\u201d\n\u201cOh, nothing important,\u201d Rishe said. She picked up her empty glass. \u201cI\u2019m merely concerned about the servants\u2019 working conditions.\u201d\nTo protect her life and well-being, she needed to keep from dying at twenty years old again. And to do that, she had to prevent Arnold Hein\u2019s war. Her best bet would be to appeal to the important people she\u2019d known in her past lives. People with influence.\nPlus, there was a mountain of things she needed to do in preparation for the marriage ceremony.\nI need to sow a plot of land, grow herbs, do lots of shopping, get cheap alcohol, and then\u2026 \nRishe began a to-do list that had nothing to do with war in the least.\n \n***\n \nAs the ball wound to a close, a lone boy stood in the gloomy courtyard of the imperial palace. He had soft black hair and round blue eyes. No older than sixteen, he had an androgynous grace to him, gaze fixed on the balcony above. \nHe was watching a girl.\nShe had coral-colored hair, and even from this distance, he could tell she was beautiful. She stood there alone, apparently waiting for someone. Whoever it was must have shown up because her hand slipped from the banister, and she stepped away. Not too long after, a man appeared where she had been standing.\nThe man turned a silent glare down into the garden, as if he\u2019d known the boy had been there the whole time, despite the shadows.\nA shiver ran down the boy\u2019s spine and he smiled reflexively, delighting in the intense aura of threat the man gave off. It was just a warning, it seemed, as the man abruptly turned on his heel and disappeared. \n\u201cAww, we can\u2019t play together either?\u201d The boy hung his head. \u201cI miss you, Brother.\u201d\nIt had to be the woman. The beauty. She\u2019d made the boy\u2019s life hell since the day she arrived. \nHis brother had prohibited him from attending balls like this one. That was fine; he\u2019d sooner avoid them altogether. Still, he\u2019d wanted to meet that girl. \n\u201cBut we\u2019ll meet soon enough, won\u2019t we?\u201d He spoke to himself in a soft voice. \u201cI\u2019ve got plans",

Rishe was once again dressed to fit in with the maids. At Diana\u2019s shout, she looked up without pausing in her work. \n\u201cIs even laundry beyond your capabilities? I asked you to wash these this morning"

Hopefully now she would understand how much of an edge her privileged literacy gave her over the other maids.\n\u201cEveryone else works as hard as they can, just like you do,\u201d Rishe said. \u201cRemember how it was for you at first? They all have to start somewhere. I hope you\u2019ll keep that in mind.\u201d\n\u201cThey\u2019re no different from me,\u201d Diana mumbled begrudgingly, glancing around the room, looking at the less experienced maids. As if coming to a decision, she said, \u201cI\u2019m sorry.\u201d\n\u201cDiana?\u201d\nLike a child enumerating her regrets, Diana went on, \u201cI\u2019ve done you wrong, all of you. It\u2019s just, I had nothing. Or so it felt like. No money, no title. I thought I had to make my way in the world on my own. That I had to start from zero.\u201d Her shoulders trembled as she buried her face in her hands. \u201cBut I was wrong! I wasn\u2019t starting from zero. I had everything that I learned growing up. I didn\u2019t realize how fortunate I was. I let it all go to my he\n \n\u201cRISHE IRMGARD WEITZNER! You are a vile woman! A truly malicious creature unworthy of the crown prince! As of this instant, our engagement is off!\u201d \n\u201cAs you wish, Your Highness.\u201d\n\u201c\u2026Huh?\u201d\nThe prince\u2019s declaration echoed throughout the ballroom. Rishe, the duke\u2019s daughter, bowed in response, her coral-toned hair swaying gracefully. The assembled guests found themselves captivated by her dignified beauty. Despite having just witnessed a broken engagement, they couldn\u2019t bring themselves to pity her.\nSlowly, Rishe lifted her head and fixed the prince with a pale-emerald gaze. It caught him off guard, but he quickly recovered.\n\u201cDidn\u2019t you hear what I just said?! I\u2019m calling off our engagement! Doesn\u2019t that trouble you?\u201d\n\u201cNot really.\u201d\nRishe already knew what happened next: false accusations, exile, and her family severing all ties and leaving her to survive on her own. She turned from the prince. There was no point wasting any time.\nThis is my seventh loop, after all.\nRishe had done this all before.\nThe next few hours will be busy. I must hurry and retrieve my things before I\u2019m barred from the family estate. I don\u2019t want this to be one of the times I\u2019m too slow and I have to start my new life with nothing.\n\u201cRishe, halt and hear me! I have spent the past week perfecting my recitation of your crimes!\u201d\nI should take more than dresses this time\u2014there\u2019s plenty of things I could use out in the world. What trade should I take up? In my first life, I was a merchant. In my second, an apothecary. I\u2019ve got a few more I want to try out\u2026 Augh! If time\u2019s just going to keep resetting, I wish I could start at an earlier point. I need more time to prepare!\n\u201cWait! Rishe!\u201d\nThe crown prince was on the verge of tears, and the spectators struggled to suppress their snickers. \nA thought occurred to Rishe, and she stopped. She then turned, her eyes gleaming beneath long lashes as she stared down her ex-fianc\u00e9. \u201cAh, Your Highness, I almost forgot.\u201d \n\u201cYes, tell me!\u201d the prince fumed. \u201cLet me guess, you are hurt beyond measure and yet love me still\u2026correct?\u201d\nAs if. Rishe was grateful to be granted her freedom. In fact, she was smiling as she said, \u201cI hope you and Lady Mary are happy together.\u201d\n\u201cWhat?!\u201d\n\u201cMay we both lead fulfilling lives. Farewell!\u201d Rishe lifted the skirts of her evening gown and turned on her heel, departing as briskly as she could.\n\u201cHow do you know about Mary? I haven\u2019t told you I love her!\u201d The prince was shouting something behind her, but she paid him no mind. She had things to do.\nDuring her first loop, the prince\u2019s accusations had shocked her to the core and she\u2014foolishly so\u2014had attempted to defend herself. Now she knew better than to expect the prince to behave reasonably. \nHow will life unfold this time? I\u2019m excited to find out! Rishe fixed her mind on the future.\nThis is my seventh \u201cdo-over.\u201d I\u2019ve led happy and carefree lives before, but this time\u2014this time, I swear I\u2019ll live a long happy and carefree life!\nIn other words, she needed to avoid getting killed. At any cost. \n \n***\n \nIn the first loop, with her engagement broken and her reputation in tatters, Rishe roamed with nothing but the clothes on jewelry. Finding them a good-natured band, she hitched a ride to a neighboring country.\nFrom the merchant caravan, she learned a trade, studying how to procure stock and balance ledgers. Eventually, she set out on her own to travel the world. Her upbringing as a daughter of the nobility meant that, even at fifteen years old, Rishe possessed a keen sense for beauty.\nShe collected things that caught her eye and sold them to whoever found delight in her wares. Before she realized it, she had become a major vendor, employing a full staff. She had even done business with the king of a desert nation and the prince of a frozen country up north. She traveled to many distant places, realizing a dream born from her cossetted former life spent doing nothing but preparing to be queen.\nFive years passed, and just as she had only one country left to visit, Rishe fell victim to the war sweeping across the continent.\nThe next thing she knew, she was fifteen years old again and back at that party, with the prince poised to make his pronouncement.\n\u201cRishe Irmgard Weitzner! You are a vile woman! A truly malicious creature unworthy of the crown prince! As of this instant, our engagement is off!\u201d\nNaturally, she didn\u2019t understand what was going on at first. She looked around. Everything was the same. She stood in the same place wearing the same dress and draped in the same jewelry she\u2019d sold to the caravan.\nWas it a dream? Or was everything that had happened up until then the dream? In her confusion, all she could do was stare.\nRishe hurried out of the ballroom, the impending threat of exile hanging over her and the prince\u2019s entreaties to halt ringing in her ears.\nThis is perfect! Now I can get it right! I\u2019ll grab everything valuable from my room.\nRishe had enjoyed her life as a merchant, but she had always felt a stirring of regret about this night. If only she\u2019d brought some funds from home, she would\u2019ve had the capital to establish her business much sooner!\nSpeaking of this regret always prompted disbelief from her customers, including the king of the desert. \u201cWhat? That\u2019s what you\u2019d want to do over?!\u201d\nWhen she arrived back at home on the night of her second life, Rishe grabbed her jewelry box and as many of the books her late grandmother had left her as she could carry, then made haste to the forest to meet the caravan. But the stop at her house took time, and she missed them completely.\nIn that moment, Rishe made a stark realization. Different choices meant different mistakes. Opening one door would close another.\nAnd so the easy path to a life in commerce was closed to her.\nSure, she could try to build her business from the ground up, but personal connections were almost as essential to being a merchant as business savvy. It just wasn\u2019t realistic without a single acquaintance. \nSorting through her belongings in resignation, she came across a foreign encyclopedia of herbs among her grandmother\u2019s books. Taking it as a sign, Rishe sold her jewels elsewhere and used the funds to cross the sea and pursue the study of medicine.\nFortunately, Rishe retained all her knowledge from her previous life. She remembered that certain expensive herbs could be acquired cheaply in other regions. When word spread of a disease running rampant in a neighboring country, she recalled that too. This foreknowledge proved invaluable, as did her wide travel and exposure to many different teachers with many different points of view.\nAs such, Rishe led a successful life as an apothecary. She saved a feeble prince, synthesized a number of rare medicines with her mercantile knowledge, and thus spent her days in the simple joy of helping those in need.\nUnfortunately, all the joy in the world couldn\u2019t stand up to an epidemic. Thus ended her second life. \nOnce again, she found herself in the moment of her broken engagement, the curtain rising on the third loop. Her next four lives proceeded much the same way. As a skilled lady\u2019s maid, she helped a young noblewoman to a fortuitous marriage. Once, she even disguised herself as a man and became a knight. Every life was worth living, and she enjoyed them all. She enjoyed living, period.\nThere was just one problem.\nNo matter what I do, I die at twenty.\nShe enjoyed her lives, but she was not permitted to do so for long. With this time limit always hanging over her, she spent each loop in a state of constant activity.\nI would love to take it easy for a while. Is a little leisure time too much to ask? Obviously I don\u2019t want to die either! This time, I\u2019ll make as much money as I can in the first five years. Then, when I turn twenty, I\u2019ll live a life free of worldly cares. I\u2019ll do whatever\u2019s necessary to stay alive!\nHer mind made up, Rishe began her seventh life in a dead sprint through the palace. Regardless of her future plans, she was in a race against time. She needed to beat the messenger bearing news of her scandal.\nAs she ran, she yanked off her hair ornaments; she planned to sell them and didn\u2019t want to risk losing one. Her hair billowed out behind her, falling in loose waves.\nSuddenly, an idea occurred to her, one she hadn\u2019t had in any of her previous six lives.\nLeaving through the palace gardens would be faster. I can climb down a tree from the balcony.\nRishe had gone to war as a knight in the life just before this one. After the punishing battlefield training, climbing trees was nothing.\nSeamlessly, she changed direction. She raced for the balcony, where she ran into something at full speed.\n\u201cBwargh!\u201d Rishe let out a very unladylike grunt, staggering a few steps. She looked up to see what she\u2019d bounced off of. \u201cOh\u2026\u201d\nAn exceptionally handsome man stood in her path.\nHe had refined, patrician features and cruel, thin lips. He was slender yet powerful; even through his clothes, Rishe could tell his body was well conditioned. His jet-black hair covered his ears, creeping down to the nape of his neck. The tips of his locks bounced with his movements. They looked to be soft to the touch.\nFrom head to toe, he was a pleasure to look at\u2014but what held Rishe\u2019s attention were his eyes. They were long in shape and impossibly blue, but they possessed a blade-sharp intensity. His gaze was clear, beautiful, and cold as ice. His eyelashes cast shadows on his striking face. He was a work of art.\nCurrently, this work of art was staring her down with a look that could kill.\nHe laughed. \u201cYou barreled right into me. For a moment, I thought I\u2019d been attacked by a wild boar.\u201d\nIt was an exceedingly rude thing to say to a stranger, but as luck would have it, this man was not a stranger. At least not to Rishe.\n\u201cWhat are you even doing here?\u201d the man went on. \u201cThe party is in the\u2014\u201d\nRishe interrupted him with a wordless shout of dismay. The man drew back, reflexively reaching for his sword. He composed himself with visible difficulty. \u201cWho are you? You look like any noblewoman, but your manner is\u2026\u201d \n\u201cEmperor Arnold Hein!\u201d \nThe man\u2019s eyes widened. He didn\u2019t mistake her surging contempt. Rishe had crossed swords with this man. Recently. He was the one responsible for ending her sixth life. \nHe must be a guest at the banquet. It makes sense.\nArnold Hein was the scion of a",

He\u2019d gathered elites from far and wide to introduce to his beloved Mary.\nThe man eyed Rishe with rising curiosity. \u201cYou know me? This is my first time in Hermity.\u201d\nUh-oh. Rishe pasted on a smile as her mind spun in circles. This man was dangerous. She had to avoid entanglements with him at all costs. Five years from now, Arnold Hein would invade Hermity. \nHe was an extraordinarily skilled swordsman and, with a powerful military at his back, was destined to conquer"

Even now, you bravely stand before me to protect the prince.\u201d\nMary\u2019s eyes were wide with confusion. Rishe picked her words carefully, attempting to diminish the girl\u2019s guilty feelings, if only a little. \u201cYou need to marry the prince for your family\u2019s sake, right?\u201d\n\u201cHow do you\u2014?\u201d\nRishe had learned this truth in one of her past lives. Mary was born to a poor family, and she had studied like mad to be accepted into the academy to hunt for a husband. She intended to make sure neither she nor her brothers ever went hungry again.\nShe went on, \u201cRemember this: you are the one in control of your life. Don\u2019t sell it to anyone else. Can you trust a man who so easily discards the woman he\u2019s been engaged to since childhood? Do you truly believe he cares for you?\u201d\nAstonishment bloomed across Mary\u2019s face. She looked over at Dietrich, who hadn\u2019t bothered to stand up. The truth was\u2026within a year, Prince Dietrich would be in prison, his title stripped from him. He would plan a mad coup d\u2019\u00e9tat against the king, attempting to provoke the citizens to war. His plan would be discovered in its early stages, rendering him a laughingstock across the kingdom.\n\u201cYou must shape your future with your own hands\u2014you mustn\u2019t entrust your desires to others.\u201d \n\u201cMy\u2026my desires?\nRishe nodded.\nMary was looking at her like she was speaking a foreign language. \u201cBut I\u2019m their elder sister.\u201d Her voice quivered. \u201cI must endure, no matter what. Otherwise, my brothers will never be happy.\u201d\n\u201cAnd you believe their happiness can only be achieved by sacrificing your own?\u201d\nMary gasped as she gaped at Rishe.\n\u201cYou don\u2019t need to throw away your own future to protect those you love,\u201d Rishe told her. \u201cNo matter what path you choose, never forget that.\u201d\n\u201cMy future?\u201d Mary\u2019s voice went ragged, like she was barely suppressing a wail of pain.\n\u201cI wish you a life where both you and your family can be happy,\u201d said Rishe.\nMary stood frozen in place, eyes gleaming like precious stones. Rishe couldn\u2019t help but admire how pretty she was. She truly did wish her happiness. But right now, she needed to take care of herself. \n\u201cWell.\u201d Rishe suddenly broke into a smile, making Dietrich flinch. \u201cI think it\u2019s time for me to be on my way.\u201d\nShe regretted losing access to her room, but she knew her parents wouldn\u2019t let her in. Turning her back on the crowd, Rishe contemplated her next move.\n\u201cWait, Lady Rishe!\u201d Mary\u2019s voice rang out.\n\u201cThat\u2019s right. You\u2019re not going anywhere, Rishe!\u201d The prince joined her. \u201cYou won\u2019t get away with treating me like trash to relieve your own injured heart.\u201d\n\u201cUgh, enough already!\u201d Rishe\u2019s patience was fraying. \u201cI don\u2019t have anything else to say to you. Goodbye!\u201d\n\u201cKnights, stop her!\u201d\nReluctantly, the knights moved to tail Rishe as she walked briskly back down the path. She sympathized with them, but she wasn\u2019t about to let them keep her here. Rounding a corner, she sensed something uncanny. She stopped, the knights quickly catching up with her.\n\u201cMy apologies, Lady Rishe. If you could please remain for just a\u2014whoa!\u201d\nRishe grabbed the hilt of the knight\u2019s sword. Yanking it from his belt, she spun around and stood at the ready. Metal rang against metal as Rishe parried a blow. She glared at her would-be attacker as he stepped out of the shadows.\nArnold Hein!\n\u201cWell, what do you know.\u201d The man smiling so sweetly while their swords locked was the very man who had ended her life. \u201cYou do have some skill.\u201d\nMetal screeched and slid, before Arnold sheathed his sword. Rishe lowered hers. Neither looked away.\n\u201cWho the hell are you?\u201d demanded one of the knights.\n\u201cStand down, good sirs,\u201d Rishe said. \u201cYour interference will only make this worse.\u201d\nThis mostly served to befuddle the knights further. Rishe absolutely couldn\u2019t allow them to come to blows with the crown prince of a friendly nation. And they couldn\u2019t beat him\u2014not even if they took him all at once. Rishe had blocked his blow, but her arm was completely numb. To think he\u2019d be even more powerful in five years.\nHe regarded her unabashedly. \u201cRishe, was that your name? Where did you learn such swordsmanship?\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m afraid I cannot say. Besides, you were clearly going easy on me.\u201d\n\u201cHa! You could tell?\u201d\nArnold\u2019s manner was throwing her off. He seemed to be enjoying himself. He\u2019s laughing. This monstrous prince is\u2026actually laughing.\nWhen she had met him in her other life, he was cold and merciless, like a genuine monster. And yet here he stood, mellow and smiling.\nThe Emperor Arnold Hein I knew was twenty-four years old, so he\u2019s, what? Nineteen now? This is so weird. He\u2019s grinning like a boy getting into a scrape.\nThat attack had been good-natured as well, almost playful. It had muscle behind it but certainly not any lethal intent. He\u2019d just wanted to force Rishe to catch the blow. She found it unbelievable that he could exude such an overpowering air of menace when he was just messing around.\nWhile Rishe was focused on Arnold, Mary and Dietrich caught up, seemingly recovered.\n\u201cExcuse me, my lord!\u201d Mary squeaked. \u201cI-I-I don\u2019t know who you are, but kindly step away from Lady Rishe!\u201d\n\u201cYes, do as she says! Who the hell are you, anyway?!\u201d\nDon\u2019t tell me Prince Dietrich doesn\u2019t recognize one of his personal guests.\nDietrich\u2019s interests did not lean toward diplomacy; he likely hadn\u2019t bothered to introduce himself to Arnold. Mary, for her part, seemed to grasp that Arnold wasn\u2019t ordinary. She stood up to defend Rishe, despite the tremble in her voice. In a better world, perhaps the two of them could have become friends.\n\u201cThat\u2019s your ex-fianc\u00e9?\u201d Arnold cocked a brow. \u201cHe\u2019s even worse than I imagined. Pathetic.\u201d\nDietrich flushed. \u201cI\u2019ll have your head!\u201d\n\u201cDietrich, I beg of you, contain yourself,\u201d Rishe said, then rounded on Arnold. \u201cAs for you, Your Highness\u2014you know who Dietrich is, and you know what speaking carelessly could mean. Are you trying to pick a fight?\u201d\n\u201cWhatever do you mean?\u201d Arnold\u2019s brows lifted high, making him the picture of innocence. \u201cBelieve me, Lady Rishe, every word I speak is chosen with extreme care.\u201d\nFinally realizing who Arnold was, Dietrich visibly paled. \u201cArnold? He\u2019s the crown prince of Galkhein?\u201d\nMary yelped. The knights stood down, shamefaced. The gossip-hungry neighbors who\u2019d gathered to witness a scandal play out drew back in fear.\n\u201cHe\u2019s the demon prince? The one who single-handedly destroyed a whole order of enemy knights?\u201d\n\u201cWatch your tongue, fool! Do you want him to do the same to you?\u201d\nThe two nations enjoyed peaceful relations, but Arnold remained the dreaded prince, heir to the throne of a former enemy. Current rumor wasn\u2019t as widespread as it would be in five years, but he was still regarded with distrust.\nThe onlookers stood rooted to the spot, too terrified to flee.\nWell, this has devolved into a full-fledged disaster.\nRishe heaved a frustrated sigh. \u201cPrince Arnold, to what do we owe this honor? Surely a crown prince would not draw his sword for a mere jest.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m here on business,\u201d Arnold said. \u201cBut first, I must beg forgiveness for my rudeness.\u201d\nHuh, what do you know? Once he became emperor, he\u2019d gladly behead any subject who so much as dared speak a word against him.\nI guess at nineteen he still knew how to apologize.\nIf that surprised her, Arnold\u2019s next act completely obliterated her sense of reality. \nWith a flourish, he fell to his knees. \n\u201cHuh?\u201d Is this actually happening? \nHe was a man destined for an imperial crown. A man who would stand at the head of a military powerhouse and spread his rule across continents.\nArnold, known for his frigid pride, knelt to the disgraced daughter of a duke.\nAnd not only that\u2014his head was bowed, looking nothing so much as a knight swearing allegiance to his lady. If it were anyone else, it would be a delightful, pious image. Instead, the assembled looked on in terrified awe.\nNot Rishe, though.\n\u201cWhat are you doing?\u201d she hissed. \u201cGet up!\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m apologizing for my baseless impertinence. Also, I\u2019m asking you\u2026\u201d He trailed off to take Rishe\u2019s hand, tugging her forward so forcefully she staggered. He gazed up at her.\nUgh. He\u2019s so beautiful. No matter how many times she looked at him, it didn\u2019t become any less disarming. Long eyelashes, arched brows, a noble nose. His bright blue eyes reminded her of the drift ice she\u2019d seen in a northern kingdom, gazing out from a ship in one of her past lives. She knew she was dwelling on this to buy time, even as the reality before her sank in.\n\u201c\u2026to become my wife.\u201d\nShe froze, unable to process the words. \u201cWhat?\u201d Rishe glanced around, desperately searching the faces of the crowd. They all seemed as stunned as she felt. She looked down at Arnold again. \u201cYour wife?\u201d \n\u201cYes, that\u2019s right.\u201d\n\u201cYou want me to become your wife?\u201d\n\u201cYes.\u201d\nRishe couldn\u2019t speak. This was truly happening. It was real. It clicked into place in her head, and she let out a strangled grunt.\nWhat is going on? Why is this happening?\nShock lapped at her, fuzzing at the corners of her vision. He wanted to marry her. Arnold wanted to marry Rishe. Her murderer wanted to marry her.\nWhy is he doing this? He must have some ulterior motive, a broader goal. But I have to give him an answer.\nThe onlookers were holding their breath as Rishe said flatly, \u201cI reject your proposal.\u201d\nArnold said nothing.\nShe had to reject him. She was going to live a long, peaceful, carefree life, damn it, and no one would stop her. And yet\u2026\nArnold began to laugh, and the deep, creeping sense of dread inside Rishe only grew. Why does he seem so amused by this?!\n \n***\n \nHer previous life was her sixth. Disguised as a man, Rishe rose as a warrior of an island country she came upon in her travels. It was a conventional yet charming kingdom formed of red brick. After striking up a friendship with a group of knights who didn\u2019t realize she was a woman, Rishe followed their advice and joined them.\nThe training was grueling enough to make her wish she were dead. Back when she had lived as a noble, she\u2019d learned how to wield a sword for basic self-defense, but training as a noble lady had in no way prepared her for this. She drilled relentlessly, barely taking the time to sleep. Just as she became a full-fledged knight, Emperor Arnold\u2019s forces lay siege to the castle.\n \n***\n \nHow could this happen? \nIn her seventh life, Rishe wearily sank into her chair. Across from her sat Arnold, his legs crossed and chin propped up on his hand, watching her lazily.\n\u201cWhat\u2019s the matter?\u201d he asked. \u201cYou seem unhappy.\u201d\n\u201cYou could say that.\u201d Even her voice was grumpy. Still, she couldn\u2019t very well tell him it was because she bore a grudge from a previous life. After the first time her life rewound to that pivotal moment, she\u2019d resolved to keep her loops a secret. \u201cI had plans for my exile. A brand-new life. And now because of you, my parents are involved. Even the king has heard about it!\u201d\nAfter Rishe rejected Arnold, Dietrich had immediately cried out, \u201cTh-the crown prince of Galkhein proposed to Rishe?!\u201d\nHis shrieks were loud enough to attract the attention of the master and mistress of the manor.\nWhen her parents came out, Rishe had protested, \u201cI\u2019m not going to marry him! I\u2019m leaving the country just as Dietrich commanded.\u201d\nNo one listened. Their faces just paled with nervous confusion.\nJust then, a glittering coach arrived. Half-stuck in the mud, the man inside it was forced to trudge over the swampy ground, and so the king of Hermity himself arrived, staggering and dirt-stained. \nHe grabbed hold of his son\u2019s collar, pushing him into a low bow. He then turned to Prince Arnold and said, rather loudly, \u201cYour Highness! Allow me to apologize for my son\u2019s foolishness! You are an esteemed guest all the way from Galkhein! It is unthinkable he would not offer you the courtesy you are due!\u201d\n\u201cYou\u2019re hurting me, Father! My back!\u201d\nThe king then turned to Rishe. \u201cMy lady, allow me to sincerely apologize as both a king and a father. My son\u2019s behavior toward you has been utterly disgraceful. I beg you to please give Prince Arnold\u2019s proposal due consideration. Not only for your own sake but for the sake of your country.\u201d\nThe king bowed to her as deeply as his son had to Arnold, and her parents joined him. Rishe felt dizzy at the sight of this abject debasement in the presence of citizens.\nArnold, who had been watching the proceedings with a detached amusement, sobered and stepped toward the king. \u201cYour Majesty, please rise.\u201d\nWithout the smirk, Arnold\u2019s face immediately reverted to its cold mask. The king didn\u2019t move. Maybe something in Arnold\u2019s voice kept him frozen.\n\u201cSuch a trifle won\u2019t cause discord between our kingdoms,\u201d he went on. \u201cHowever, I would beg a little time to speak with Lady Rishe.\u201d\nLater, Rishe would learn that Arnold\u2019s attendant had spoken to the king\u2019s own gentleman, certain that his words would reach their target. \u201cMy master took such trouble to attend these festivities, and this is the welcome he is offered? I wonder, what will the emperor think when he learns of his son\u2019s slighting at your nation\u2019s hands?\u201d\n\u201cIf you would, Lady Rishe?\u201d The plump king looked to be on the verge of tears.\nRishe had no obligation to accept and no desire to spend a moment longer in this country than was absolutely necessary. But acquiescence seemed the fastest way to move things along.\nAs her mind whirled, Arnold leaned in to whisper, \u201cIf you refuse to hear my suit, you won\u2019t deter me. I\u2019ll simply move on to Plan B.\u201d\nAnd that was how she found herself in one of the palace",
    "query_text": "\u2019s parlors, here to \u201cjust talk\u201d to Prince Arnold. The ball guests were all gone. It was just the two of them.\n\u201cI want to know what you\u2019re planning,\u201d Rishe said flatly.\n\u201cPlanning? Me?\u201d\n\u201cBy asking me to marry you. You don\u2019t know me. A proposal"

Engraved on the hilt was the Galkhein crest.\n\u201cOh!\u201d Rishe thrust the sword back at Arnold. \u201cMy apologies.\u201d\nArnold chuckled. \u201cYou caught me off guard. You were nodding off, and then you suddenly snatched up my sword. You looked quite content snuggling up with it.\u201d\nArnold propped the sword beside him. Rishe pressed a hand to her chest to quell her racing heart. The sword that gutted me in my previous life is now my bedmate. What a world. Her recent stint as a knight had left her ill at ease without a blade at hand. She just couldn\u2019t believe it was Arnold\u2019s she\u2019d reached for.\n\u201cI didn\u2019t mean to disturb you, but I doubted sleeping with a weapon would be comfortable. I\u2019m impressed you sensed my intent before I even touched you.\u201d Arnold rested one elbow against the window frame, watching her with shameless fascination. \u201cOne only develops instincts like that from combat training. And you were also a member of the court? How in the world did you find the time?\u201d\nRishe shrugged. She couldn\u2019t just say, I pretended to be a man in a previous life, that\u2019s how.\n\u201cI assume there\u2019s more to you than your devotion to the sword. You seem to like flowers.\u201d\nShe followed Arnold\u2019s gaze to where she\u2019d bundled a small bouquet in a handkerchief. This was their fifth day on the road to Galkhein. Every day, without fail, she\u2019d picked flowers whenever they stopped to water the horses. The ones from today were still fresh, but the ones she\u2019d begun drying five days ago were just about ready.\n\u201cI didn\u2019t pick these because they\u2019re pretty.\u201d Rishe brought the blooms to her face, spirits rising at their sweet scent. Spring wildflowers had a soft and gentle smell. Rishe looked out the window at the forest spreading toward Galkhein, thinking of the rare native flowers going into bloom. She wished she could pick those as well, but that would cause too much delay. She gazed on wistfully.\nAfter watching her in silence for some time, Arnold said, \u201cBy the way, I sent one of my men ahead on a fast horse to deliver your order to the company you requested. They\u2019ll be invited to Galkhein to discuss the wedding ceremony.\u201d\n\u201cThank you,\u201d Rishe said. \u201cI\u2019m glad you kept your word.\u201d\n\u201cThe Aria Trading Company,\u201d Arnold mused. \u201cI\u2019ve heard of them. They\u2019re up-and-comers, aren\u2019t they? Have you done business with them before?\u201d\n\u201cNo, but I heard from a friend that they hold a very high standard of quality.\u201d\nRishe was pleasantly surprised at how easily Arnold had acceded to her request. Typically, a royal household had their own personal dealer. Getting them to do business with someone else could be difficult.\nI want to establish a connection with Aria as soon as possible, Rishe thought. It was, of course, the company that had taken her in during her first life.\nThe company had been established just two years prior to picking her up by its owner, a man named Tully. They were still in their growth stage, but in just a few years, they would be the grandest trading company in all the world. They\u2019d proven a great boon in her life as an apothecary as well, helping to distribute her newest medicines. She\u2019d struggled to win their trust initially, but she pledged to work much harder this time around.\nThis marriage isn\u2019t going to happen\u2014I need an escape plan for when it all falls apart. I must bring to bear all my knowledge and influence as a crown princess.\nRishe didn\u2019t know Arnold\u2019s plans, but she had no intention of sitting around and waiting for him to use her as he pleased. She\u2019d spend her time as his consort wisely. Everything must serve her ultimate goal: to live longer than five years, and live well.\nHer fierce determination must have shown on her face because Arnold gave her a little bemused smile. \u201cYes?\u201d\nGod! Rishe grimaced at that flawlessly handsome countenance. Such beauty, possessed by such powerful destruction. The fact that he\u2019d been the man to kill her did nothing to lessen her fascination. In fact, it almost made it worse. The study of contrasts.\n\u201cSorry, I just\u2014\u201d\nShe was interrupted by the horses\u2019 loud whinnies.\n\u201cStop! Hey, stop the coach!\u201d\nShouts drifted back from conveyance ahead of theirs, which contained the luggage and attendants. The squadron of knights tailing the column of coaches sped off toward the front.\n\u201cWho do you think you\u2014graaargh!\u201d\nThat didn\u2019t sound good. Rishe moved to climb out, but Arnold was faster. He drew his sword.\n\u201cHey!\u201d\nArnold locked the door from the outside. \u201cStay hidden.\u201d\nWhy is he putting himself in danger? That\u2019s what knights are for! The fact that Rishe had been about to do the same thing didn\u2019t occur to her. It\u2019s probably bandits. He told me to stay hidden in here, but I\u2019m not so sure about that.\nArnold had left her locked in from the outside, hoping to keep her safe, but Rishe didn\u2019t like her odds. There were five coaches, but this one was certainly the grandest. It locked on the inside as well, but that wouldn\u2019t stop someone with enough determination. If she did as she was told, she\u2019d just be waiting patiently for a bandit to break a window and drag her out.\nKeeping one eye on the coachmen fleeing into the forest, Rishe began a methodical search for something to help her. Right\u2014her hairpin!\nThis sure brings me back. She unfastened it, twisting it into the gap in the door. Back when I was a maid, my lady would lock herself in her chambers all the time to avoid her studies. I had to break her out just like this.\nThe lock on the coach was simple, and it came open easily. Once she was free, she scanned her surroundings. She didn\u2019t see anyone who looked immediately hostile, but there was noise up ahead. Cautiously, she headed toward it.\nBefore long, she found Arnold.\nWow.\nRoughly ten men\u2014the bandits, she presumed\u2014lay crumpled on the ground. In their midst stood Arnold, in the process of tripping another man into the dirt. He scowled, blade at the man\u2019s throat. \u201cIs that it, then?\u201d\n\u201cGwugh!\u201d\nArnold kicked the bandit in the stomach, eyes blazing with cruelty. \u201cThat\u2019s all the thrill you offer me after I went to the trouble of drawing my sword? Barely worth it. I\u2019m bored already.\u201d\nHe wasn\u2019t angry; on the contrary, he stared his enemies down with chilly disappointment, as if this had all been a letdown. Even Arnold\u2019s own knights seemed terrified of their master when he was in a mood. Arnold smoothly flicked the blood off his sword, wiping the blade on the bandit\u2019s shirt before sheathing it. The rest of the men on the ground seemed to be unconscious.\nWait, he didn\u2019t kill anyone? Why not? Is it because we haven\u2019t reached Galkhein?\nShe supposed even Arnold knew better than to go around killing the citizens of other countries. Or perhaps he had yet to become the ruthless monster she knew him as.\nArnold seemed to sense her gaze, turning around with a start. Genuine emotion bloomed on his face, worlds away from the blank mask he wore to face down the bandits. \u201cHow did you get out of the coach?\u201d\nRishe shrugged. \u201cIf I tell you, you\u2019ll be able to prevent me from doing it again.\u201d\nArnold snickered. \u201cYou continue to amaze me.\u201d\nHow can you go from ice-cold to suddenly looking like a normal nineteen-year-old? It\u2019s disconcerting. \nRishe fought down her disquiet as a man alighted from a coach and shouted, \u201cYour Highness! Not again!\u201d He was Oliver, one of the prince\u2019s attendants. He had silver hair and was roughly as tall as Arnold.\n\u201cWhat do you think all these knights are for, decoration? Why do you insist on",
    "query_text": " endangering yourself?\u201d\nRishe had only met Oliver briefly a few days ago, but he didn\u2019t appear to be intimidated by Arnold at all. And, well\u2026he\u2019s not wrong.\nShe feared the menace would return to Arnold\u2019s expression, but he just looked annoyed."

    "prefix_text": " arrived in the imperial capital of Galkhein.\n\u201cOh my,\u201d Rishe murmured as they passed through the gates.\nWhite stone buildings stood in straight rows, lining clean, orderly streets. The first stories all appeared to be shops, while the second-floor windows were festooned with flowers. Everywhere she looked were smiling faces, citizens turned out to witness their prince\u2019s return over the smooth brick roads. Overlooking it all was the towering magnificence of the imperial palace.\n\u201cThe capital is the seat of power in Galkhein,\u201d Arnold explained. \u201cSeveral key trade routes converge here.\u201d\nRishe nodded, suddenly anxious to be out of the coach. More and more people were gathering to watch their progress, some carrying shopping bags in both arms or holding hands with children. Many of them waved, as if greeting someone dear to them.\nHappy citizens and clean, orderly streets meant wealth. Galkhein was well-off. Rishe couldn\u2019t help but grin at an adorable little girl watching them roll by with sparkling eyes. When she saw Rishe\u2019s smile, she blushed and leapt up in the air, laughing with delight.\nThe coach made its way through the city before passing through the castle gates. Lines of disciplined knights flanked the road, ready to greet the crown prince and his fianc\u00e9e.\nArnold stepped out of the coach, holding out his hand to Rishe. She took it reflexively as she alighted. A prince would be expected to help any lady out of carriage, never mind his own consort, yet for some reason the knights looked a bit disturbed.\nRishe shot them back of look of innocent confusion.\n\u201cOur long journey is at last at its end, Your Highness, Lady Rishe.\u201d Oliver emerged from the ranks of the knights, bowing. He shot Arnold a curious glance. \u201cHow novel to see you taking the hand of your fianc\u00e9e.\u201d\nAh! Rishe realized that she herself had willingly broken the condition that she had imposed. Arnold had offered his hand, but she was the one who accepted.\nArnold gave a little laugh of triumph. Rishe felt a rush of frustration at being tricked. \nOliver stared at them before leaning in to whisper in Arnold\u2019s ear. Arnold let out a breath of annoyance. \n\u201cIs something the matter?\u201d Rishe asked.\n\u201cI sent orders ahead to have a detached wing of the palace prepared for us, but it seems the preparations are behind schedule. I\u2019m sorry, but you\u2019ll need to stay in a guest room in the main palace for a few days.\u201d\n\u201cOh, I don\u2019t mind if the wing isn\u2019t ready,\u201d Rishe said. \u201cWe can head over there now.\u201d\n\u201cIt hasn\u2019t been used in quite a while. It\u2019ll be covered in dust.\u201d\n\u201cI said that I didn\u2019t mind if it was a mess, remember? But there\u2019s no need for you to put yourself out. By all means, stay in the main palace for as long as you need.\u201d Rishe had spent a life as a maid\u2014dust didn\u2019t scare her. \u201cBesides, I\u2019m a hostage, after all.\u201d\n\u201cYou could at least attempt to sound distressed,\u201d Arnold said with the slightest trace of petulance. \nRishe, who had a huge grin spreading over her face and her chest puffed out with pride, didn\u2019t respond.\n \n***\n \nThe detached wing turned out to be just a separate palace in the distant corner of the grounds\u2014a scant four stories tall and, as advertised, absolutely swimming in dust.\nNot so bad, though. Rishe had pictured decay and clutter, but it was mostly just bare. Bare and musty, but not rotten or falling apart.\n\u201cYou can do whatever you want with this place. I\u2019ll be occupied over the next few days, but feel free to use the guest apartments in the main palace if you get tired of choking to death,\u201d Arnold said before he left.\nAccording to Oliver, work had piled up while the prince was away, and it wasn\u2019t just a few things that could be dispensed with over a few days working around the clock.\nEmperor Arnold Hein\u2026 He\u2019s just a crown prince right now, but I still wish I knew what\u2019s going on in his head. For now, I\u2019ll just focus on what I can do. Like make this place livable.\nShe changed into her plainest dress and rolled up her sleeves. The knights who\u2019d remained to serve as her guard kept watch over her as she went from window to window, throwing them all open.\nIn a stroke of luck, the weather was good, and the detached wing was well placed to soak up the sun. The lack of any creature comforts made it look ascetic and drab, but once it was furnished, Rishe had no doubt it would be lovely.\nLeaving the top floors to air out, Rishe found the stairs to the basement. She pushed the heavy wooden doors open, and mice skittered over her feet. The knights yelped as Rishe descended into the darkness.\n\u201cL-Lady Rishe, why are you going down here?\u201d\n\u201cCleaning supplies are usually kept in the basement. See?\u201d\nThe knights followed her gaze to a duster, broom, dustpan, and pile of fresh cloths. She filled a bucket with water and went to work, rolling up a handkerchief to cover her mouth as she swept dust down from high on the walls. Then she swept up all the dust on the floor.\nIt\u2019s always satisfying to tackle a place this filthy.\nShe corralled the dust bunnies until they were piled up like snow in the center of the hall, and then she swept them out the open door. Once the floors were free of debris, she attacked them with the cloth.\n\u201cLady Rishe, is there anything we can do to help?\nRishe was grateful for the knight\u2019s offer, but she shook her head. \u201cYour job is to guard me, not do my housekeeping.\u201d\n\u201cThis is quite the place to clean on your own, detached though it may be,\u201d the knight said hesitantly. \u201cIt\u2019s not too late to move into the guest chambers instead.\u201d\n\u201cThat\u2019s all right. I like the place already.\u201d\nRishe remained steadfast in her refusal for one reason: readying guest chambers was an awful chore. The palace maids would be expected to work overnight to prepare them, even if the guests were only staying a single night. No speck of dust or strand of hair could remain. Certainly no wrinkled sheets. Rishe knew how exhausting and rigorous a maid\u2019s job was, how nerve-racking.\nShe refused to put the poor dears through such an ordeal for just a few days\u2019 stay. From the sound of things, the palace wasn\u2019t equipped with many housemaids. No doubt they already had their hands full.\n\u201cBesides, take a look.\u201d",
    "query_text": " She held out her arms wide, gesturing to her sparkling clean floor. The knights stared at the bright room in admiration. \u201cCleaning a place with your own hands makes living there that much more satisfying, you see.\u201d\nThe knights smiled their awkward but good-natured agreement.\nRishe worked tirelessly, and before long, the chambers"

    "prefix_text": " in the morning. She was pretty sure she had gone to bed around midnight last night.\nI slept for six whole hours? Rishe couldn\u2019t believe it. Generally, she was used to getting about four hours of sleep. On bad days, at the height of an emergency as a knight or apothecary, she wouldn\u2019t even get that much. \nI\u2019ve got nothing but cleaning on the schedule today. Hostages can sleep in, right? At least a little? Excitement suffused her at the thought, but that was interrupted by a knock on the door.\n\u201cLady Rishe, are you awake? It\u2019s Oliver\u2014Prince Arnold\u2019s attendant.\u201d\nRishe sat up with a start. \u201cI\u2019m awake!\u201d\nOliver continued to speak through the door. \u201cI apologize for bothering you at such an early hour. I\u2019m here with a delivery.\u201d\n\u201cJust a moment!\u201d Rishe slipped out of the bed, dressed quickly, and tugged the bed\u2019s canopy closed. She opened the door to find Oliver standing in the hallway with a polite smile.\nHe apologized again. \u201cThis was the only time I could slip away from His Highness\u2019s office. I\u2019m glad to see that you\u2019re already dressed.\u201d\n\u201cNot at all.\u201d Rishe paused, stepping back to allow him inside. \u201cOh my. You look exhausted.\u201d\nOliver grimaced. \u201cIs it that obvious? We\u2019ve been climbing through mountains of paperwork, but never mind me. His Highness has been working around the clock.\u201d\nRishe thought back to yesterday, how he had come all the way out to the balcony. He should have used that spare time to sleep. \u201cHe\u2019s in high demand, isn\u2019t he? He was even working on the trip over.\u201d\n\u201cHe finished all the work he brought along with us,\u201d Oliver confirmed. \u201cNow he\u2019s dealing with everything that piled up during his visit to Hermity.\u201d\n\u201cOh.\u201d Rishe grimaced in sympathy. He may have killed her in a past life, but she wouldn\u2019t wish the bureaucracy of kingship on anyone. \u201cIt\u2019s a shame he had to put his work on hold to attend a silly engagement party.\u201d\n\u201cNo matter. That party was how a committed bachelor finally found a bride.\u201d\nHis smile was sincere, but Rishe knew better. She spread her arms. \u201cGo on. Shall I spin around so you have a better view?\u201d\nOliver blinked. \u201cI beg your pardon?\u201d\n\u201cYou\u2019re looking me over like I\u2019m a horse for sale. If there\u2019s anything I can help you with, please let me know.\u201d\nOliver\u2019s brows went up. He let out a little breath of resignation. \u201cHis Highness was right. You do possess the keen perception of a knight. Of course, I\u2019m purely an amateur myself.\u201d\nI\u2019d say this was a merchant\u2019s sixth sense, rather than battle intuition.\nThis wasn\u2019t the first time Rishe had caught Oliver looking at her. It reminded her of the way her noble customers would examine a product, assessing worth and authenticity. Or a merchant weeding out potential merchandise from a wide array of choices.\nIn other words, he was appraising her.\nOliver moved into a deep, sweeping bow. \u201cMy sincerest apologies, my lady. I have been unaccountably rude to my lord\u2019s consort. My behavior was unacceptable.\u201d\nRishe shook her head. \u201cPlease don\u2019t, it\u2019s fine.\u201d It wasn\u2019t unreasonable for the prince\u2019s closest attendant to be wary of strangers. But it did make her curious. \u201cHow long have you worked for Arnold? Have you always been a valet?\u201d\n\u201cI trained as a squire, actually,\u201d Oliver replied. \u201cBut I was injured and dismissed from the order. His Highness took me into his household soon after. I have served him for nearly a decade.\u201d\n\u201cThen maybe you can answer this,\u201d Rishe said. \u201cWhy is Prince Arnold so very intent on making me his wife?\u201d\nOliver hesitated, as if weighing the pros and cons of speaking, \u201cTo be quite honest, I was as surprised as you were. He\u2019s always insisted he had no interest in marriage. But the sight of you in Hermity has changed his mind. Apparently.\u201d\nSo not even his attendant understood his motives. Rishe remained at a complete loss.\n\u201cIf I may, however?\u201d Oliver mistook Rishe\u2019s confusion for anxiety and added, \u201cI have served Prince Arnold for a long time, and never before have I seen him so happy. When he is with you, he laughs. His smiles are sincere.\u201d\nRishe was taken aback. She\u2019d figured all of Arnold\u2019s laughter and teasing was at her expense. His own private jokes.\n\u201cAre you\u2026unhappy with him?\u201d Oliver ventured. \u201cWith his looks, His Highness is exceedingly popular with the ladies of the court, you know.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m sure he has many admirers.\u201d She paused. \u201cWould you really call the way he acts around me \u2018happy\u2019? To me, it seems more like a cat with a mouse.\u201d\nOliver laughed. He didn\u2019t deny it. \u201cI am pleased you understand His Highness so well. Oh, I nearly forgot. Here.\u201d\nHe held out a sheaf of three documents. \u201cThis is the guest list for your wedding. His Highness bids you look over it.\u201d\n\u201cThank you,\u201d Rishe said, pleasantly surprised. She hadn\u2019t even needed to ask. She gave it a quick glance, quickly identifying the most prominent and powerful names.\nKing Zahad, Prince Kyle, Princess Harriet. And from the Kingdom of Domana, we have Lord Jonal attending as the representative of the king. No surprise there.\nMore than a wedding guest register, this was a list of key people from the countries Arnold would go on to antagonize. Even before the murder of the king and the start of the war, there must have been a trigger\u2014a sea change in the affairs of state. Everyone on this list was most likely involved.\nKing Zahad. I hope we can be friends again like in my first life. Hmm\u2026 Prince Kyle is rather frail. I hope he isn\u2019t working himself too hard. He has a strong sense of responsibility\u2014he\u2019ll attend the wedding even though it\u2019ll be a long trip.\nThe sight of these names filled Rishe with a longing for those lives, for the people she\u2019d once known. And sometime in the very near future, they would all be Galkhein\u2019s enemies.\nIf I take matters into my own hands, perhaps I can salvage some of these relationships before they sour. Even if we aren\u2019t allies, we don\u2019t have to be enemies. Anything to stave off the outbreak of war.\nOliver had no idea what was going through Rishe\u2019s head. Brightly, he continued their conversation. \u201cThe ceremony will be held in three months\u2019 time. All preparations must be complete by then. And now\u2026we need to discuss tonight\u2019s party.\u201d\n\u201cTonight\u2019s what?\u201d\nOliver stiffened. \u201cDid His Highness not tell you?\u201d\n\u201cNo, he most certainly did not! There\u2019s to be a party?\u201d\n\u201cUgh, not again!\u201d Oliver dug his knuckles into his forehead.\nRishe put two and two together. She hesitated, then said, \u201cSo there is one, then. As you must know, His Highness is trying to stamp it down without telling me.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d Oliver replied. \u201cHe should have mentioned it to you. You don\u2019t need to attend, but he will. At least, I hope he will. I think I managed to convince him.\u201d\nShe sympathized with Oliver. Under normal circumstances, it would be unheard of for the crown prince and his fianc\u00e9e to fail to appear at a banquet. \u201cDon\u2019t worry, Oliver. I\u2019ll go.\u201d\nOliver let out a sigh of relief. \u201cReally? Thank you so much, my lady. I\u2019ll put finding you a maid at the top of my to-do list.\u201d\n\u201cNo need.\u201d Rishe smiled. \u201cI can prepare for the party on my own.\u201d\nThis maid-selection process made Rishe uneasy. After witnessing that exchange between the servants in the garden, she imagined quarrels breaking out all through the palace. And she doubted the disputes would go away even after they decided.\nOliver frowned. \u201cBut won\u2019t dressing be difficult without a lady\u2019s maid?\u201d \nShe shook her head. \u201cI can do my hair and put on a gown by myself. I brought dresses and cosmetics from home. Don\u2019t worry.\u201d\nRishe ignored Oliver\u2019s stunned look, already reevaluating her cleaning plans.\n \n***\n \nThe first thing Rishe said to Arnold that night was, \u201cYour Highness, I have a request.\u201d Her gown rustled as she leaned in close. \u201cI would like some herb seed and a corner of the gardens. I made a list. I hope we can discuss this in more detail later.\u201d\nArnold was silent a moment. \u201cRishe.\u201d\n\u201cWhat? Didn\u2019t you tell me to let you know if there was anything I wanted?\u201d She looked at him quizzically, and Arnold sighed.\nShe\u2019d heard that he\u2019d finished his mountain of work and even managed to sleep for a while. He was dressed in his usual military black, trimmed with a red mantle and black gloves.\nArnold shook his head. \u201cThat\u2019s not what I mean. I\u2019m guessing that Oliver didn\u2019t tell you the reason for this party? It\u2019s merely for appearance\u2019s sake. I need to look like I\u2019m searching for a bride within our borders as well. There\u2019s no reason for you to attend.\u201d\nIt made sense. The crown prince\u2014the greatest catch in the kingdom\u2014marrying a foreigner without even the slightest nod to propriety would invite unwanted discontent from the nobility.\n\u201cHowever, we\u2019re betrothed,\u201d Arnold said. \u201cThis whole evening is merely a formality. And with news that you\u2019re my \u2018hostage\u2019 going around, you\u2019ll be an object of curiosity. I don\u2019t want to put you through that.\u201d\n\u201cWell, I already went to the trouble of getting ready.\u201d Rishe plucked at her soft blue dress, draped in fluttering layers around her like a flower bud. She\u2019d braided her hair, decorating it with accessories. Her makeup was light, her shoes polished to a mirror shine. Her only jewelry was a pair of pearl earrings.\n\u201cRishe\u2026\u201d\n\u201cYour Highness, the court may consider my status as a captive princess shameful in the extreme, but I don\u2019t.\u201d She\u2019d chosen this course, after all.\nArnold was again watching her with a mixture of wonder and confusion.\n\u201cSo don\u2019t worry,\u201d she said, extending her hand. \u201cFeel free to show off your fianc\u00e9e.\u201d\nArnold relented, his dashing smile creeping out once again. \u201cVery well. I should take advantage of this opportunity to touch my betrothed.\u201d\n\u201cWe\u2019re wearing gloves.\u201d\nArnold took Rishe\u2019s hand.\nA throng of guests was gathered in the ballroom as a group of musicians performed on a platform. Women in gowns stood clustered, while gentlemen in military attire grouped together. A mere glance was enough to tell their clothes were of the highest quality. They mingled happily, making small talk with glasses in hand.\nRishe let her hand rest on Arnold\u2019s arm as she paused at the threshold to take it all in. \u201cThis is a bigger event than I was expecting.\u201d\n\u201cIs it? I\u2019d say it\u2019s a rather small gathering, actually.\u201d\n\u201cMaybe for a military powerhouse,\u201d Rishe muttered. \nYet another reminder of Galkhein\u2019s wealth took her off guard. Arnold just looked bored.\n\u201cThe size doesn\u2019t matter,\u201d he said. \u201cIn the end, they\u2019re only here for gossip. Look, here they come.\u201d\nIn the blink of an eye, they were surrounded by guests.\n\u201cPrince Arnold, thank you for gracing us with an invitation,\u201d said one man. \u201cSuch a pleasure.\u201d \n\u201cThe pleasure is mine, Lord Abel,\u201d Arnold drawled.\n\u201cYour Highness! We were so glad to hear of your safe return,\u201d another guest chirped. \u201cPlease, our daughter is simply dying to be regaled with tales of your trip.\u201d\n\u201cI can\u2019t imagine I\u2019d have anything particularly exciting to share with her,\u201d Arnold said curtly.\nAfter the last few days, Rishe found this look of glazed apathy disturbing. His good looks only compounded it\u2014he was so handsome that every expression was stark.\nHe looks more like Emperor Arnold Hein now, but still not the same.\nArnold appeared to notice her watching him. When he looked at her, his sourness disappeared, replaced by a genuine smile. All around him, women found themselves flushing. Arnold paid no heed to their fervent gazes, instead leaning in to give Rishe a brief moment of consideration.\nThen he leaned in close enough to kiss her.\n\u201cA dull trip,\u201d he said again, pulling away. \u201cBut fortuitous. Without it, I would have never met the woman destined to be my wife.\u201d\nA shocked murmur rolled through the crowd. Rishe, who hadn\u2019t recovered from seeing Arnold\u2019s beautiful face at close range, barely noticed the looks of utter loathing the assembled women were throwing her.\n\u201cH-His Highness is smiling? At his hostage bride?\u201d\n\u201cHe called her his wife?! He\u2019s never even looked at us!\u201d\nThey were whispers, but they carried.\nA portly man stepped forward with his daughter in tow. \u201cYour Highness, do you mean to say that this lovely young woman is your fianc\u00e9e?\u201d\nEvery eye in the ballroom was on Rishe, alight with curiosity, envy",
    "query_text": ", or schemes. None of them could hide their contempt. But Rishe didn\u2019t falter.\nThis is nothing compared to being publicly dumped in a banquet hall. And I\u2019ve done that seven times!\nShe offered a polite smile and an astoundingly correct curtsy. Left leg at a diagonal behind the right, back straight, head bowed. \u201cHow do you do? My name is Rishe Irmgard Weitzner.\u201d\nEven the most hostile guests could find nothing impolite in her greeting, no sign of rough manners from the rustic daughter of a backwater nation. Rishe had years of training in expectation of ascending to the throne. Occasionally, habits from her other lives slipped through, but Arnold appeared to be the only one who noticed.\nNow he was looking at"

And he\u2019s a bit of a jerk, to be honest. \nShe tried to settle her mind and just observe. Gathering intelligence was necessary to lead a long, carefree life lazing around the palace.\nIf I recall correctly, that\u2019s Lord Hannawald. He seems to be on good terms with Count Gayle. Duke Hudemann and Duke Teinitz are having a friendly enough conversation, yet they don\u2019t seem close. Rishe ticked off the names of people she\u2019d met, committing them to memory.\nA wave of sweet perfume wafted over her. A pretty girl with soft blonde hair had appeared at her side. \u201cHow do you do, Lady Rishe? I\u2019m Cornelia Thea Toona.\u201d\nDuke Toona\u2019s family was the thirty-first house she\u2019d met tonight.\nRishe smiled graciously. \u201cRishe Irmgard Weitzner. A pleasure to meet you.\u201d\n\u201cThe pleasure is all mine.\u201d Cornelia smiled sweetly. Her eyes were big and bright, her lips full. She held a glass in each hand and offered one to Rishe. \u201cWine? I see you\u2019re empty-handed.\u201d\nA gaggle of other ladies nearby began giggling among themselves.\n\u201cHow dare she act so haughty when she\u2019s a captive. It\u2019s time for her learn just what she is. A pawn to be played and discarded.\u201d\n\u201cShe should enjoy her time on Prince Arnold\u2019s arm while she can.\u201d\n\u201cShe is from a minor nation, after all.\u201d\nAs Rishe took note of their whispers, Cornelia gazed at her with doe eyes. \u201cDoes my offering offend you in some way?\u201d\nIf I remember correctly, House Toona holds a vast territory in southern Galkhein.\nRishe held out a hand to accept the glass. \u201cHow could it? Thank you, Lady Cornelia.\u201d\nBefore Rishe could touch the glass, Cornelia gave a dramatic shout. \u201cOh dear! My hand slipped!\u201d She dropped it, quite obviously on purpose. Without thinking, Rishe grabbed her skirts and leaned back, plucking the glass out of the air with the other hand.\nCornelia let out a cry of surprise as Rishe caught the wine before any could spill. She swirled the glass and brought it to her nose to breathe in the bouquet.\nHmm\u2026 That\u2019s mashed capsicum. Where did she even get that? What a waste of perfectly good wine. And why bother spicing it enough to singe the tongue if she just planned to ruin my dress? Pick a plan, my dear.\nHiding her exasperation, Rishe smiled brightly. \u201cI\u2019ve never had a wine quite like this. What an unusual scent.\u201d\nCornelia bit her lip in frustration. Rishe beamed at her. You\u2019ve got such a pretty face, Lady Toona. Why don\u2019t you smile?\nRishe leaned in close to Cornelia. \u201cThis vintage isn\u2019t available where I\u2019m from. I\u2019m ever so anxious to learn more. Should I perhaps invite Prince Arnold over to enjoy a glass? Which tray did you get this from?\u201d\n\u201cWhat? Oh, um\u2026\u201d Rishe had a policy of never backing down from a fight, but it seemed Cornelia didn\u2019t share it. \u201cS-sorry, but I don\u2019t remember. Such a large hall, you see.\u201d\n\u201cA shame. I\u2019ll just give His Highness this one, then. I\u2019ll be sure to let him know who it\u2019s from.\u201d\n\u201cUh, wait!\u201d Cornelia rapidly shook her head. \u201cI-I got that glass for you, so I think you should\u2014you know what? Never mind! Maybe I should just take that\u2014oh no!\u201d\nRishe ignored the ashen-faced Cornelia, raising the glass and swallowing down a gulp. \n\u201cI-I can\u2019t believe\u2026\u201d\n\u201cSuch a spicy flavor, just as I imagined.\u201d Rishe smiled again to the assembled group\u2019s astonishment. \u201cWhat a warm welcome. I do hope the two of us can spend more time together. Perhaps\u2026a tea party?\u201d\n\u201cTh-the two of us?\u201d Cornelia stammered.\n\u201cYes. I want to know all about House Toona.\u201d\nCornelia looked flabbergasted, but she recovered herself and nodded.\nThat should do. One of Rishe\u2019s eventual plans required a plot of land in a temperate climate. House Toona\u2019s would likely be perfect, but she needed to confirm a few things with Cornelia. Never back down from a fight. Even further\u2026\nShe recalled the words of her mentor from her days as a merchant.\nDon\u2019t bother with fights you can\u2019t win.\nThe other ladies fled, fearful of this strange girl who gulped down painfully spicy wine like it was nothing. \n \n***\n \nRishe retreated to the empty balcony to enjoy the music, grimacing with every stinging mouthful of wine. She drank it in decreasing sips until Arnold joined her.\n\u201cWhat are you making that face for?\u201d\nRishe swirled the glass. \u201cDon\u2019t worry, it\u2019s not you. It\u2019s just this wine is so spicy.\u201d\n\u201cSpicy? The wine is?\u201d\n\u201cMm. It\u2019s seasoned with capsicum. I barely managed to get that first mouthful down without gagging.\u201d\nArnold swiped the glass from her hand. \u201cDon\u2019t tell me this was a poisoning attempt!\u201d\nRishe clicked her tongue in annoyance at her own lack of vigilance. No one else would be able to grab something from her so easily.\nArnold glared at the wine. \u201cYou don\u2019t need to drink this. I\u2019ll get rid of it.\u201d\n\u201cHey, give that back! They ruined a perfectly good glass of wine because of me. I\u2019m not going to waste it.\u201d She grabbed it back and took another sip, shuddering at the taste.\nArnold glowered. \u201cTell me who did this. I\u2019ll have them executed.\u201d\n\u201cDon\u2019t be ridiculous. You don\u2019t kill people like her\u2014you use them.\u201d Just the tiniest bit of wine to go, but it was getting harder to make herself drink it. She gave the glass a reproachful look, then glanced back at Arnold. \u201cOh, and I owe you an apology.\u201d\n\u201cDo you?\u201d\n\u201cI used your name to defend myself.\u201d The girls had only backed off when she threatened to tattle to Arnold. Rishe found that sort of thing inelegant in the extreme, and she was embarrassed.\nArnold sighed at Rishe\u2019s apologetic bow. \u201cThere\u2019s nothing wrong with a wife invoking her husband\u2019s name.\u201d\nRishe hesitated. \u201cWe\u2019re not married yet.\u201d\n\u201cThat\u2019s a formality. It\u2019s as good as done, if you ask me.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2026see.\u201d\nHe took her distraction as an opportunity to swipe her glass back. Instead of dumping it out, Arnold gulped the rest of it down. \n\u201cDamn, that packs a punch,\u201d he grumbled.\n\u201cI told you that!\u201d Rishe snapped. \u201cAre you all right? Let me get you some water!\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m fine. But now you\u2019ve fulfilled your obligation to the wine, haven\u2019t you?\u201d\nRishe didn\u2019t know what to say. He\u2019d helped her\u2014not by taking charge but by following her lead. Without cutting her down and telling her she was being foolish. Without rolling his eyes and dismissing her desires as trifles.\n\u201cThank you,\u201d Rishe said stiffly, which just made him laugh.\n\u201cWhat were you thinking about when we were dancing?\u201d he asked.\n\u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d\n\u201cYou were thinking about someone else, weren\u2019t you? Who?\u201d\nRishe didn\u2019t know a delicate way to say I was thinking about a future version of you I met in another life.\n\u201cHmm?\u201d His tone was oddly light, teasing even. But the gleam in his hunter\u2019s eyes said she wouldn\u2019t get away so easily.\nObviously, Rishe couldn\u2019t give him an honest answer. \u201cI wasn\u2019t thinking about anyone else. I was worried about you.\u201d\n\u201cWhy?\u201d\nThis was the closest she could come to the truth. \u201cWere you injured here?\u201d She patted her own left shoulder with her forefinger. \nArnold went silent. His left shoulder was slightly slower to react than his right\u2014if his right was at one hundred, then his left was at maybe ninety-eight. It was hardly noticeable, but Rishe had picked up on it. He was right-handed, and she wouldn\u2019t have noticed it if they\u2019d been dancing normally. \nThat, and if it hadn\u2019t been for memories from her past life.\nRishe had only managed to inflict a single injury on him. An instant, a moment\u2019s hesitation where she saw her chance and slashed left. Of course, he\u2019d shrugged off the injury and effortlessly run her through. \n\u201cHeh.\u201d Arnold finally broke his silence with grim laughter. His eyes sent shivers down her spine, cold and bewitching. In lieu of an answer, he reached for his collar, unfastening the clasp with a snap and drawing his jacket open with a rough tug.\nOh my.\nRishe drew in a breath. A great scar was engraved into the nape of his neck, just low enough to be concealed by clothing. It looked several years old. \u201cIt\u2019s an old wound. It continues to the top of my shoulder and pulls the skin taut.\u201d\n\u201cHow awful.\u201d Rishe couldn\u2019t help but reach out to gingerly touch the nape of his neck.\nArnold accepted her touch without a word. She\u2019d half expected to be slapped aside.\nHer fingers slowly traced the shape of it. She could feel the rough skin through her gloves.\nHe must have gotten this over a decade ago. Someone stabbed him\u2014and not just once or twice. They must have done it over and over to make this scar pattern.\nHer medical training had her shuddering at the image of a nine-year-old Arnold ashen and trembling with blood loss. The fact that he\u2019d survived and retained the use of his arm was incredible. And then to go on to wield a sword so skillfully\u2014his suffering must have been immense.\n\u201cOnly a few people know about this injury. You\u2019re the first to notice on your own.\u201d\n\u201cHow did it happen?\u201d\nThat grim smile returned as he looked down at Rishe. With the moon hanging behind him, he was as opaque as ever, but Rishe understood the sentiment.\nI shouldn\u2019t pry.\nRishe pulled her hand away, and that ominous smile that sent chills down her spine disappeared. Arnold put his jacket back in order, reclasping it at the neck.\nSomeone tried to kill Arnold Hein about ten years ago. But who and why? Rishe cast her eyes down as she ruminated. The most obvious beneficiaries of a dead crown prince would be potential heirs and those loyal to them. I believe Arnold has a younger brother, but I haven\u2019t met him yet.\nOdd. Rishe might be a hostage, but shouldn\u2019t she meet her future relatives? Perhaps it was Arnold\u2019s doing and not the will of the imperial family themselves. He didn\u2019t seem to want to involve her in anything unless it was absolutely necessary\u2014he hadn\u2019t told her about this ball, after all. \nRishe looked up at him. \u201cYour Highness, may I select my maids some time over the next few days?\u201d \n\u201cVery well. I\u2019ll tell Oliver to make that a priority.\u201d\n\u201cAh, I can do the selection myself. We needn\u2019t trouble him.\u201d\nArnold arched an amused brow. Gone was that unsettling smile, replaced with his easy manner. \u201cWhat are you planning this time?\u201d\n\u201cOh, nothing important,\u201d Rishe said. She picked up her empty glass. \u201cI\u2019m merely concerned about the servants\u2019 working conditions.\u201d\nTo protect her life and well-being, she needed to keep from dying at twenty years old again. And to do that, she had to prevent Arnold Hein\u2019s war. Her best bet would be to appeal to the important people she\u2019d known in her past lives. People with influence.\nPlus, there was a mountain of things she needed to do in preparation for the marriage ceremony.\nI need to sow a plot of land, grow herbs, do lots of shopping, get cheap alcohol, and then\u2026 \nRishe began a to-do list that had nothing to do with war in the least.\n \n***\n \nAs the ball wound to a close, a lone boy stood in the gloomy courtyard of the imperial palace. He had soft black hair and round blue eyes. No older than sixteen, he had an androgynous grace to him, gaze fixed on the balcony above. \nHe was watching a girl.\nShe had coral-colored hair, and even from this distance, he could tell she was beautiful. She stood there alone, apparently waiting for someone. Whoever it was must have shown up because her hand slipped from the banister, and she stepped away. Not too long after, a man appeared where she had been standing.\nThe man turned a silent glare down into the garden, as if he\u2019d known the boy had been there the whole time, despite the shadows.\nA shiver ran down the boy\u2019s spine and he smiled reflexively, delighting in the intense aura of threat the man gave off. It was just a warning, it seemed, as the man abruptly turned on his heel and disappeared. \n\u201cAww, we can\u2019t play together either?\u201d The boy hung his head. \u201cI miss you, Brother.\u201d\nIt had to be the woman. The beauty. She\u2019d made the boy\u2019s life hell since the day she arrived. \nHis brother had prohibited him from attending balls like this one. That was fine; he\u2019d sooner avoid them altogether. Still, he\u2019d wanted to meet that girl. \n\u201cBut we\u2019ll meet soon enough, won\u2019t we?\u201d He spoke to himself in a soft voice. \u201cI\u2019ve got plans for you, Sister.\u201d \n\n(2) chapter number given is likely out of range: 0\nChapter: 8\n\nChapter 3\nChapter 3\n \n\u201cYOU\u2019RE ALL SO USELESS!\u201d Diana the redheaded maid\u2019s voice rang out inside the stone washhouse. \nThree days had passed since the afternoon Rishe shook off her guard and came out to the well. Rishe was once again dressed to fit in with the maids. At Diana\u2019s shout, she looked up without pausing in her work. \n\u201cIs even laundry beyond your capabilities? I asked you to wash these this morning, and now it\u2019s past noon! Meanwhile, we\u2019ve finished cleaning the entire first floor in a third of the time!\u201d\n\u201cI-I\u2019m sorry, Diana.\u201d\nThe new maids went silent with shame. Among them was Elsie, the girl Rishe stood up for the other day. Rishe pulled her hands out of the soapy water, gently rinsed them, and said, \u201cLet me help. What still needs to be done?\u201d\n\u201cYou again?\u201d Diana rounded on Rishe. \u201cI don\u2019t know who you serve, but I\u2019m amazed you have the time to do other people\u2019s work. I wish I had so much free time.\u201d\nHuffily, she turned from Rishe. \u201cLet\u2019s just ignore these useless fools. Laura, Maya. Come on. If we want to be chosen as Lady Rishe\u2019s maids, we mustn\u2019t waste our time.\u201d\nDiana took out a slip of paper from her pocket, smoothing it out. \u201cIt looks like the new bedsheets for her palace will arrive today. We should inspect them to make sure everything is perfect!\u201d\n\u201cWait up, Diana!\u201d\nThe two maids followed Diana out. Rishe waited for the door to close before turning to Elsie and the others. \u201cLet\u2019s keep working. If there\u2019s anything too large and cumbersome, feel free to pass it over to me.\u201d\n\u201cTh-thank you so much!\u201d The new maids went weak with gratitude. One of them, a girl on the verge of tears, even fell into a full bow. Rishe muttered encouragement as she scrubbed some bedsheets.\nElsie, who was washing the sheets with her, wore a rueful look. \u201cI\u2019m so sorry for the trouble. We\u2019re just not learning fast enough.\u201d\n\u201cYou haven\u2019t been working here long, have you? It takes time to learn a new job, no matter who you are,\u201d Rishe said as she kept scrubbing. \u201cAnd it\u2019s not like you\u2019ve never washed a single thing in your life before, right?\u201d\nElsie nodded nervously. \nRishe had realized over the past few days doing the laundry that not all the newcomers were complete amateurs. They\u2019d obviously done chores at home, or something similar. When set a specific task, they could perform it properly, but Diana\u2019s complaints weren\u2019t unfounded. They did take far too much time with laundry.\nBut it\u2019s obvious why. \u201cDo you know anything about Diana?\u201d Rishe asked Elsie. \u201cLike, is she from a well-off family?\u201d\nElsie said, \u201cI heard that her father was a business owner. She worked with him.\u201d\n\u201cI heard that as well,\u201d added another maid. \u201cBut he fell into debt and had to sell off.\u201d \nRishe stopped scrubbing for a moment to consider this.\n\u201cUm, is something the matter?\u201d Elsie asked.\nRishe smiled and shook",
    "query_text": " her head. \u201cNo, nothing. Let\u2019s just focus on getting these washed for the time being.\u201d\n \n***\n \nThat afternoon, thirty maids were assembled in the detached wing of the palace. Ten of them were old hands, long in service to the royal family, while the other twenty were freshly hired. The crown princess was to choose her maids from among these thirty. They wore their nerves plainly on their sleeves. \n\u201cHey, I thought this palace was in a terrible state of neglect,\u201d one maid whispered. \u201cWhy is it so sparkling clean?\u201d\n\u201cYeah, you\u2019re right,\u201d said another. \u201cSomeone must have sorted it out before we arrived.\u201d\n\u201cI wonder what kind of person Lady Rishe is. Ooh, I\u2019m so nervous.\u201d\nThe girls looked around anxiously"

Please, I beg you, my lady!\u201d\n\u201cStep back,\u201d Oliver warned. \u201cDo not take a single step closer to Lady Rishe.\u201d\nDiana spoke in a rush, words pouring out of her. \u201cI-I freely admit that I was impolite before, but I didn\u2019t know who she was! I\u2019ll take any punishment, so please, give me the chance to show you how well I can work!\u201d\nRishe said, \u201cDiana, I have a request.\u201d\n\u201cTh-thank you, my lady!\u201d Diana heaved a sigh of relief. \u201cYou mean you\u2019ll\u2014\u201d \nRishe cut across her. \u201cAs of today, you are no longer a maid in this palace.\u201d \n\u201cWhat?\u201d Her face, usually so fixed with determination, paled. \u201cBut why? I\u2019m so much better than any of them! I\u2019ll do a perfect job no matter what task you set before me. Please don\u2019t dismiss me, my lady!\u201d \n\u201cListen to me, Diana.\u201d Rishe dropped her lofty tone, speaking as one woman would to another. \u201cYou have noticed it, haven\u2019t you? No matter what you claim, these new girls aren\u2019t worthless.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2026I don\u2019t understand.\u201d\n\u201cCan you remember your first month in service? How difficult it was?\u201d\nDiana looked completely bewildered. Her gaze darted around as if looking for help.\nPulling herself together, she forced herself to follow Rishe\u2019s directions. She thought back and finally alighted on a response. \u201cI\u2026I didn\u2019t know how to do the job. Before, when my family was still prominent, I\u2019d washed shirts and bedsheets. Never gowns or military uniforms.\u201d\n\u201cPerfectly reasonable,\u201d Rishe said. \u201cOnly natural for someone just starting out.\u201d\n\u201cThe older girls were so busy, they told me to just watch them since they didn\u2019t have time to teach me. When I had questions\u2026well, there was nobody to ask.\u201d\n\u201cI bet. And did you have any other problems?\u201d\n\u201cWell, yes. There was a lot to learn. Different kinds of soap and washboards depending on the cloth. You use different tools for different materials. I had to learn how they worked and how to put them away. I was\u2026punished if I didn\u2019t get it right the first time.\u201d\nThe newcomers were exchanging surprised looks. Rishe understood why.\nEverything Diana said was familiar to them. They spent valuable time searching for their materials and the proper ways to use them, but they shrank from asking for help. Everyone always looked so busy. This was a universal problem.\n\u201cDespite all that, I got better!\u201d Diana protested. \u201cI only needed to be taught once. Unlike them! They\u2019re useless!\u201d\n\u201cYes, well. There\u2019s a difference between you and them,\u201d Rishe told Diana. \u201cYou can read and write.\u201d\n\u201cOh!\u201d Diana started in surprise. Elsie looked at the floor.\nThe literacy rate among commoners was low no matter where you went. Very few families had the means to afford an education, especially for daughters. Diana had been born to a merchant\u2019s family\u2014she\u2019d received formal schooling. The maids she was close friends with were likely from similar backgrounds. The majority of those in service were not so fortunate.\n\u201cWhat if you only received instructions on how to do a job once and weren\u2019t able to write it down to remind yourself later?\u201d Rishe asked. \u201cWould you be so confident?\u201d\n\u201cI-I don\u2019t\u2014\u201d Diana reflexively thrust a hand into her apron pocket, where she had a list of daily tasks recorded in her neat handwriting to reference throughout the day. Hopefully now she would understand how much of an edge her privileged literacy gave her over the other maids.\n\u201cEveryone else works as hard as they can, just like you do,\u201d Rishe said. \u201cRemember how it was for you at first? They all have to start somewhere. I hope you\u2019ll keep that in mind.\u201d\n\u201cThey\u2019re no different from me,\u201d Diana mumbled begrudgingly, glancing around the room, looking at the less experienced maids. As if coming to a decision, she said, \u201cI\u2019m sorry.\u201d\n\u201cDiana?\u201d\nLike a child enumerating her regrets, Diana went on, \u201cI\u2019ve done you wrong, all of you. It\u2019s just, I had nothing. Or so it felt like. No money, no title. I thought I had to make my way in the world on my own. That I had to start from zero.\u201d Her shoulders trembled as she buried her face in her hands. \u201cBut I was wrong! I wasn\u2019t starting from zero. I had everything that I learned growing up. I didn\u2019t realize how fortunate I was. I let it all go to my he\n \n\u201cRISHE IRMGARD WEITZNER! You are a vile woman! A truly malicious creature unworthy of the crown prince! As of this instant, our engagement is off!\u201d \n\u201cAs you wish, Your Highness.\u201d\n\u201c\u2026Huh?\u201d\nThe prince\u2019s declaration echoed throughout the ballroom. Rishe, the duke\u2019s daughter, bowed in response, her coral-toned hair swaying gracefully. The assembled guests found themselves captivated by her dignified beauty. Despite having just witnessed a broken engagement, they couldn\u2019t bring themselves to pity her.\nSlowly, Rishe lifted her head and fixed the prince with a pale-emerald gaze. It caught him off guard, but he quickly recovered.\n\u201cDidn\u2019t you hear what I just said?! I\u2019m calling off our engagement! Doesn\u2019t that trouble you?\u201d\n\u201cNot really.\u201d\nRishe already knew what happened next: false accusations, exile, and her family severing all ties and leaving her to survive on her own. She turned from the prince. There was no point wasting any time.\nThis is my seventh loop, after all.\nRishe had done this all before.\nThe next few hours will be busy. I must hurry and retrieve my things before I\u2019m barred from the family estate. I don\u2019t want this to be one of the times I\u2019m too slow and I have to start my new life with nothing.\n\u201cRishe, halt and hear me! I have spent the past week perfecting my recitation of your crimes!\u201d\nI should take more than dresses this time\u2014there\u2019s plenty of things I could use out in the world. What trade should I take up? In my first life, I was a merchant. In my second, an apothecary. I\u2019ve got a few more I want to try out\u2026 Augh! If time\u2019s just going to keep resetting, I wish I could start at an earlier point. I need more time to prepare!\n\u201cWait! Rishe!\u201d\nThe crown prince was on the verge of tears, and the spectators struggled to suppress their snickers. \nA thought occurred to Rishe, and she stopped. She then turned, her eyes gleaming beneath long lashes as she stared down her ex-fianc\u00e9. \u201cAh, Your Highness, I almost forgot.\u201d \n\u201cYes, tell me!\u201d the prince fumed. \u201cLet me guess, you are hurt beyond measure and yet love me still\u2026correct?\u201d\nAs if. Rishe was grateful to be granted her freedom. In fact, she was smiling as she said, \u201cI hope you and Lady Mary are happy together.\u201d\n\u201cWhat?!\u201d\n\u201cMay we both lead fulfilling lives. Farewell!\u201d Rishe lifted the skirts of her evening gown and turned on her heel, departing as briskly as she could.\n\u201cHow do you know about Mary? I haven\u2019t told you I love her!\u201d The prince was shouting something behind her, but she paid him no mind. She had things to do.\nDuring her first loop, the prince\u2019s accusations had shocked her to the core and she\u2014foolishly so\u2014had attempted to defend herself. Now she knew better than to expect the prince to behave reasonably. \nHow will life unfold this time? I\u2019m excited to find out! Rishe fixed her mind on the future.\nThis is my seventh \u201cdo-over.\u201d I\u2019ve led happy and carefree lives before, but this time\u2014this time, I swear I\u2019ll live a long happy and carefree life!\nIn other words, she needed to avoid getting killed. At any cost. \n \n***\n \nIn the first loop, with her engagement broken and her reputation in tatters, Rishe roamed with nothing but the clothes on jewelry. Finding them a good-natured band, she hitched a ride to a neighboring country.\nFrom the merchant caravan, she learned a trade, studying how to procure stock and balance ledgers. Eventually, she set out on her own to travel the world. Her upbringing as a daughter of the nobility meant that, even at fifteen years old, Rishe possessed a keen sense for beauty.\nShe collected things that caught her eye and sold them to whoever found delight in her wares. Before she realized it, she had become a major vendor, employing a full staff. She had even done business with the king of a desert nation and the prince of a frozen country up north. She traveled to many distant places, realizing a dream born from her cossetted former life spent doing nothing but preparing to be queen.\nFive years passed, and just as she had only one country left to visit, Rishe fell victim to the war sweeping across the continent.\nThe next thing she knew, she was fifteen years old again and back at that party, with the prince poised to make his pronouncement.\n\u201cRishe Irmgard Weitzner! You are a vile woman! A truly malicious creature unworthy of the crown prince! As of this instant, our engagement is off!\u201d\nNaturally, she didn\u2019t understand what was going on at first. She looked around. Everything was the same. She stood in the same place wearing the same dress and draped in the same jewelry she\u2019d sold to the caravan.\nWas it a dream? Or was everything that had happened up until then the dream? In her confusion, all she could do was stare.\nRishe hurried out of the ballroom, the impending threat of exile hanging over her and the prince\u2019s entreaties to halt ringing in her ears.\nThis is perfect! Now I can get it right! I\u2019ll grab everything valuable from my room.\nRishe had enjoyed her life as a merchant, but she had always felt a stirring of regret about this night. If only she\u2019d brought some funds from home, she would\u2019ve had the capital to establish her business much sooner!\nSpeaking of this regret always prompted disbelief from her customers, including the king of the desert. \u201cWhat? That\u2019s what you\u2019d want to do over?!\u201d\nWhen she arrived back at home on the night of her second life, Rishe grabbed her jewelry box and as many of the books her late grandmother had left her as she could carry, then made haste to the forest to meet the caravan. But the stop at her house took time, and she missed them completely.\nIn that moment, Rishe made a stark realization. Different choices meant different mistakes. Opening one door would close another.\nAnd so the easy path to a life in commerce was closed to her.\nSure, she could try to build her business from the ground up, but personal connections were almost as essential to being a merchant as business savvy. It just wasn\u2019t realistic without a single acquaintance. \nSorting through her belongings in resignation, she came across a foreign encyclopedia of herbs among her grandmother\u2019s books. Taking it as a sign, Rishe sold her jewels elsewhere and used the funds to cross the sea and pursue the study of medicine.\nFortunately, Rishe retained all her knowledge from her previous life. She remembered that certain expensive herbs could be acquired cheaply in other regions. When word spread of a disease running rampant",
    "query_text": " in a neighboring country, she recalled that too. This foreknowledge proved invaluable, as did her wide travel and exposure to many different teachers with many different points of view.\nAs such, Rishe led a successful life as an apothecary. She saved a feeble prince, synthesized a number of rare medicines with her mercantile knowledge, and thus spent her days in the simple joy of helping those in need.\nUnfortunately, all the joy in the world couldn\u2019t stand up to an epidemic. Thus ended her second life. \nOnce again, she found herself in the moment of her broken engagement, the curtain rising on the third loop. Her next four lives proceeded much the same way. As a skilled lady\u2019s maid, she helped a young noblewoman to a fortuitous marriage. Once, she even disguised herself as a man and became a knight. Every life was worth living, and she enjoyed them all. She enjoyed living, period.\nThere was just one problem"

    "prefix_text": "aked in mud, your shoes are broken, and there are cuts marring your face and arms. What other possible cause could there be than heartbreak?\u201d\nRishe narrowed her eyes. \u201cDo you ever stop to think about the words coming out of your mouth?\u201d\n\u201cWhat?\u201d\nHis interpretation of events was fanciful to the point of absurdity. \u201cI did not dirty my dress or snap my shoes out of heartbreak. Because I feel none. You\u2019ve always been a little slow, so I\u2019ll make this clear: I do not have a single shred of fondness for you, or for our broken engagement.\u201d\n\u201cWhat?!\u201d the prince said. \u201cWhat are you saying?!\u201d\nThe surrounding crowd began to snicker.\n\u201cIsn\u2019t that the crown prince? Did Lady Rishe just dump him?\u201d\n\u201cWait, but wasn\u2019t he trying to dump her?\u201d\n\u201cCan\u2019t be! Look at her! She doesn\u2019t care at all!\u201d\n\u201cHow dare you nobodies make sport of me?\u201d Dietrich screeched. \u201cI am your prince!\u201d\nTemper aside, Dietrich was a handsome man. He had azure-blue eyes and blond hair\u2014a prince straight out of a picture book. His looks and place in the succession meant a never-ending swarm of women vying for his affections. He was brought up a pampered princeling, never wanting for anything. It manifested in a pompous manner and an overconfidence in his own abilities. Rishe had cautioned him about his attitude before, but he never paid her any mind.\nI\u2019m so glad I don\u2019t have to marry him.\nShe wished she could go back and tell the shocked, scared girl from her first life not to worry about her shattered engagement. Still, she might as well say it all here and now, with the assembled knights and citizens to bear witness.\n\u201cYour Highness, you exist to love and protect your people. It\u2019s unbecoming to speak of them in this manner.\u201d\n\u201cYou\u2019re the unbecoming one!\u201d the prince snapped. \u201cBeg me for forgiveness!\u201d\n\u201cI won\u2019t. Calling off our betrothal is the best course, and I applaud Your Highness for your good sense.\u201d\nNow even the knights were trembling with suppressed mirth. \nDietrich was turning red. \u201cD-don\u2019t laugh at me!\u201d\n\u201cLady Rishe,\u201d came a sweet voice. \u201cAren\u2019t you ashamed of yourself?\u201d \nRishe fought down a groan.\nOut of the crowd stepped a charming, dainty girl. Her big eyes moist with tears, she took her place at Dietrich\u2019s side. \u201cI do not allow the people I care about to be treated so very ill!\u201d \n\u201cWhy, Lady Mary. You\u2019re here.\u201d Rishe sighed. \u201cHow nice.\u201d\nThe young Mary scowled through her tears. Hidden behind her skirts, Dietrich continued to shout his disapproval. \u201cRishe! You\u2019ve brought my beloved Mary to tears! She\u2019s told me everything. How you bullied her, ridiculed her. How you find it amusing to lock her in the classroom overnight! Such a wicked woman could never be queen!\u201d\nNone of that\u2019s true.\nRishe glanced at Mary, who averted her gaze a little awkwardly.\n\u201cMore importantly,\u201d Rishe said, \u201chave you already brought your concerns to my parents, Your Highness?\u201d\n\u201cMore importantly?! I did, if you must know! Your parents are furious. They have vowed to disown you.\u201d\n\u201cAh. Then I\u2019m too late.\u201d Her parents held their reputation above all else. Rishe had little hope of retrieving any of her money or belongings now.\n\u201cWhy are you acting so strangely?\u201d Dietrich sniffed. \u201cAh, I understand. You\u2019re in such shock from this turn of events that\u2014\u201d\n\u201cListen, Dietrich.\u201d In her exasperation, Rishe dropped his title. \u201cI accept your decree. We are no longer engaged. I shall never darken your doorstep again. So\u2026relax a little.\u201d\n\u201cHuh? What are you saying?\u201d\n\u201cSince I was a child, I believed that my only value was in our betrothal. Being engaged to the crown prince was my whole reason for living. I was wrong about that. Only I determine my value\u2014no one else. That\u2019s why I don\u2019t care about this. I\u2019m beyond it.\u201d Rishe made sure to look him directly in the eye as she spoke. \u201cYou are an unnecessary element in my life.\u201d\nDietrich staggered back. His legs seemed to go out from under him, and he crumpled. At that, the knights finally let go of their composure, laughing along with the courtiers.\n\u201cSt-stop!\u201d the prince wailed. \u201cYou are my subjects. This\u2026this shows such flagrant disrespect!\u201d\n\u201cDietrich, don\u2019t pay them any mind,\u201d Lady Mary said. \u201cLady Rishe, is this cruelty necessary?\u201d\n\u201cPerhaps this is a blessing in disguise.\u201d Rishe\u2019s attention moved to Mary, making the girl\u2019s slender shoulders jump. She had no reason to worry; Rishe didn\u2019t bite. \u201cI\u2019ve been wanting the opportunity to speak to you, Lady Mary. You\u2019re strong. I admire you very much.\u201d\n\u201cWhat are you talking about?\u201d\n\u201cYou\u2019re a lovely girl who never fails to smile despite your troubles. You don\u2019t put up walls around your heart, and you do your utmost to put others at ease. Even now, you bravely stand before me to protect the prince.\u201d\nMary\u2019s eyes were wide with confusion. Rishe picked her words carefully, attempting to diminish the girl\u2019s guilty feelings, if only a little. \u201cYou need to marry the prince for your family\u2019s sake, right?\u201d\n\u201cHow do you\u2014?\u201d\nRishe had learned this truth in one of her past lives. Mary was born to a poor family, and she had studied like mad to be accepted into the academy to hunt for a husband. She intended to make sure neither she nor her brothers ever went hungry again.\nShe went on, \u201cRemember this: you are the one in control of your life. Don\u2019t sell it to anyone else. Can you trust a man who so easily discards the woman he\u2019s been engaged to since childhood? Do you truly believe he cares for you?\u201d\nAstonishment bloomed across Mary\u2019s face. She looked over at Dietrich, who hadn\u2019t bothered to stand up. The truth was\u2026within a year, Prince Dietrich would be in prison, his title stripped from him. He would plan a mad coup d\u2019\u00e9tat against the king, attempting to provoke the citizens to war. His plan would be discovered in its early stages, rendering him a laughingstock across the kingdom.\n\u201cYou must shape your future with your own hands\u2014you mustn\u2019t entrust your desires to others.\u201d \n\u201cMy\u2026my desires?\nRishe nodded.\nMary was looking at her like she was speaking a foreign language. \u201cBut I\u2019m their elder sister.\u201d Her voice quivered. \u201cI must endure, no matter what. Otherwise, my brothers will never be happy.\u201d\n\u201cAnd you believe their happiness can only be achieved by sacrificing your own?\u201d\nMary gasped as she gaped at Rishe.\n\u201cYou don\u2019t need to throw away your own future to protect those you love,\u201d Rishe told her. \u201cNo matter what path you choose, never forget that.\u201d\n\u201cMy future?\u201d Mary\u2019s voice went ragged, like she was barely suppressing a wail of pain.\n\u201cI wish you a life where both you and your family can be happy,\u201d said Rishe.\nMary stood frozen in place, eyes gleaming like precious stones. Rishe couldn\u2019t help but admire how pretty she was. She truly did wish her happiness. But right now, she needed to take care of herself. \n\u201cWell.\u201d Rishe suddenly broke into a smile, making Dietrich flinch. \u201cI think it\u2019s time for me to be on my way.\u201d\nShe regretted losing access to her room, but she knew her parents wouldn\u2019t let her in. Turning her back on the crowd, Rishe contemplated her next move.\n\u201cWait, Lady Rishe!\u201d Mary\u2019s voice rang out.\n\u201cThat\u2019s right. You\u2019re not going anywhere, Rishe!\u201d The prince joined her. \u201cYou won\u2019t get away with treating me like trash to relieve your own injured heart.\u201d\n\u201cUgh, enough already!\u201d Rishe\u2019s patience was fraying. \u201cI don\u2019t have anything else to say to you. Goodbye!\u201d\n\u201cKnights, stop her!\u201d\nReluctantly, the knights moved to tail Rishe as she walked briskly back down the path. She sympathized with them, but she wasn\u2019t about to let them keep her here. Rounding a corner, she sensed something uncanny. She stopped, the knights quickly catching up with her.\n\u201cMy apologies, Lady Rishe. If you could please remain for just a\u2014whoa!\u201d\nRishe grabbed the hilt of the knight\u2019s sword. Yanking it from his belt, she spun around and stood at the ready. Metal rang against metal as Rishe parried a blow. She glared at her would-be attacker as he stepped out of the shadows.\nArnold Hein!\n\u201cWell, what do you know.\u201d The man smiling so sweetly while their swords locked was the very man who had ended her life. \u201cYou do have some skill.\u201d\nMetal screeched and slid, before Arnold sheathed his sword. Rishe lowered hers. Neither looked away.\n\u201cWho the hell are you?\u201d demanded one of the knights.\n\u201cStand down, good sirs,\u201d Rishe said. \u201cYour interference will only make this worse.\u201d\nThis mostly served to befuddle the knights further. Rishe absolutely couldn\u2019t allow them to come to blows with the crown prince of a friendly nation. And they couldn\u2019t beat him\u2014not even if they took him all at once. Rishe had blocked his blow, but her arm was completely numb. To think he\u2019d be even more powerful in five years.\nHe regarded her unabashedly. \u201cRishe, was that your name? Where did you learn such swordsmanship?\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m afraid I cannot say. Besides, you were clearly going easy on me.\u201d\n\u201cHa! You could tell?\u201d\nArnold\u2019s manner was throwing her off. He seemed to be enjoying himself. He\u2019s laughing. This monstrous prince is\u2026actually laughing.\nWhen she had met him in her other life, he was cold and merciless, like a genuine monster. And yet here he stood, mellow and smiling.\nThe Emperor Arnold Hein I knew was twenty-four years old, so he\u2019s, what? Nineteen now? This is so weird. He\u2019s grinning like a boy getting into a scrape.\nThat attack had been good-natured as well, almost playful. It had muscle behind it but certainly not any lethal intent. He\u2019d just wanted to force Rishe to catch the blow. She found it unbelievable that he could exude such an overpowering air of menace when he was just messing around.\nWhile Rishe was focused on Arnold, Mary and Dietrich caught up, seemingly recovered.\n\u201cExcuse me, my lord!\u201d Mary squeaked. \u201cI-I-I don\u2019t know who you are, but kindly step away from Lady Rishe!\u201d\n\u201cYes, do as she says! Who the hell are you, anyway?!\u201d\nDon\u2019t tell me Prince Dietrich doesn\u2019t recognize one of his",
    "query_text": " personal guests.\nDietrich\u2019s interests did not lean toward diplomacy; he likely hadn\u2019t bothered to introduce himself to Arnold. Mary, for her part, seemed to grasp that Arnold wasn\u2019t ordinary. She stood up to defend Rishe, despite the tremble in her voice. In a better world, perhaps the two of them could have become friends.\n\u201cThat\u2019s your ex-fianc\u00e9?\u201d Arnold cocked a brow. \u201cHe\u2019s even worse than I imagined. Pathetic.\u201d\nDietrich flushed. \u201cI\u2019ll have your head!\u201d\n\u201cDietrich, I beg of you, contain yourself,\u201d Rishe said, then rounded on Arnold. \u201cAs for you, Your Highness\u2014you know who Dietrich is"

    "prefix_text": "\u2019re free to do business with whomever you wish.\u201d\n\u201cAfter we are married, I must be in a position to mingle with guests from abroad.\u201d\n\u201cThat sounds within the purview of the crown princess. Anything else?\u201d\n\u201cI will be allowed to live in a separate residence from your mother and father.\u201d\nShe meant this seriously, but it made Arnold laugh. \u201cYou don\u2019t seem the type to worry about an overbearing mother-in-law.\u201d\n\u201cYou would be surprised. Combative relationships with one\u2019s new family are the most difficult part of marriage, or so they say. It could be a ramshackle cottage for all I care\u2014I just require a secondary residence.\u201d\nActually, Rishe didn\u2019t care at all about in-laws. When Arnold set his war into motion, his first move would be the assassination of his father. A genuine coup by patricide, not at all like Dietrich\u2019s clumsy attempt. Next, he would name himself emperor, take control of the country, and mobilize the military.\nSeparating him from his parents will make the first step more difficult\u2014although not impossible, unfortunately.\n\u201cAnything else?\u201d Arnold asked. \u201cI\u2019ll do whatever it takes to marry you.\u201d\n\u201cIdeally, I\u2019d like to know your endgame,\u201d Rishe said with dignity. \u201cBut as I doubt there\u2019s any chance of that, I have one final request.\u201d She jabbed a finger into his face, regardless of how rude it was. \u201cI will spend my time idling around the castle. No work, no study. I shall be utterly useless.\u201d\nLet\u2019s see just how much you want me as your princess.\nAfter a long moment of silence, Arnold cracked a merry laugh. The proposal remained; all her conditions were met.\n\n(2) chapter number given is likely out of range: 0\nChapter: 7\n\nChapter 2\nChapter 2\n \n\u201cYOU KNOW, it was only after I went into commerce that I truly had a dream for the future,\u201d Rishe had once confided in a friend. \u201cUp until then, I existed only as the crown prince\u2019s fianc\u00e9e or my father\u2019s daughter. My every act was to become more worthy of that status. But now, for the first time, I actually have a goal of my own.\u201d\n\u201cOh, yeah?\u201d her friend said. He was the ruler of the desert kingdom, and his smile was awfully charming. \u201cWhat\u2019s that?\u201d\nRishe smiled back. \u201cI want to travel to every single country in the world. I want to see everything in every town, peruse their markets, and meet the eyes of every person who lives there!\u201d\nBy now, that felt like such a distant dream.\n \n***\n \nRishe awoke with a start, eyes snapping open as she sensed a disturbance in the air.\nShe unsheathed her sword halfway, primed for danger. \nInside the coach, her old enemy sat across from her, one hand outstretched. \u201cWhat do you think you\u2019re doing?\u201d she demanded.\nWhen they\u2019d boarded the coach, Rishe had warned him not to lay a single finger on her throughout the trip to his kingdom. Ordering the prince not to touch his consort was absurd, but Arnold readily agreed. He had, after all, promised to follow her every direction.\nAnd yet, here he was, already breaking his promise.\nArnold appeared unperturbed by her glare. \u201cDon\u2019t look at me like that. I was merely trying to recover what you took from me.\u201d\nConfused, Rishe looked at the sword in her hand. It had a black lacquered scabbard with a simple golden decoration. Engraved on the hilt was the Galkhein crest.\n\u201cOh!\u201d Rishe thrust the sword back at Arnold. \u201cMy apologies.\u201d\nArnold chuckled. \u201cYou caught me off guard. You were nodding off, and then you suddenly snatched up my sword. You looked quite content snuggling up with it.\u201d\nArnold propped the sword beside him. Rishe pressed a hand to her chest to quell her racing heart. The sword that gutted me in my previous life is now my bedmate. What a world. Her recent stint as a knight had left her ill at ease without a blade at hand. She just couldn\u2019t believe it was Arnold\u2019s she\u2019d reached for.\n\u201cI didn\u2019t mean to disturb you, but I doubted sleeping with a weapon would be comfortable. I\u2019m impressed you sensed my intent before I even touched you.\u201d Arnold rested one elbow against the window frame, watching her with shameless fascination. \u201cOne only develops instincts like that from combat training. And you were also a member of the court? How in the world did you find the time?\u201d\nRishe shrugged. She couldn\u2019t just say, I pretended to be a man in a previous life, that\u2019s how.\n\u201cI assume there\u2019s more to you than your devotion to the sword. You seem to like flowers.\u201d\nShe followed Arnold\u2019s gaze to where she\u2019d bundled a small bouquet in a handkerchief. This was their fifth day on the road to Galkhein. Every day, without fail, she\u2019d picked flowers whenever they stopped to water the horses. The ones from today were still fresh, but the ones she\u2019d begun drying five days ago were just about ready.\n\u201cI didn\u2019t pick these because they\u2019re pretty.\u201d Rishe brought the blooms to her face, spirits rising at their sweet scent. Spring wildflowers had a soft and gentle smell. Rishe looked out the window at the forest spreading toward Galkhein, thinking of the rare native flowers going into bloom. She wished she could pick those as well, but that would cause too much delay. She gazed on wistfully.\nAfter watching her in silence for some time, Arnold said, \u201cBy the way, I sent one of my men ahead on a fast horse to deliver your order to the company you requested. They\u2019ll be invited to Galkhein to discuss the wedding ceremony.\u201d\n\u201cThank you,\u201d Rishe said. \u201cI\u2019m glad you kept your word.\u201d\n\u201cThe Aria Trading Company,\u201d Arnold mused. \u201cI\u2019ve heard of them. They\u2019re up-and-comers, aren\u2019t they? Have you done business with them before?\u201d\n\u201cNo, but I heard from a friend that they hold a very high standard of quality.\u201d\nRishe was pleasantly surprised at how easily Arnold had acceded to her request. Typically, a royal household had their own personal dealer. Getting them to do business with someone else could be difficult.\nI want to establish a connection with Aria as soon as possible, Rishe thought. It was, of course, the company that had taken her in during her first life.\nThe company had been established just two years prior to picking her up by its owner, a man named Tully. They were still in their growth stage, but in just a few years, they would be the grandest trading company in all the world. They\u2019d proven a great boon in her life as an apothecary as well, helping to distribute her newest medicines. She\u2019d struggled to win their trust initially, but she pledged to work much harder this time around.\nThis marriage isn\u2019t going to happen\u2014I need an escape plan for when it all falls apart. I must bring to bear all my knowledge and influence as a crown princess.\nRishe didn\u2019t know Arnold\u2019s plans, but she had no intention of sitting around and waiting for him to use her as he pleased. She\u2019d spend her time as his consort wisely. Everything must serve her ultimate goal: to live longer than five years, and live well.\nHer fierce determination must have shown on her face because Arnold gave her a little bemused smile. \u201cYes?\u201d\nGod! Rishe grimaced at that flawlessly handsome countenance. Such beauty, possessed by such powerful destruction. The fact that he\u2019d been the man to kill her did nothing to lessen her fascination. In fact, it almost made it worse. The study of contrasts.\n\u201cSorry, I just\u2014\u201d\nShe was interrupted by the horses\u2019 loud whinnies.\n\u201cStop! Hey, stop the coach!\u201d\nShouts drifted back from conveyance ahead of theirs, which contained the luggage and attendants. The squadron of knights tailing the column of coaches sped off toward the front.\n\u201cWho do you think you\u2014graaargh!\u201d\nThat didn\u2019t sound good. Rishe moved to climb out, but Arnold was faster. He drew his sword.\n\u201cHey!\u201d\nArnold locked the door from the outside. \u201cStay hidden.\u201d\nWhy is he putting himself in danger? That\u2019s what knights are for! The fact that Rishe had been about to do the same thing didn\u2019t occur to her. It\u2019s probably bandits. He told me to stay hidden in here, but I\u2019m not so sure about that.\nArnold had left her locked in from the outside, hoping to keep her safe, but Rishe didn\u2019t like her odds. There were five coaches, but this one was certainly the grandest. It locked on the inside as well, but that wouldn\u2019t stop someone with enough determination. If she did as she was told, she\u2019d just be waiting patiently for a bandit to break a window and drag her out.\nKeeping one eye on the coachmen fleeing into the forest, Rishe began a methodical search for something to help her. Right\u2014her hairpin!\nThis sure brings me back. She unfastened it, twisting it into the gap in the door. Back when I was a maid, my lady would lock herself in her chambers all the time to avoid her studies. I had to break her out just like this.\nThe lock on the coach was simple, and it came open easily. Once she was free, she scanned her surroundings. She didn\u2019t see anyone who looked immediately hostile, but there was noise up ahead. Cautiously, she headed toward it.\nBefore long, she found Arnold.\nWow.\nRoughly ten men\u2014the bandits, she presumed\u2014lay crumpled on the ground. In their midst stood Arnold, in the process of tripping another man into the dirt. He scowled, blade at the man\u2019s throat. \u201cIs that it, then?\u201d\n\u201cGwugh!\u201d\nArnold kicked the bandit in the stomach, eyes blazing with cruelty. \u201cThat\u2019s all the thrill you offer me after I went to the trouble of drawing my sword? Barely worth it. I\u2019m bored already.\u201d\nHe wasn\u2019t angry; on the contrary, he stared his enemies down with chilly disappointment, as if this had all been a letdown. Even Arnold\u2019s own knights seemed terrified of their master when he was in a mood. Arnold smoothly flicked the blood off his sword, wiping the blade on the bandit\u2019s shirt before sheathing it. The rest of the men on the ground seemed to be unconscious.\nWait, he didn\u2019t kill anyone? Why not? Is it because we haven\u2019t reached Galkhein?\nShe supposed even Arnold knew better than to go around killing the citizens of other countries. Or perhaps he had yet to become the ruthless monster she knew him as.\nArnold seemed to sense her gaze, turning around with a start. Genuine emotion bloomed on his face, worlds away from the blank mask he wore to face down the bandits. \u201cHow did you get out of the coach?\u201d\nRishe shrugged. \u201cIf I tell you, you\u2019ll be able to prevent me from doing it again.\u201d\nArnold snickered. \u201cYou continue to amaze me.\u201d\nHow can you go from ice-cold to suddenly looking like a normal nineteen-year-old? It\u2019s disconcerting. \nRishe fought down her disquiet as a man alighted from a coach and shouted, \u201cYour Highness! Not again!\u201d He was Oliver, one of the prince\u2019s attendants. He had silver hair and was roughly as tall as Arnold.\n\u201cWhat do you think all these knights are for, decoration? Why do you insist on endangering yourself?\u201d\nRishe had only met Oliver briefly a few days ago, but he didn\u2019t appear to be intimidated by Arnold at all. And, well\u2026he\u2019s not wrong.\nShe feared the menace would return to Arnold\u2019s expression, but he just looked annoyed. \u201cI could tell they were prepared to kill. I\u2019d prefer to take the burden on myself than risk multiple injuries so far afield. And we already have casualties.\u201d\nHe was right. Several injured knights leaned listlessly among the trees. Arnold issued orders to those still able-bodied. \u201cFirst squad, see to the wounded. Second squad, arrest these men.\u201d\n\u201cYes, sir!\u201d\nOliver appeared unsatisfied. \u201cYour Highness, that is a weak justification. I\u2019m overjoyed you\u2019re well, but you must consider Lady Rishe. Perhaps next time we run into a team of murderous brigands, you could allow your consort to remain in the coach.\u201d\n\u201cI told her to remain in the coach!\u201d\nRishe quickly averted her gaze, turning her attention to the wounded knights. They didn\u2019t appear badly injured, yet they all seemed exhausted.\n\u201cExcuse me, can I take a look?\u201d Rishe approached the knight acting as a medic. He looked round, startled by her presence.\n\u201cNonsense, my lady. Don\u2019t trouble yourself, you must have had quite a scare.\u201d\nThis was not unreasonable, but the wariness in his eyes made it clear he wanted her nowhere near his comrade. He isn\u2019t just being polite. He truly is on guard. \nBeside them, an injured knight groaned as another helped him up. \u201cWhat\u2019s wrong with you?\u201d the second knight asked the first. \n\u201cI-I feel\u2026numb.\u201d\n\u201cWhat? Damn.\u201d The knight grabbed up one of the fallen bandit\u2019s swords, going pale as he inspected the blade. \u201cYour Highness, look at this. Poison.\u201d\nArnold clicked his tongue. \u201cLocate every laceration and bind them close to the heart. Suck the poison from the wounds.\u201d\nHe mostly got that right, at least. In the meantime, Rishe located the nearest bound bandit and pulled his dagger out of its sheath. Its wet coating gleamed in the sunlight, just as the knight had said.\nThey applied the poison liberally\u2014whatever it is must be cheap and easily bought in bulk.\nShe wafted the smell toward her, bracing for something rancid, but detected nothing. Then she brought it closer to her nose.\nIt smells sweet, like an overripe apple. Shea grass and\u2026bluecap mushrooms. All the knights appear to have the same symptoms, so I won\u2019t have to check every blade.\nRishe stood back up and headed for the coach.\nOliver took a step after her. \u201cYour Highness, Lady Rishe is\u2014\u201d\n\u201cLeave her. She may do as she pleases.\u201d\n\u201cShe\u2019s well trained,\u201d Oliver mused. \u201cBut a battlefield is no place for a young lady. She probably wasn\u2019t prepared for such a dreadful spectacle.\u201d\nRishe ignored the murmurs and focused on her work. There they are. I\u2019ll take these, these, and\u2026\n\u201cThe poison must be a sleeping drug,\u201d she overheard Arnold saying. \u201cHunters use such drugs to weaken larger prey. I doubt this dose is lethal.\u201d\n\u201cBut it certainly is annoying,\u201d replied Oliver. \u201cWe\u2019re still two days out from Galkhein. Lugging a company of sleeping men in armor won\u2019t be pleasant.\u201d\n\u201cWe\u2019ll have to stop somewhere nearby. A hunter\u2019s settlement. Perhaps they will have an antidote\u2014\u201d\n\u201cExcuse me.\u201d Rishe, who\u2019d returned from the carriage, raised a hand. \u201cI have an antidote.\u201d\n\u201cWhat?\u201d\nThe entire company stared at her in awe.\n \n***\n \nAs it turned out, Arnold\u2019s guess was right. \nThis sweet-smelling substance was a hunter\u2019s drug, made from ingredients that were only toxic in their raw form. Heat rendered them harmless. Rishe had encountered this poison several times before, curing a customer afflicted with it during her life as an apothecary.\n\u201cA lethal dose for a grown man would fill a wine glass. They likely got less than a hundredth of that,\u201d Rishe explained",

It\u2019s best to lay them on their sides.\u201d\n\u201cYes, I understand the theory and the solution.\u201d Arnold gazed down at Rishe\u2019s hands. \u201cThe part I\u2019m struggling with is why you\u2019re the one telling me this.\u201d\n\u201cWell, I know how to make the antidote,\u201d Rishe said patiently as she muddled the herbs together in the white soup bowl she\u2019d borrowed for her flowers.

I will do everything in my power to protect you, but you must bring any insults or threats to me right away.\u201d\n\u201cAre there likely to be many?\u201d\n\u201cIn theory, the crown prince may choose his own wife, but the done thing is, of course, to marry a princess. I assume a duke\u2019s daughter would have at least some ties to the royal family?\u201d\nHe assumed correctly. She was in the family tree, if a rather distant branch.\n\u201cMy father has ordered me to choose a bride from a different kingdom rather than a woman of my own land because\u2014\u201d\n\u201cOne never knows when a hostage will come in handy,\u201d Rishe finished for him.\nGalkhein was an expansionist empire. Currently, peace reigned\u2014but peace was precarious. If Galkhein demanded any of the countries to hand over a princess bride, then none were in a position to refuse. With his daughter in the hands of a foreign power, no king would dare oppose a war that power cared to wage.\n\u201cI sent a message to my father telling him I happened upon a close relation of Hermity\u2019s king\u2014a duke\u2019s daughter who had been recently tossed aside by her fianc\u00e9e,\u201d Arnold said. \u201cI also may have implied I was the reason for your falling out\u2014yours and the prince\u2019s. Why, when I saw a woman so powerful and connected and beloved, I couldn\u2019t help but plunder you.\u201d\n\u201cPlunder me? That\u2019s certainly one way to describe it.\u201d Dietrich had kicked up an almighty fuss, despite being the one who broke the engagement.\n\u201cMy father approves of you because he sees you as a bargaining chip. There will be others who aren\u2019t prepared to accept you so willingly.\u201d\n\u201cIs that so?\u201d Rishe said steadily.\n\u201cNever fear,\u201d Arnold responded. \u201cThey\u2019ll eat their words, every one of them. They will receive you as their crown princess if they value their\u2014\u201d\n\u201cNo, being a hostage is perfect.\u201d \nArnold stared at her. \u201cHm?\u201d\n\u201cAs a hostage, I\u2019ll have no official duties, will I? We can pretend I\u2019m here only under great duress, and there will be no need for my comment on governmental or diplomatic affairs.\u201d\nArnold hesitated. \u201cI suppose not.\u201d\n\u201cExcellent! Then I can live my dream of being utterly useless.\u201d Rishe trembled with delight. The thought of acting as an ambassador had really been weighing on her mind. Being a princess was nonstop work. Having been groomed for the position from an early age, Rishe knew members of the royal family barely even had time to sleep.\nBut prisoners didn\u2019t have places in government.\n\u201cThis is such a weight off my mind,\u201d Rishe admitted. \u201cThank you so much for keeping your promise, Your Highness.\u201d\n\u201cEr, of course.\u201d\n\u201cBut don\u2019t worry, I won\u2019t shirk my duties as wedding planner.\u201d Nearly ready to collapse with relief, Rishe returned to her herbs.\n \n***\n \nAfter the bandit incident, Rishe felt the knights begin to ease a bit in her presence.\nDespite their initial reluctance to accept her help, they continued to report the injured men\u2019s progress and bring any concerns directly to her. In return, they took over gathering herbs from the surrounding countryside on their rest stops.\nShe hadn\u2019t done it for gratitude, but she was nonetheless touched. Gathering medicinal herbs had been second nature ever since her life as an apothecary, and it was foolish to ever turn down loyalty.\nSeveral days after the altercation with the bandits, the coach train finally arrived in the imperial capital of Galkhein.\n\u201cOh my,\u201d Rishe murmured as they passed through the gates.\nWhite stone buildings stood in straight rows, lining clean, orderly streets. The first stories all appeared to be shops, while the second-floor windows were festooned with flowers. Everywhere she looked were smiling faces, citizens turned out to witness their prince\u2019s return over the smooth brick roads. Overlooking it all was the towering magnificence of the imperial palace.\n\u201cThe capital is the seat of power in Galkhein,\u201d Arnold explained. \u201cSeveral key trade routes converge here.\u201d\nRishe nodded, suddenly anxious to be out of the coach. More and more people were gathering to watch their progress, some carrying shopping bags in both arms or holding hands with children. Many of them waved, as if greeting someone dear to them.\nHappy citizens and clean, orderly streets meant wealth. Galkhein was well-off. Rishe couldn\u2019t help but grin at an adorable little girl watching them roll by with sparkling eyes. When she saw Rishe\u2019s smile, she blushed and leapt up in the air, laughing with delight.\nThe coach made its way through the city before passing through the castle gates. Lines of disciplined knights flanked the road, ready to greet the crown prince and his fianc\u00e9e.\nArnold stepped out of the coach, holding out his hand to Rishe. She took it reflexively as she alighted. A prince would be expected to help any lady out of carriage, never mind his own consort, yet for some reason the knights looked a bit disturbed.\nRishe shot them back of look of innocent confusion.\n\u201cOur long journey is at last at its end, Your Highness, Lady Rishe.\u201d Oliver emerged from the ranks of the knights, bowing. He shot Arnold a curious glance. \u201cHow novel to see you taking the hand of your fianc\u00e9e.\u201d\nAh! Rishe realized that she herself had willingly broken the condition that she had imposed. Arnold had offered his hand, but she was the one who accepted.\nArnold gave a little laugh of triumph. Rishe felt a rush of frustration at being tricked. \nOliver stared at them before leaning in to whisper in Arnold\u2019s ear. Arnold let out a breath of annoyance. \n\u201cIs something the matter?\u201d Rishe asked.\n\u201cI sent orders ahead to have a detached wing of the palace prepared for us, but it seems the preparations are behind schedule. I\u2019m sorry, but you\u2019ll need to stay in a guest room in the main palace for a few days.\u201d\n\u201cOh, I don\u2019t mind if the wing isn\u2019t ready,\u201d Rishe said. \u201cWe can head over there now.\u201d\n\u201cIt hasn\u2019t been used in quite a while. It\u2019ll be covered in dust.\u201d\n\u201cI said that I didn\u2019t mind if it was a mess, remember? But there\u2019s no need for you to put yourself out. By all means, stay in the main palace for as long as you need.\u201d Rishe had spent a life as a maid\u2014dust didn\u2019t scare her. \u201cBesides, I\u2019m a hostage, after all.\u201d\n\u201cYou could at least attempt to sound distressed,\u201d Arnold said with the slightest trace of petulance. \nRishe, who had a huge grin spreading over her face and her chest puffed out with pride, didn\u2019t respond.\n \n***\n \nThe detached wing turned out to be just a separate palace in the distant corner of the grounds\u2014a scant four stories tall and, as advertised, absolutely swimming in dust.\nNot so bad, though. Rishe had pictured decay and clutter, but it was mostly just bare. Bare and musty, but not rotten or falling apart.\n\u201cYou can do whatever you want with this place. I\u2019ll be occupied over the next few days, but feel free to use the guest apartments in the main palace if you get tired of choking to death,\u201d Arnold said before he left.\nAccording to Oliver, work had piled up while the prince was away, and it wasn\u2019t just a few things that could be dispensed with over a few days working around the clock.\nEmperor Arnold Hein\u2026 He\u2019s just a crown prince right now, but I still wish I knew what\u2019s going on in his head. For now, I\u2019ll just focus on what I can do. Like make this place livable.\nShe changed into her plainest dress and rolled up her sleeves. The knights who\u2019d remained to serve as her guard kept watch over her as she went from window to window, throwing them all open.\nIn a stroke of luck, the weather was good, and the detached wing was well placed to soak up the sun. The lack of any creature comforts made it look ascetic and drab, but once it was furnished, Rishe had no doubt it would be lovely.\nLeaving the top floors to air out, Rishe found the stairs to the basement. She pushed the heavy wooden doors open, and mice skittered over her feet. The knights yelped as Rishe descended into the darkness.\n\u201cL-Lady Rishe, why are you going down here?\u201d\n\u201cCleaning supplies are usually kept in the basement. See?\u201d\nThe knights followed her gaze to a duster, broom, dustpan, and pile of fresh cloths. She filled a bucket with water and went to work, rolling up a handkerchief to cover her mouth as she swept dust down from high on the walls. Then she swept up all the dust on the floor.\nIt\u2019s always satisfying to tackle a place this filthy.\nShe corralled the dust bunnies until they were piled up like snow in the center of the hall, and then she swept them out the open door. Once the floors were free of debris, she attacked them with the cloth.\n\u201cLady Rishe, is there anything we can do to help?\nRishe was grateful for the knight\u2019s offer, but she shook her head. \u201cYour job is to guard me, not do my housekeeping.\u201d\n\u201cThis is quite the place to clean on your own, detached though it may be,\u201d the knight said hesitantly. \u201cIt\u2019s not too late to move into the guest chambers instead.\u201d\n\u201cThat\u2019s all right. I like the place already.\u201d\nRishe remained steadfast in her refusal for one reason: readying guest chambers was an awful chore. The palace maids would be expected to work overnight to prepare them, even if the guests were only staying a single night. No speck of dust or strand of hair could remain. Certainly no wrinkled sheets. Rishe knew how exhausting and rigorous a maid\u2019s job was, how nerve-racking.\nShe refused to put the poor dears through such an ordeal for just a few days\u2019 stay. From the sound of things, the palace wasn\u2019t equipped with many housemaids. No doubt they already had their hands full.\n\u201cBesides, take a look.\u201d She held out her arms wide, gesturing to her sparkling clean floor. The knights stared at the bright room in admiration. \u201cCleaning a place with your own hands makes living there that much more satisfying, you see.\u201d\nThe knights smiled their awkward but good-natured agreement.\nRishe worked tirelessly, and before long, the chambers where she would spend the night were ready. The knights offered to carry in the bed, which she allowed.\nWhile they brought in furniture, Rishe started cleaning another room. She had run out of clean water, so she quietly slipped out to the well without informing the knights. It wasn\u2019t quite fair to them, but these were the palace grounds. Surely she didn\u2019t need to be chaperoned everywhere.\nBesides, they\u2019re guards in name only. They\u2019re clearly just here to report my movements to Arnold Hein, Rishe reflected as she walked through a courtyard full of flowers, bucket in hand. Iridescent butterflies cavorted playfully around her feet. He doesn\u2019t seem in a hurry to introduce me to the king. Although if I\u2019m just a hostage, that doesn\u2019t surprise me.\nShe hoped she got to meet the current emperor at least once. The future Arnold\u2019s violent conquest only began after he killed the man and made himself emperor, after all.\nI wonder what happened to Arnold Hein after I died in my past life. Did he reign supreme after winning his war? Or did some country manage to put a stop to his conquest? Whatever the case, I absolutely cannot allow him to start a conflict this time. Being the empress of a wartime nation sounds like so much work! The very thought is unacceptable!\nPerhaps they could divorce, but Rishe had a feeling that if Arnold decided to discard her in the middle of a war, she would fail in her mission to make it past the age of twenty. Better to avoid the situation all together.\nWait. When she thought about it, the cause of every single one of Rishe\u2019s deaths was Arnold and his war. I died fighting. I died when Galkhein\u2019s army invaded\u2026\nLooking at her six lives, all of them had ended in more or less the same way.\nRishe found herself crouched on the ground, cradling her head in her hands. Maybe we should get a divorce right now. But it wasn\u2019t in Rishe\u2019s nature to take back her decisions once she\u2019d made them. \nIf I leave, I\u2019ll probably just die in some war-related disaster again. If I can\u2019t live apart from him, I should take this opportunity to learn everything that I can. \nRishe didn\u2019t know the cause of her repeating lives, but there was no guarantee that the loops were infinite. She had to operate under the possibility that this life could be her last. This required some thought, but standing around seething with anxiety wouldn\u2019t help.\nRight now I\u2019ll focus on cleaning. Once the bath is here, I\u2019ll scrub off all the dust and travel exhaustion. And then I can finally relax! \nBrimming with new determination, she stood up and headed for the well. She was forestalled by the sound of jeering giggles. \n\u201cAww, look at the new girl, trying so hard,\u201d said one voice.\n\u201cAll the enthusiasm in the world won\u2019t make a difference,\u201d said another. \u201cWe\u2019re going to be the crown princess\u2019s maids, not you.\u201d\nThe first added, \u201cHey, are you even listening? Stop wasting your time!\u201d\nRishe heard a weak scream, followed by a thump, like a body hitting the ground. She broke into a run, finding a blonde girl sprawled in the dirt, surrounded by four other women.\n\u201cAre you all right?\u201d Rishe hurried over to help the girl up. Her maid\u2019s uniform\u2014a loose navy-blue dress with a white apron\u2014was smeared with mud. The others were dressed identically.\n\u201cWho are you?\u201d one of the girls snapped at Rishe. She had a mop of blazing-red hair. \u201cAnother newbie?\u201d\nAn understandable mistake. Rishe\u2019s dress was simple, free of ornamentation, and her hair was bound back in a ponytail to keep it out of the way. She was dust-streaked, sweaty, and carrying a bucket in her arms.\nTelling them who I am will be more trouble than it\u2019s worth. Her silence only angered the girls more.\n\u201cAre you one of the crown princess\u2019s maids? They\u2019ve been snatching up every new girl. Those pretty hands of yours don\u2019t look like they\u2019ve ever held a broom,\u201d said one of them.\n\u201cUnfortunately for you, we\u2019ve been working here three years, and we\u2019ll be the ones to serve Prince Arnold as the maids of his palace.\u201d\n\u201cCan you stand? Oh, good, it looks like you\u2019re not injured.\u201d Rishe helped the girl up out of the dirt. \n\u201cHey, don\u2019t ignore us!\u201d the redheaded maid shouted. \u201cYou\u2019ve got some nerve. If you want to make it here, you\u2019ll know your place! I doubt the two of you will last a week!\u201d\nRishe didn\u2019t respond, her attention snagging on something else. The redhead was carrying curtains, probably to bring them to the wash. Rishe stared at them",
    "query_text": " so hard the maid began to shift uncomfortably. \u201cWhat\u2019s your problem?\u201d\n\u201cYou should wait to wash those,\u201d Rishe said.\nThe girl glared daggers at her. \u201cExcuse me? Are you telling me it\u2019s too late in the day? You really are an amateur! The light lasts longer in the spring, you know. And it\u2019s hot today. There\u2019ll be plenty of\u2014\u201d \n\u201cIt\u2019s going to rain, is all.\u201d\nThe maids exchanged glances. \u201cHow can you be so sure?\u201d\n\u201cLook at the clouds amassing. The butterflies and the bees are flying low. The moisture in the air will make the drying take longer.\u201d\n\u201cWhat?\u201d\nAnother maid spoke up in a soft voice. \u201cDiana, you were the one who said we should take the initiative to wash the bigger pieces. You said the crown prince would choose us for his household!\u201d\n\u201cStop"

I don\u2019t know any girls of your class with the knowledge or the physical abilities you possess. Noblewomen don\u2019t concern themselves with such things.\u201d\nRishe, there is no need for you to think for yourself.\nShe frowned. \u201cPerhaps you\u2019re right, but everything I\u2019ve learned is precious to me. No one can take my skills away\u2014I value them with my life. Some may say that my knowledge is worthless, but it makes no difference to me.\u201d She turned from the balcony, fixing him with a piercing gaze. \u201cI\u2019m the one who decides what I value.\u201d\nRishe had clawed free of her mother and father\u2019s indoctrination a long time ago. Man, woman\u2014it didn\u2019t matter. She could do anything. Being queen was not the culmination of her life; she wouldn\u2019t trade her freedom for anything.\nArnold matched her intensity. \u201cYou\u2019re right.\u201d He gently cupped her cheek in a one hand, swiping his thumb along the line of her jaw, smearing dust. \u201cLive your life here however you wish. I vow to do my utmost to protect you.\u201d\n\u201cHuh?\u201d\nHis vehemence took her by surprise. Arnold had every right to demand she act the part of a proper consort. This was a political marriage; Rishe was essentially a hostage, after all. Yet here he was, cosigning her misbehavior. Moreover, he was all but swearing to defend her from the consequences.\n\u201cWhy?\u201d\n\u201cYou know why. I\u2019m enamored with you.\u201d Arnold fed her the same line. \u201cI know you said you don\u2019t care about other people\u2019s approval, but I like your asymmetrical talents. I don\u2019t find them useless at all.\u201d \nRishe didn\u2019t know how to respond.\n\u201cI thought I\u2019d already made that clear.\u201d He took his hand back, drawing away, stopping just on the threshold. He turned back to a stunned Rishe and said, \u201cLet me know if there\u2019s anything you desire. I realize I just broke our agreement\u2014the one about not touching you.\u201d\nAnd with that, he was gone.\nShaken, Rishe sank to the floor of the balcony. I can\u2019t predict him at all! Just what is Arnold Hein planning?\nThe quiet of evening fell over the imperial capital of Galkhein.\n \n***\n \n\u201cMmm.\u201d\nSunshine streamed through the window as Rishe roused from sleep. She rolled over, basking in the morning light. The wall she expected wasn\u2019t there, and the bed seemed larger than usual. Taking advantage of it, she stretched out as far as she could.\nWas this her chamber at home? Or maybe she was a merchant again, spending a night at the desert king\u2019s palace. Perhaps this was her bed of straw from her life as a maid? Her memories met and interwove as she drifted into wakefulness.\nWhen Rishe finally opened her eyes, she grew even more confused.\nLight blue curtains surrounded the bed, thin enough to allow sunlight to pass through. She pulled them aside to find herself in a bare room devoid of furniture and carpet.\nOh, right. She didn\u2019t need to report for morning training, tend to her herb garden, prepare breakfast, or see how the bottles she had brewed overnight were coming along.\nRealizing that, Rishe buried her face in the pillow. \u201cSo soft,\u201d she murmured. \nJudging by the position of the sun, it was about six o\u2019clock in the morning. She was pretty sure she had gone to bed around midnight last night.\nI slept for six whole hours? Rishe couldn\u2019t believe it. Generally, she was used to getting about four hours of sleep. On bad days, at the height of an emergency as a knight or apothecary, she wouldn\u2019t even get that much. \nI\u2019ve got nothing but cleaning on the schedule today. Hostages can sleep in, right? At least a little? Excitement suffused her at the thought, but that was interrupted by a knock on the door.\n\u201cLady Rishe, are you awake? It\u2019s Oliver\u2014Prince Arnold\u2019s attendant.\u201d\nRishe sat up with a start. \u201cI\u2019m awake!\u201d\nOliver continued to speak through the door. \u201cI apologize for bothering you at such an early hour. I\u2019m here with a delivery.\u201d\n\u201cJust a moment!\u201d Rishe slipped out of the bed, dressed quickly, and tugged the bed\u2019s canopy closed. She opened the door to find Oliver standing in the hallway with a polite smile.\nHe apologized again. \u201cThis was the only time I could slip away from His Highness\u2019s office. I\u2019m glad to see that you\u2019re already dressed.\u201d\n\u201cNot at all.\u201d Rishe paused, stepping back to allow him inside. \u201cOh my. You look exhausted.\u201d\nOliver grimaced. \u201cIs it that obvious? We\u2019ve been climbing through mountains of paperwork, but never mind me. His Highness has been working around the clock.\u201d\nRishe thought back to yesterday, how he had come all the way out to the balcony. He should have used that spare time to sleep. \u201cHe\u2019s in high demand, isn\u2019t he? He was even working on the trip over.\u201d\n\u201cHe finished all the work he brought along with us,\u201d Oliver confirmed. \u201cNow he\u2019s dealing with everything that piled up during his visit to Hermity.\u201d\n\u201cOh.\u201d Rishe grimaced in sympathy. He may have killed her in a past life,",
    "query_text": " but she wouldn\u2019t wish the bureaucracy of kingship on anyone. \u201cIt\u2019s a shame he had to put his work on hold to attend a silly engagement party.\u201d\n\u201cNo matter. That party was how a committed bachelor finally found a bride.\u201d\nHis smile was sincere, but Rishe knew better. She spread her arms. \u201cGo on. Shall I spin around so you have a better view?\u201d\nOliver blinked."

    "prefix_text": " while feeling out for moments of weakness. Arnold played along with her game, completely unruffled.\nEvery single time. I\u2019m doing my utmost to trip him up, but he doesn\u2019t even seem annoyed! At this point she\u2019d just settle for any reaction at all.\nTheir unusual dance style had gathered a crowd. Rishe paid them no mind, focused only on her goal. Then something occurred to her, and her breath caught in her throat.\nWait a minute, he has left an opening. It\u2019s the same one from before. She thought back to their fight to the death, to that moment when she had managed to draw blood. That may indeed have been his only weakness.\nIf I strike the same way\u2014huh? Before she could try, Arnold appeared to lose patience, wrapping his arm around her waist. He bent her back into a dip so deep it felt like he\u2019d pulled a carpet from under her feet. She yelped, grabbing at him reflexively, clinging tight. His big hands gripped her securely enough to mitigate the sensation of falling. Relief flooded through her, and she felt a laugh rumble against her ear.\nThe music came to an end with one last ringing note. She blinked. The dance is over?\nA hush fell over the ballroom. Then cheers broke out, followed by a round of applause.\n\u201cThat was incredible!\u201d\nThe watching nobles crowded in.\n\u201cYou two moved in such perfect harmony!\u201d\n\u201cI was on the edge of my seat. I felt like I was watching a sword duel!\u201d\n\u201cIs this a dance from Hermity? I\u2019ve never seen such steps before.\u201d\n\u201cUh, well\u2026\u201d Rishe floundered. She glanced up at Arnold, who appeared to be enjoying her struggle. She\u2019d get no help from him.\nRishe dealt with the barrage of questions as best she could, letting the crowd sweep them into the dining room, which was set up for a buffet-style meal. She made sure to greet every guest, riveting their faces into her memory.\nShe must have been acting peculiar, because Arnold eventually said, \u201cRishe, I think the wine is getting to you. Shall we get some fresh air?\u201d\nRishe hadn\u2019t touched a single drop. In fact, she\u2019d been caught up in so many conversations that she hadn\u2019t even had the chance to eat, but she had experience working on an empty stomach. She accepted Arnold\u2019s encouragement as the escape it was.\nJust when I least expect it, he\u2019ll act the gentleman. Maybe he\u2019d remembered her demand for a carefree life of doing nothing.\nRishe cast a charming look across the crowd. \u201cThank you for your consideration, Your Highness. Forgive me.\u201d She gave a polite bow before quietly slipping away. \nShe didn\u2019t head straight to the balcony but rather slowly walked around the hall. There was only so much she could find out glued to Arnold\u2019s side all night.\nI need information. Galkhein\u2019s political landscape was a mystery to me through all my past lives. I only know the rumors that made it abroad.\nAlthough she knew of Arnold\u2019s eventual patricide, she had no concept of the circumstances leading up to it. She needed a better picture of the factions and power balance inside the court. The lives these people led.\nI know better than to believe wartime gossip. This Arnold Hein is a lot different from what I\u2019d heard he was like at nineteen. He\u2019s not as diabolical as the rumors led me to believe. He likes to push, but he isn\u2019t unkind. The thought drifted across her mind, leaving her conflicted. Well, he\u2019s not unkind now. But I still don\u2019t like not knowing his motives. And he\u2019s a bit of a jerk, to be honest. \nShe tried to settle her mind and just observe. Gathering intelligence was necessary to lead a long, carefree life lazing around the palace.\nIf I recall correctly, that\u2019s Lord Hannawald. He seems to be on good terms with Count Gayle. Duke Hudemann and Duke Teinitz are having a friendly enough conversation, yet they don\u2019t seem close. Rishe ticked off the names of people she\u2019d met, committing them to memory.\nA wave of sweet perfume wafted over her. A pretty girl with soft blonde hair had appeared at her side. \u201cHow do you do, Lady Rishe? I\u2019m Cornelia Thea Toona.\u201d\nDuke Toona\u2019s family was the thirty-first house she\u2019d met tonight.\nRishe smiled graciously. \u201cRishe Irmgard Weitzner. A pleasure to meet you.\u201d\n\u201cThe pleasure is all mine.\u201d Cornelia smiled sweetly. Her eyes were big and bright, her lips full. She held a glass in each hand and offered one to Rishe. \u201cWine? I see you\u2019re empty-handed.\u201d\nA gaggle of other ladies nearby began giggling among themselves.\n\u201cHow dare she act so haughty when she\u2019s a captive. It\u2019s time for her learn just what she is. A pawn to be played and discarded.\u201d\n\u201cShe should enjoy her time on Prince Arnold\u2019s arm while she can.\u201d\n\u201cShe is from a minor nation, after all.\u201d\nAs Rishe took note of their whispers, Cornelia gazed at her with doe eyes. \u201cDoes my offering offend you in some way?\u201d\nIf I remember correctly, House Toona holds a vast territory in southern Galkhein.\nRishe held out a hand to accept the glass. \u201cHow could it? Thank you, Lady Cornelia.\u201d\nBefore Rishe could touch the glass, Cornelia gave a dramatic shout. \u201cOh dear! My hand slipped!\u201d She dropped it, quite obviously on purpose. Without thinking, Rishe grabbed her skirts and leaned back, plucking the glass out of the air with the other hand.\nCornelia let out a cry of surprise as Rishe caught the wine before any could spill. She swirled the glass and brought it to her nose to breathe in the bouquet.\nHmm\u2026 That\u2019s mashed capsicum. Where did she even get that? What a waste of perfectly good wine. And why bother spicing it enough to singe the tongue if she just planned to ruin my dress? Pick a plan, my dear.\nHiding her exasperation, Rishe smiled brightly. \u201cI\u2019ve never had a wine quite like this. What an unusual scent.\u201d\nCornelia bit her lip in frustration. Rishe beamed at her. You\u2019ve got such a pretty face, Lady Toona. Why don\u2019t you smile?\nRishe leaned in close to Cornelia. \u201cThis vintage isn\u2019t available where I\u2019m from. I\u2019m ever so anxious to learn more. Should I perhaps invite Prince Arnold over to enjoy a glass? Which tray did you get this from?\u201d\n\u201cWhat? Oh, um\u2026\u201d Rishe had a policy of never backing down from a fight, but it seemed Cornelia didn\u2019t share it. \u201cS-sorry, but I don\u2019t remember. Such a large hall, you see.\u201d\n\u201cA shame. I\u2019ll just give His Highness this one, then. I\u2019ll be sure to let him know who it\u2019s from.\u201d\n\u201cUh, wait!\u201d Cornelia rapidly shook her head. \u201cI-I got that glass for you, so I think you should\u2014you know what? Never mind! Maybe I should just take that\u2014oh no!\u201d\nRishe ignored the ashen-faced Cornelia, raising the glass and swallowing down a gulp. \n\u201cI-I can\u2019t believe\u2026\u201d\n\u201cSuch a spicy flavor, just as I imagined.\u201d Rishe smiled again to the assembled group\u2019s astonishment. \u201cWhat a warm welcome. I do hope the two of us can spend more time together. Perhaps\u2026a tea party?\u201d\n\u201cTh-the two of us?\u201d Cornelia stammered.\n\u201cYes. I want to know all about House Toona.\u201d\nCornelia looked flabbergasted, but she recovered herself and nodded.\nThat should do. One of Rishe\u2019s eventual plans required a plot of land in a temperate climate. House Toona\u2019s would likely be perfect, but she needed to confirm a few things with Cornelia. Never back down from a fight. Even further\u2026\nShe recalled the words of her mentor from her days as a merchant.\nDon\u2019t bother with fights you can\u2019t win.\nThe other ladies fled, fearful of this strange girl who gulped down painfully spicy wine like it was nothing. \n \n***\n \nRishe retreated to the empty balcony to enjoy the music, grimacing with every stinging mouthful of wine. She drank it in decreasing sips until Arnold joined her.\n\u201cWhat are you making that face for?\u201d\nRishe swirled the glass. \u201cDon\u2019t worry, it\u2019s not you. It\u2019s just this wine is so spicy.\u201d\n\u201cSpicy? The wine is?\u201d\n\u201cMm. It\u2019s seasoned with capsicum. I barely managed to get that first mouthful down without gagging.\u201d\nArnold swiped the glass from her hand. \u201cDon\u2019t tell me this was a poisoning attempt!\u201d\nRishe clicked her tongue in annoyance at her own lack of vigilance. No one else would be able to grab something from her so easily.\nArnold glared at the wine. \u201cYou don\u2019t need to drink this. I\u2019ll get rid of it.\u201d\n\u201cHey, give that back! They ruined a perfectly good glass of wine because of me. I\u2019m not going to waste it.\u201d She grabbed it back and took another sip, shuddering at the taste.\nArnold glowered. \u201cTell me who did this. I\u2019ll have them executed.\u201d\n\u201cDon\u2019t be ridiculous. You don\u2019t kill people like her\u2014you use them.\u201d Just the tiniest bit of wine to go, but it was getting harder to make herself drink it. She gave the glass a reproachful look, then glanced back at Arnold. \u201cOh, and I owe you an apology.\u201d\n\u201cDo you?\u201d\n\u201cI used your name to defend myself.\u201d The girls had only backed off when she threatened to tattle to Arnold. Rishe found that sort of thing inelegant in the extreme, and she was embarrassed.\nArnold sighed at Rishe\u2019s apologetic bow. \u201cThere\u2019s nothing wrong with a wife invoking her husband\u2019s name.\u201d\nRishe hesitated. \u201cWe\u2019re not married yet.\u201d\n\u201cThat\u2019s a formality. It\u2019s as good as done, if you ask me.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2026see.\u201d\nHe took her distraction as an opportunity to swipe her glass back. Instead of dumping it out, Arnold gulped the rest of it down. \n\u201cDamn, that packs a punch,\u201d he grumbled.\n\u201cI told you that!\u201d Rishe snapped. \u201cAre you all right? Let me get you some water!\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m fine. But now you\u2019ve fulfilled your obligation to the wine, haven\u2019t you?\u201d\nRishe didn\u2019t know what to say. He\u2019d helped her\u2014not by taking charge but by following her lead. Without cutting her down and telling her she was being foolish. Without rolling his eyes and dismissing her desires as trifles.\n\u201cThank you,\u201d Rishe said stiffly, which just made him laugh.\n\u201cWhat were you thinking about when we were dancing?\u201d he asked.\n\u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d\n\u201cYou were thinking about someone else, weren\u2019t you? Who?\u201d\nRishe didn\u2019t know a delicate way to say I was thinking about a future version of you I met in another life.\n\u201cHmm?\u201d His tone was oddly light, teasing even. But the gleam in his hunter\u2019s eyes said she wouldn\u2019t get away so easily.\nObviously, Rishe couldn\u2019t give him an honest answer. \u201cI wasn\u2019t thinking about anyone else. I was worried about you.\u201d\n\u201cWhy?\u201d\nThis was the closest she could come to the truth. \u201cWere you injured here?\u201d She patted",
    "query_text": " her own left shoulder with her forefinger. \nArnold went silent. His left shoulder was slightly slower to react than his right\u2014if his right was at one hundred, then his left was at maybe ninety-eight. It was hardly noticeable, but Rishe had picked up on it. He was right-handed, and she wouldn\u2019t have noticed it if"

    "prefix_text": " her face was as blank as a rock wall.\nI\u2019m sorry for the deception. I figured blending in would give me the best picture of your working conditions.\nThe new maids wore similarly shocked expressions, while others watched her with delight. Meanwhile, the veterans, including Diana, had all gone pale. They trembled, stunned into silence. One seemed locked in a terrifying trance, while another looked on the verge of tears. All of them had spoken to Rishe with derision. As the ringleader, Diana was covering her mouth with both hands, like she was holding in a scream.\nOliver had finished his introduction. \u201cYour Highness, if you would?\u201d\nRishe stepped forward. \u201cFirst, I must apologize to you for what has transpired prior to this meeting. My deception, that is. However, it has granted me insight into how each one of you works.\u201d\nOliver\u2019s face creased in confusion. The newcomer maids began to panic, whispering among themselves.\n\u201cDoesn\u2019t this mean that she helped us out with the laundry?\u201d\n\u201cWe\u2019re going to be fired!\u201d\n\u201cIf I lose my position, my brother will have to quit school!\u201d\nNoticing the commotion, Oliver glanced at Rishe. \u201cYour Highness, two-thirds of these maids are newly recruited from the city. Since the majority of the castle maids were elderly, His Highness assumed you would prefer maids closer in age to yourself.\u201d\nRishe was startled. She had found it odd that most of her potential servants were new hires, but she hadn\u2019t expected this to be the reason.\n\u201cWhile the prince has entrusted the selection of your maids to you,\u201d Oliver went on. \u201cHiring someone with no experience will not do. Despite Prince Arnold\u2019s views, I urge you to reject the newcomers.\u201d\n\u201cOliver.\u201d\n\u201cI have a list of their names here. Elsie\u2014\u201d\n\u201cElsie, Nichole, Hilde, Marguerite, Rosa.\u201d Rishe began listing the names of the newly recruited maids. She\u2019d made a point to memorize them in the washhouse. \u201cElke, Amelia, and\u2014\u201d\nOliver looked at her wildly. \u201cYou know them all?! Even though they\u2019ve never served you in the past?\u201d\n\u201cYes, of course I do. Servants are essential to the maintenance of our lifestyle, why wouldn\u2019t I get to know them?\u201d Rishe listed the remaining names for good measure. \u201cAll twenty of you, listen to me.\u201d \nThe new maids stiffened. Diana and the other maids whose names hadn\u2019t been called were getting their wind back, wearing increasingly triumphant looks.\nRishe said, \u201cThe twenty names I just called will be my maids.\u201d\nTime seemed to stand still a moment, and then Oliver broke in with an astonished, \u201cB-but, my lady! They are all inexperienced\u2014\u201d\n\u201cYes. And my palace will be the perfect place to learn.\u201d\nThe new recruits were completely speechless, unsure of exactly what was happening. \nRishe smiled at Elsie. \u201cI hope you\u2019ll serve me well, Elsie.\u201d\nElsie was still frozen in place. \u201cHuh? Y-yes, my lady, but\u2014\u201d\nA shaking Diana cried out, \u201cBut why, my lady?! You\u2019ve seen their work! They\u2019re useless, the lot of them! The rest of us get so much more done in a shorter amount of time!\u201d\n\u201cWatch your tongue, girl,\u201d Oliver said sharply.\nDiana ignored him. \u201cWe\u2019re hard workers! Any job you assign us, we can do it! Please, I beg you, my lady!\u201d\n\u201cStep back,\u201d Oliver warned. \u201cDo not take a single step closer to Lady Rishe.\u201d\nDiana spoke in a rush, words pouring out of her. \u201cI-I freely admit that I was impolite before, but I didn\u2019t know who she was! I\u2019ll take any punishment, so please, give me the chance to show you how well I can work!\u201d\nRishe said, \u201cDiana, I have a request.\u201d\n\u201cTh-thank you, my lady!\u201d Diana heaved a sigh of relief. \u201cYou mean you\u2019ll\u2014\u201d \nRishe cut across her. \u201cAs of today, you are no longer a maid in this palace.\u201d \n\u201cWhat?\u201d Her face, usually so fixed with determination, paled. \u201cBut why? I\u2019m so much better than any of them! I\u2019ll do a perfect job no matter what task you set before me. Please don\u2019t dismiss me, my lady!\u201d \n\u201cListen to me, Diana.\u201d Rishe dropped her lofty tone, speaking as one woman would to another. \u201cYou have noticed it, haven\u2019t you? No matter what you claim, these new girls aren\u2019t worthless.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2026I don\u2019t understand.\u201d\n\u201cCan you remember your first month in service? How difficult it was?\u201d\nDiana looked completely bewildered. Her gaze darted around as if looking for help.\nPulling herself together, she forced herself to follow Rishe\u2019s directions. She thought back and finally alighted on a response. \u201cI\u2026I didn\u2019t know how to do the job. Before, when my family was still prominent, I\u2019d washed shirts and bedsheets. Never gowns or military uniforms.\u201d\n\u201cPerfectly reasonable,\u201d Rishe said. \u201cOnly natural for someone just starting out.\u201d\n\u201cThe older girls were so busy, they told me to just watch them since they didn\u2019t have time to teach me. When I had questions\u2026well, there was nobody to ask.\u201d\n\u201cI bet. And did you have any other problems?\u201d\n\u201cWell, yes. There was a lot to learn. Different kinds of soap and washboards depending on the cloth. You use different tools for different materials. I had to learn how they worked and how to put them away. I was\u2026punished if I didn\u2019t get it right the first time.\u201d\nThe newcomers were exchanging surprised looks. Rishe understood why.\nEverything Diana said was familiar to them. They spent valuable time searching for their materials and the proper ways to use them, but they shrank from asking for help. Everyone always looked so busy. This was a universal problem.\n\u201cDespite all that, I got better!\u201d Diana protested. \u201cI only needed to be taught once. Unlike them! They\u2019re useless!\u201d\n\u201cYes, well. There\u2019s a difference between you and them,\u201d Rishe told Diana. \u201cYou can read and write.\u201d\n\u201cOh!\u201d Diana started in surprise. Elsie looked at the floor.\nThe literacy rate among commoners was low no matter where you went. Very few families had the means to afford an education, especially for daughters. Diana had been born to a merchant\u2019s family\u2014she\u2019d received formal schooling. The maids she was close friends with were likely from similar backgrounds. The majority of those in service were not so fortunate.\n\u201cWhat if you only received instructions on how to do a job once and weren\u2019t able to write it down to remind yourself later?\u201d Rishe asked. \u201cWould you be so confident?\u201d\n\u201cI-I don\u2019t\u2014\u201d Diana reflexively thrust a hand into her apron pocket, where she had a list of daily tasks recorded in her neat handwriting to reference throughout the day. Hopefully now she would understand how much of an edge her privileged literacy gave her over the other maids.\n\u201cEveryone else works as hard as they can, just like you do,\u201d Rishe said. \u201cRemember how it was for you at first? They all have to start somewhere. I hope you\u2019ll keep that in mind.\u201d\n\u201cThey\u2019re no different from me,\u201d Diana mumbled begrudgingly, glancing around the room, looking at the less experienced maids. As if coming to a decision, she said, \u201cI\u2019m sorry.\u201d\n\u201cDiana?\u201d\nLike a child enumerating her regrets, Diana went on, \u201cI\u2019ve done you wrong, all of you. It\u2019s just, I had nothing. Or so it felt like. No money, no title. I thought I had to make my way in the world on my own. That I had to start from zero.\u201d Her shoulders trembled as she buried her face in her hands. \u201cBut I was wrong! I wasn\u2019t starting from zero. I had everything that I learned growing up. I didn\u2019t realize how fortunate I was. I let it all go to my he\n \n\u201cRISHE IRMGARD WEITZNER! You are a vile woman! A truly malicious creature unworthy of the crown prince! As of this instant, our engagement is off!\u201d \n\u201cAs you wish, Your Highness.\u201d\n\u201c\u2026Huh?\u201d\nThe prince\u2019s declaration echoed throughout the ballroom. Rishe, the duke\u2019s daughter, bowed in response, her coral-toned hair swaying gracefully. The assembled guests found themselves captivated by her dignified beauty. Despite having just witnessed a broken engagement, they couldn\u2019t bring themselves to pity her.\nSlowly, Rishe lifted her head and fixed the prince with a pale-emerald gaze. It caught him off guard, but he quickly recovered.\n\u201cDidn\u2019t you hear what I just said?! I\u2019m calling off our engagement! Doesn\u2019t that trouble you?\u201d\n\u201cNot really.\u201d\nRishe already knew what happened next: false accusations, exile, and her family severing all ties and leaving her to survive on her own. She turned from the prince. There was no point wasting any time.\nThis is my seventh loop, after all.\nRishe had done this all before.\nThe next few hours will be busy. I must hurry and retrieve my things before I\u2019m barred from the family estate. I don\u2019t want this to be one of the times I\u2019m too slow and I have to start my new life with nothing.\n\u201cRishe, halt and hear me! I have spent the past week perfecting my recitation of your crimes!\u201d\nI should take more than dresses this time\u2014there\u2019s plenty of things I could use out in the world. What trade should I take up? In my first life, I was a merchant. In my second, an apothecary. I\u2019ve got a few more I want to try out\u2026 Augh! If time\u2019s just going to keep resetting, I wish I could start at an earlier point. I need more time to prepare!\n\u201cWait! Rishe!\u201d\nThe crown prince was on the verge of tears, and the spectators struggled to suppress their snickers. \nA thought occurred to Rishe, and she stopped. She then turned, her eyes gleaming beneath long lashes as she stared down her ex-fianc\u00e9. \u201cAh, Your Highness, I almost forgot.\u201d \n\u201cYes, tell me!\u201d the prince fumed. \u201cLet me guess, you are hurt beyond measure and yet love me still\u2026correct?\u201d\nAs if. Rishe was grateful to be granted her freedom. In fact, she was smiling as she said, \u201cI hope you and Lady Mary are happy together.\u201d\n\u201cWhat?!\u201d\n\u201cMay we both lead fulfilling lives. Farewell!\u201d Rishe lifted the skirts of her evening gown and turned on her heel, departing as briskly as she could.\n\u201cHow do you know about Mary? I haven\u2019t told you I love her!\u201d The prince was shouting something behind her, but she paid him no mind. She had things to do.\nDuring her first loop, the prince\u2019s accusations had shocked her to the core and she\u2014foolishly so\u2014had attempted to defend herself. Now she knew better than to expect the prince to behave reasonably. \nHow will life unfold this time? I\u2019m excited to find out! Rishe fixed her mind on the future.\nThis is my seventh \u201cdo-over.\u201d I\u2019ve led happy and carefree lives before, but this time\u2014this time, I swear I\u2019ll live a long happy and carefree life!\nIn other words, she needed to avoid getting killed. At any cost. \n \n***\n \nIn the first loop, with her engagement broken and her reputation in tatters, Rishe roamed with nothing but the clothes on jewelry. Finding them a good-natured band, she hitched a ride to a neighboring country.\nFrom the merchant caravan, she learned a trade, studying how to procure stock and balance ledgers. Eventually, she set out on her own to travel the world. Her upbringing as a daughter of the nobility meant that, even at fifteen years old, Rishe possessed a keen sense for beauty.\nShe collected things that caught her eye and sold them to whoever found delight in her wares. Before she realized it, she had become a major vendor, employing a full staff. She had even done business with the king of a desert nation and the prince of a frozen country up north. She traveled to many distant places, realizing a dream born from her cossetted former life spent doing nothing but preparing to be queen.\nFive years passed, and just as she had only one country left to visit, Rishe fell victim to the war",
    "query_text": " sweeping across the continent.\nThe next thing she knew, she was fifteen years old again and back at that party, with the prince poised to make his pronouncement.\n\u201cRishe Irmgard Weitzner! You are a vile woman! A truly malicious creature unworthy of the crown prince! As of this instant, our engagement is off!\u201d\nNaturally, she didn\u2019t understand what was going on at first. She looked around. Everything was the same. She stood in the same place wearing the same dress and draped in the same jewelry she\u2019d sold to the caravan.\nWas it a dream? Or was everything that had happened up until then the dream? In her confusion, all she could do was stare.\nRishe hurried out of the ballroom, the impending threat of exile hanging over her and the prince\u2019s entreaties to halt ringing in her ears"

Her appearance was that of any young noblewoman, but she moved like a well-trained knight. She\u2019d leapt from the balcony and landed skillfully, showing no signs of distress at her ripped dress or disheveled hair. Instead, she\u2019d knocked the heels off her shoes and dashed away.\nAlso, she had called him an emperor.\nPlaying it all over again in his head, Arnold broke out into a rare chuckle. As his shoulders quivered with laughter, his attendant approached him from behind.\n\u201cThere you are, Your Highness. What are you doing out here? I\u2019m aware you don\u2019t desire a wife, but beginning the search would be wise\u2026 Er, Your Highness?\u201d The attendant\u2019s eyes flew wide. His bored and scowling master was laughing. \u201cDid something happen?\u201d\n\u201cOliver, ready my coach. Wait, no. That will take too much time. Bring me a horse.\u201d\n\u201cAt once, Your Highness. Might I ask why?\u201d\nArnold didn\u2019t respond\u2014he just grinned like a hungry wolf catching scent of his prey.\n \n***\n \nOnce outside the palace gates, Rishe threw herself into the waiting coach, shouting for the driver to make haste. She stopped it a few hundred yards from the manor and bid him farewell. \u201cI\u2019m leaving! Thanks for always being such a safe driver, Daniel!\u201d\nThe road to the manor was muddy from a morning rain shower. She knew from her second life that the coach would get stuck, resulting in a loss of valuable time. It was better to just get out and run. \n\u201cHuff, huff.\u201d Despite her last life\u2019s physical conditioning, this body had no stamina. She\u2019d need to try to get fitter faster this time around.\nRishe reached the end of the road, and her heart promptly sank all the way to her feet. \u201cOh no.\u201d\nThe front door was thronged with people, all of them surrounding a carriage bearing the royal family\u2019s coat of arms.\nI need to get out of here.\nWhile she stood frozen in indecision, one of the knights doing crowd control shouted, \u201cYour Highness! I have eyes on Lady Rishe!\u201d\n\u201cGet out of my way!\u201d A familiar voice started up a bellow. \u201cLet me through! Rishe, how dare you make me wait so long?\u201d\nRishe\u2019s ex-fianc\u00e9, Crown Prince Dietrich, stepped triumphantly forward.\n\u201cI know the thought of hearing your crimes enumerated by the man you love must pain you, but alas, as future king, it is my duty to bring down the hammer of justice upon a villainess such as yourself!\u201d\n\u201cI see I\u2019ve timed it badly,\u201d Rishe muttered. \u201cIn fact, this is my worst loop yet. I\u2019d rather be barred from the house than see you again.\u201d\n\u201cHmm? What are you grumbling about?\u201d Dietrich looked Rishe up and down. \u201cI knew it. You put on a brave face, but I can sense the sorrow in your heart.\u201d\n\u201cI beg your pardon?\u201d\n\u201cYour heart!\u201d the prince repeated. \u201cYour heart! It must be absolutely crushed! Because I called off our engagement!\u201d\nRishe wasn\u2019t sure where he was drawing these conclusions from. Possibly the same place he mined for all his bottomless self-confidence.\n\u201cI can tell you\u2019ve been wandering aimlessly, distraught,\u201d the prince went on. \u201cLook at you. Your dress is caked in mud, your shoes are broken, and there are cuts marring your face and arms. What other possible cause could there be than heartbreak?\u201d\nRishe narrowed her eyes. \u201cDo you ever stop to think about the words coming out of your mouth?\u201d\n\u201cWhat?\u201d\nHis interpretation of events was fanciful to the point of absurdity. \u201cI did not dirty my dress or snap my shoes out of heartbreak. Because I feel none. You\u2019ve always been a little slow, so I\u2019ll make this clear: I do not have a single shred of fondness for you, or for our broken engagement.\u201d\n\u201cWhat?!\u201d the prince said. \u201cWhat are you saying?!\u201d\nThe surrounding crowd began to snicker.\n\u201cIsn\u2019t that the crown prince? Did Lady Rishe just dump him?\u201d\n\u201cWait, but wasn\u2019t he trying to dump her?\u201d\n\u201cCan\u2019t be! Look at her! She doesn\u2019t care at all!\u201d\n\u201cHow dare you nobodies make sport of me?\u201d Dietrich screeched. \u201cI am your prince!\u201d\nTemper aside, Dietrich was a handsome man. He had azure-blue eyes and blond hair\u2014a prince straight out of a picture book. His looks and place in the succession meant a never-ending swarm of women vying for his affections. He was brought up a pampered princeling, never wanting for anything. It manifested in a pompous manner and an overconfidence in his own abilities. Rishe had cautioned him about his attitude before, but he never paid her any mind.\nI\u2019m so glad I don\u2019t have to marry him.\nShe wished she could go back and tell the shocked, scared girl from her first life not to worry about her shattered engagement. Still, she might as well say it all here and now, with the assembled knights and citizens to bear witness.\n\u201cYour Highness, you exist to love and protect your people. It\u2019s unbecoming to speak of them in this manner.\u201d\n\u201cYou\u2019re the unbecoming one!\u201d the prince snapped. \u201cBeg me for forgiveness!\u201d\n\u201cI won\u2019t. Calling off our betrothal is the best course, and I applaud Your Highness for your good sense.\u201d\nNow even the knights were trembling with suppressed mirth. \nDietrich was turning red. \u201cD-don\u2019t laugh at me!\u201d\n\u201cLady Rishe,\u201d came a sweet voice. \u201cAren\u2019t you ashamed of yourself?\u201d \nRishe fought down a groan.\nOut of the crowd stepped a charming, dainty girl. Her big eyes moist with tears, she took her place at Dietrich\u2019s side. \u201cI do not allow the people I care about to be treated so very ill!\u201d \n\u201cWhy, Lady Mary. You\u2019re here.\u201d Rishe sighed. \u201cHow nice.\u201d\nThe young Mary scowled through her tears. Hidden behind her skirts, Dietrich continued to shout his disapproval. \u201cRishe! You\u2019ve brought my beloved Mary to tears! She\u2019s told me everything. How you bullied her, ridiculed her. How you find it amusing to lock her in the classroom overnight! Such a wicked woman could never be queen!\u201d\nNone of that\u2019s true.\nRishe glanced at Mary, who averted her gaze a little awkwardly.\n\u201cMore importantly,\u201d Rishe said, \u201chave you already brought your concerns to my parents, Your Highness?\u201d\n\u201cMore importantly?! I did, if you must know! Your parents are furious. They have vowed to disown you.\u201d\n\u201cAh. Then I\u2019m too late.\u201d Her parents held their reputation above all else. Rishe had little hope of retrieving any of her money or belongings now.\n\u201cWhy are you acting so strangely?\u201d Dietrich sniffed. \u201cAh, I understand. You\u2019re in such shock from this turn of events that\u2014\u201d\n\u201cListen, Dietrich.\u201d In her exasperation, Rishe dropped his title. \u201cI accept your decree. We are no longer engaged. I shall never darken your doorstep again. So\u2026relax a little.\u201d\n\u201cHuh? What are you saying?\u201d\n\u201cSince I was a child, I believed that my only value was in our betrothal. Being engaged to the crown prince was my whole reason for living. I was wrong about that. Only I determine my value\u2014no one else. That\u2019s why I don\u2019t care about this. I\u2019m beyond it.\u201d Rishe made sure to look him directly in the eye as she spoke. \u201cYou are an unnecessary element in my life.\u201d\nDietrich staggered back. His legs seemed to go out from under him, and he crumpled. At that, the knights finally let go of their composure, laughing along with the courtiers.\n\u201cSt-stop!\u201d the prince wailed. \u201cYou are my subjects. This\u2026this shows such flagrant disrespect!\u201d\n\u201cDietrich, don\u2019t pay them any mind,\u201d Lady Mary said. \u201cLady Rishe, is this cruelty necessary?\u201d\n\u201cPerhaps this is a blessing in disguise.\u201d Rishe\u2019s attention moved to Mary, making the girl\u2019s slender shoulders jump. She had no reason to worry; Rishe didn\u2019t bite. \u201cI\u2019ve been wanting the opportunity to speak to you, Lady Mary. You\u2019re strong. I admire you very much.\u201d\n\u201cWhat are you talking about?\u201d\n\u201cYou\u2019re a lovely girl who never fails to smile despite your troubles. You don\u2019t put up walls around your heart, and you do your utmost to put others at ease. Even now, you bravely stand before me to protect the prince.\u201d\nMary\u2019s eyes were wide with confusion. Rishe picked her words carefully, attempting to diminish the girl\u2019s guilty feelings, if only a little. \u201cYou need to marry the prince for your family\u2019s sake, right?\u201d\n\u201cHow do you\u2014?\u201d\nRishe had learned this truth in one of her past lives. Mary was born to a poor family, and she had studied like mad to be accepted into the academy to hunt for a husband. She intended to make sure neither she nor her brothers ever went hungry again.\nShe went on, \u201cRemember this: you are the one in control of your life. Don\u2019t sell it to anyone else. Can you trust a man who so easily discards the woman he\u2019s been engaged to since childhood? Do you truly believe he cares for you?\u201d\nAstonishment bloomed across Mary\u2019s face. She looked over at Dietrich, who hadn\u2019t bothered to stand up. The truth was\u2026within a year, Prince Dietrich would be in prison, his title stripped from him. He would plan a mad coup d\u2019\u00e9tat against the king, attempting to provoke the citizens to war. His plan would be discovered in its early stages, rendering him a laughingstock across the kingdom.\n\u201cYou must shape your future with your own hands\u2014you mustn\u2019t entrust your desires to others.\u201d \n\u201cMy\u2026my desires?\nRishe nodded.\nMary was looking at her like she was speaking a foreign language. \u201cBut I\u2019m their elder sister.\u201d Her voice quivered. \u201cI must endure, no matter what. Otherwise, my brothers will never be happy.\u201d\n\u201cAnd you believe their happiness can only be achieved by sacrificing your own?\u201d\nMary gasped as she gaped at Rishe.\n\u201cYou don\u2019t need to throw away your own future to protect those you love,\u201d Rishe told her. \u201cNo matter what path you choose, never forget that.\u201d\n\u201cMy future?\u201d Mary\u2019s voice went ragged, like she was barely suppressing a wail of pain.\n\u201cI wish you a life where both you and your family can be happy,\u201d said Rishe.\nMary stood frozen in place, eyes gleaming like precious stones. Rishe couldn\u2019t help but admire how pretty she was. She truly did wish her happiness. But right now, she needed to take care of herself. \n\u201cWell.\u201d Rishe suddenly broke into a smile, making Dietrich flinch. \u201cI think it\u2019s time for me to be on my way.\u201d\nShe regretted losing access to her room, but she knew her parents wouldn\u2019t let her in. Turning her back on the crowd, Rishe contemplated her next move.\n\u201cWait, Lady Rishe!\u201d Mary\u2019s voice rang out.\n\u201cThat\u2019s right. You\u2019re not going anywhere, Rishe!\u201d The prince joined her. \u201cYou won\u2019t get away with treating me like trash to relieve your own injured heart.\u201d\n\u201cUgh, enough already!\u201d Rishe\u2019s patience was fraying. \u201cI don\u2019t have anything else to say to you. Goodbye!\u201d\n\u201cKnights, stop her!\u201d\nReluctantly, the knights moved to tail Rishe as she walked briskly back down the path. She sympathized with them, but she wasn\u2019t about to let them keep her here. Rounding a corner, she sensed something uncanny. She stopped, the knights quickly catching up with her.\n\u201cMy apologies, Lady Rishe. If you could please remain for just a\u2014whoa!\u201d\nRishe grabbed the hilt of the knight\u2019s sword. Yanking it from his belt, she spun around and stood at the ready. Metal rang against metal as Rishe parried a blow. She glared at her would-be attacker as he stepped out of the shadows.\nArnold Hein!\n\u201cWell, what do you know.\u201d The man smiling so sweetly while their swords locked was the very man who had ended her life. \u201cYou do have some skill.\u201d\nMetal screeched and slid, before Arnold sheathed his sword. Rishe lowered hers. Neither looked away.\n\u201cWho the hell are you?\u201d demanded one of the knights.\n\u201cStand down, good sirs,\u201d Rishe said. \u201cYour interference will only make this worse.\u201d\nThis mostly served to befuddle the knights further. Rishe absolutely couldn\u2019t allow them to come to blows with the crown prince of a friendly nation. And they couldn\u2019t beat him\u2014not even if they took him all at once. Rishe had blocked his blow, but her arm was completely numb. To think he\u2019d be even more powerful in five years.\nHe regarded her unabashedly. \u201cRishe, was that your name? Where did you learn such swordsmanship?\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m afraid I cannot say. Besides, you were clearly going easy on me.\u201d\n\u201cHa! You could tell?\u201d\nArnold\u2019s manner was throwing her off. He seemed to be enjoying himself. He\u2019s laughing. This monstrous prince is\u2026actually laughing.\nWhen she had met him in her other life, he was cold and merciless, like a genuine monster. And yet here he stood, mellow and smiling.\nThe Emperor Arnold Hein I knew was twenty-four years old, so he\u2019s, what? Nineteen now? This is so weird. He\u2019s grinning like a boy getting into a scrape.\nThat attack had been good-natured as well, almost playful. It had muscle behind it but certainly not any lethal intent. He\u2019d just wanted to force Rishe to catch the blow. She found it unbelievable that he could exude such an overpowering air of menace when he was just messing around.\nWhile Rishe was focused on Arnold, Mary and Dietrich caught up, seemingly recovered.\n\u201cExcuse me, my lord!\u201d Mary squeaked. \u201cI-I-I don\u2019t know who you are, but kindly step away from Lady Rishe!\u201d\n\u201cYes, do as she says! Who the hell are you, anyway?!\u201d\nDon\u2019t tell me Prince Dietrich doesn\u2019t recognize one of his personal guests.\nDietrich\u2019s interests did not lean toward diplomacy; he likely hadn\u2019t bothered to introduce himself to Arnold. Mary, for her part, seemed to grasp that Arnold wasn\u2019t ordinary. She stood up to defend Rishe, despite the tremble in her voice. In a better world, perhaps the two of them could have become friends.\n\u201cThat\u2019s your ex-fianc\u00e9?\u201d Arnold cocked a brow. \u201cHe\u2019s even worse than I imagined. Pathetic.\u201d\nDietrich flushed. \u201cI\u2019ll have your head!\u201d\n\u201cDietrich, I beg of you, contain yourself,\u201d Rishe said, then rounded on Arnold. \u201cAs for you, Your Highness\u2014you know who Dietrich is, and you know what speaking carelessly could mean. Are you trying to pick a fight?\u201d\n\u201cWhatever do you mean?\u201d Arnold\u2019s brows lifted high, making him the picture of innocence. \u201cBelieve me, Lady Rishe, every word I speak is chosen with extreme care.\u201d\nFinally realizing who Arnold was, Dietrich visibly paled. \u201cArnold? He\u2019s the crown prince of Galkhein?\u201d\nMary yelped. The knights stood down, shamefaced. The gossip-hungry neighbors who\u2019d gathered to witness a scandal play out drew back in fear.\n\u201cHe\u2019s the demon prince? The one who single-handedly destroyed a whole order of enemy knights?\u201d\n\u201cWatch your tongue, fool! Do you want him to do the same to you?\u201d\nThe two nations enjoyed peaceful relations, but Arnold remained the dreaded prince, heir to the throne of a former enemy. Current rumor wasn\u2019t as widespread as it would be in five years, but he was still regarded with distrust.\nThe onlookers stood rooted to the spot, too terrified to flee.\nWell, this has devolved into a full-fledged disaster.\nRishe heaved a frustrated sigh. \u201cPrince Arnold, to what do we owe this honor? Surely a crown prince would not draw his sword for a mere jest.\u201d\n",
    "query_text": "\u201cI\u2019m here on business,\u201d Arnold said. \u201cBut first, I must beg forgiveness for my rudeness.\u201d\nHuh, what do you know? Once he became emperor, he\u2019d gladly behead any subject who so much as dared speak a word against him.\nI guess at nineteen he still knew how to apologize.\nIf that surprised her, Arnold\u2019s next act completely obliterated her sense of reality. \nWith a flourish, he fell to his knees. \n\u201cHuh?\u201d Is this actually happening?"

I\u2019ll simply move on to Plan B.\u201d\nAnd that was how she found herself in one of the palace\u2019s parlors, here to \u201cjust talk\u201d to Prince Arnold. The ball guests were all gone. It was just the two of them.\n\u201cI want to know what you\u2019re planning,\u201d Rishe said flatly.\n\u201cPlanning? Me?\u201d\n\u201cBy asking me to marry you. You don\u2019t know me. A proposal like this wouldn\u2019t come out of the blue.\u201d\nThis man was destined to become an aggressive warmonger over the next few years. He wouldn\u2019t do anything without a dozen motives.\nPrince Arnold just smiled. \u201cI have no plans. I\u2019m simply enamored with you.\u201d\n\u201cEnamored\u2026?\u201d\nThat was the last thing she\u2019d expected him to say. Asking him to elaborate didn\u2019t seem worth the breath\u2014he was obviously lying. As if this ruthless, inhuman creature with ice in his veins could feel even a flicker of affection.\n\u201cWhy refuse me?\u201d Arnold asked. \u201cYour engagement is broken, you\u2019re on the verge of exile, and you have no faction or supporters. At this rate, you\u2019ll be dead within a fortnight. I\u2019d call my offer a stroke of unbelievable fortune.\u201d\n\u201cYou\u2019re not wrong,\u201d Rishe admitted. \u201cOnce upon a time, I would have jumped at your offer.\u201d\nIf it had been made in her first life, for instance. But now Rishe knew better. Her life was only just getting started, and the future held endless possibilities. After the horror of her sixth loop, she yearned for freedom.\nI don\u2019t want to marry him. I won\u2019t be anyone\u2019s captive. Still\u2026\nRishe, more than anyone, knew that the slightest adjustment could enact profound changes on the trajectory of a life. No doubt she\u2019d have many more lives, but this could be the only one where marriage to Arnold would be an option.\nThe dread emperor. The tyrant. The man who will stoke the fires of war. \nRishe knew the gossip, the endless conjecture behind Arnold Hein\u2019s bloody reign, but she didn\u2019t know the truth.\nWhy? The question had haunted her since her first life. She\u2019d never before had the chance to even speak to him.\nShe had wondered it as a merchant, hearing of the distant outbreak of war. She\u2019d wondered when the news of the dead and dying reached her apothecary. When she had comforted her terrified mistress in her life as a maid, assuring her everything would be all right. When she squared off against him in battle, as he plunged a sword through her heart\u2014even then she wondered. \nIf I stick around, maybe I\u2019ll finally have my answer. Half of her was dying to know. The other half didn\u2019t give a damn. And yet\u2026\nShe recalled a childhood dream. Rather, a longing.\nRishe let out a breath. \u201cYou claim you are enamored with me.\u201d\n\u201cYes. I am completely under your spell.\u201d\nTo think he could spout such nonsense with a straight face!\n\u201cThen will you grant me anything I desire?\u201d\n\u201cSo long as it is within my power,\u201d Arnold said. \u201cAnything you want will be yours.\u201d\nRishe hesitated, gathering her thoughts. \u201cI have some conditions.\u201d Arnold silently motioned for her to go on. \u201cI want full control over the wedding festivities. Everything must be procured through merchants of my choosing.\u201d\n\u201cFine.\u201d Arnold nodded. \u201cYou\u2019re free to do business with whomever you wish.\u201d\n\u201cAfter we are married, I must be in a position to mingle with guests from abroad.\u201d\n\u201cThat sounds within the purview of the crown princess. Anything else?\u201d\n\u201cI will be allowed to live in a separate residence from your mother and father.\u201d\nShe meant this seriously, but it made Arnold laugh. \u201cYou don\u2019t seem the type to worry about an overbearing mother-in-law.\u201d\n\u201cYou would be surprised. Combative relationships with one\u2019s new family are the most difficult part of marriage, or so they say. It could be a ramshackle cottage for all I care\u2014I just require a secondary residence.\u201d\nActually, Rishe didn\u2019t care at all about in-laws. When Arnold set his war into motion, his first move would be the assassination of his father. A genuine coup by patricide, not at all like Dietrich\u2019s clumsy attempt. Next, he would name himself emperor, take control of the country, and mobilize the military.\nSeparating him from his parents will make the first step more difficult\u2014although not impossible, unfortunately.\n\u201cAnything else?\u201d Arnold asked. \u201cI\u2019ll do whatever it takes to marry you.\u201d\n\u201cIdeally, I\u2019d like to know your endgame,\u201d Rishe said with dignity. \u201cBut as I doubt there\u2019s any chance of that, I have one final request.\u201d She jabbed a finger into his face, regardless of how rude it was. \u201cI will spend my time idling around the castle. No work, no study. I shall be utterly useless.\u201d\nLet\u2019s see just how much you want me as your princess.\nAfter a long moment of silence, Arnold cracked a merry laugh. The proposal remained; all her conditions were met.\n\n(2) chapter number given is likely out of range: 0\nChapter: 7\n\nChapter 2\nChapter 2\n \n\u201cYOU KNOW, it was only after I went into commerce that I truly had a dream for the future,\u201d Rishe had once confided in a friend. \u201cUp until then, I existed only as the crown prince\u2019s fianc\u00e9e or my father\u2019s daughter. My every act was to become more worthy of that status. But now, for the first time, I actually have a goal of my own.\u201d\n\u201cOh, yeah?\u201d her friend said. He was the ruler of the desert kingdom, and his smile was awfully charming. \u201cWhat\u2019s that?\u201d\nRishe smiled back. \u201cI want to travel to every single country in the world. I want to see everything in every town, peruse their markets, and meet the eyes of every person who lives there!\u201d\nBy now, that felt like such a distant dream.\n \n***\n \nRishe awoke with a start, eyes snapping open as she sensed a disturbance in the air.\nShe unsheathed her sword halfway, primed for danger. \nInside the coach, her old enemy sat across from her, one hand outstretched. \u201cWhat do you think you\u2019re doing?\u201d she demanded.\nWhen they\u2019d boarded the coach, Rishe had warned him not to lay a single finger on her throughout the trip to his kingdom. Ordering the prince not to touch his consort was absurd, but Arnold readily agreed. He had, after all, promised to follow her every direction.\nAnd yet, here he was, already breaking his promise.\nArnold appeared unperturbed by her glare. \u201cDon\u2019t look at me like that. I was merely trying to recover what you took from me.\u201d\nConfused, Rishe looked at the sword in her hand. It had a black lacquered scabbard with a simple golden decoration. Engraved on the hilt was the Galkhein crest.\n\u201cOh!\u201d Rishe thrust the sword back at Arnold. \u201cMy apologies.\u201d\nArnold chuckled. \u201cYou caught me off guard. You were nodding off, and then you suddenly snatched up my sword. You looked quite content snuggling up with it.\u201d\nArnold propped the sword beside him. Rishe pressed a hand to her chest to quell her racing heart. The sword that gutted me in my previous life is now my bedmate. What a world. Her recent stint as a knight had left her ill at ease without a blade at hand. She just couldn\u2019t believe it was Arnold\u2019s she\u2019d reached for.\n\u201cI didn\u2019t mean to disturb you, but I doubted sleeping with a weapon would be comfortable. I\u2019m impressed you sensed my intent before I even touched you",
    "query_text": ".\u201d Arnold rested one elbow against the window frame, watching her with shameless fascination. \u201cOne only develops instincts like that from combat training. And you were also a member of the court? How in the world did you find the time?\u201d\nRishe shrugged. She couldn\u2019t just say, I pretended to be a man in a previous life, that\u2019s how.\n\u201cI assume there\u2019s more to you than your devotion to the sword. You seem to like flowers.\u201d\nShe followed Arnold\u2019s gaze to where she\u2019d bundled"

That would be unusual adornment for a crown prince\u2019s retinue, but it wouldn\u2019t hurt to ask.\nShe realized, quite suddenly, that Arnold was looking at her. At her hands, specifically. He sat cross-legged with his chin propped on his fist, staring absently, like a kid watching a column of ants march by.\nWhat is so fascinating about herbs?\nTheir eyes met. \u201cAm I bothering you?\u201d he asked.\nRishe shook her head slowly. \u201cNot at all. I was just curious what caught your eye.\u201d\n\u201cNothing specific. I was just thinking how very unusual you are.\u201d He was smiling again. \u201cI\u2019m looking forward to how you\u2019ll surprise me next.\u201d\nLike I\u2019m some sort of rare pet he bought to entertain him. She didn\u2019t like that. Nothing she\u2019d done was at all remarkable\u2014normal tasks performed by a normal person.\n\u201cI didn\u2019t make that antidote for your amusement.\u201d\n\u201cI realize that.\u201d The instigating smile faded from his lips. \u201cYou know, those knights you coerced into taking your home-brewed medicine were all born in the slums.\u201d\n\u201cCoerced? That\u2019s hardly the word I\u2019d use.\u201d\n\u201cGalkhein claims to value merit above all else, but in the end, people are judged by where they came from. Despite this, those men fought their way up from nothing.\u201d\nRishe paused in plucking the seeds from a flower and looked up at Arnold.\n\u201cThe men with the worst cases of the paralysis were all newly assigned. They\u2019ve spent weeks training to ensure this mission was a success. That older knight\u2014the one who bowed to you\u2014sustained an injury protecting the rookies. He cares deeply about his men.\u201d\n\u201cYou seem to care about them too,\u201d Rishe commented.\n\u201cI handpicked them for my retinue.\u201d Arnold clambered to his feet, only to fall into a bow. \u201cAnd you kept them safe. You have my deepest gratitude.\u201d\nRishe found herself at a loss for words. Was this Arnold putting on a mask to hide the monster within? Or was this the real him? She remembered the way he\u2019d looked when he held his blade to the bandit\u2019s throat, like a child poised to break a toy he had grown bored of.\n\u201cDon\u2019t mention it,\u201d Rishe said, uncomfortable. \u201cI knew how to do it, so I did.\u201d\nArnold laughed softly. \u201cBe that as it may, I\u2019d still count a noblewoman who can brew remedies from wildflowers by the side of the road a rare find.\u201d\n\u201cEarlier, when you grabbed my wrist\u2026\u201d Rishe steered the subject away from her incongruous knowledge. \u201cYou broke your promise. You said you wouldn\u2019t touch me.\u201d\n\u201cThat was reflex,\u201d Arnold protested. \u201cI thought you were going to hurt yourself.\u201d\nSuch a simple conversation, so casual. It had Rishe feeling positively peculiar.\n\u201cWhy are your knights so wary around me?\u201d she asked. \n\u201cWary? Oh, they were all at the palace when you broke your first engagement. They\u2019re most likely concerned I\u2019m bringing home a villainous jilt who will lead to my ruin. Something silly like that.\u201d\n\u201cI see.\u201d Apparently, being dumped by a prince called into question one\u2019s herbalist abilities.\n\u201cI\u2019m glad you mentioned it,\u201d Arnold went on, \u201cbecause there may be people in Galkhein who will oppose our union. I will do everything in my power to protect you, but you must bring any insults or threats to me right away.\u201d\n\u201cAre there likely to be many?\u201d\n\u201cIn theory, the crown prince may choose his own wife, but the done thing is, of course, to marry a princess. I assume a duke\u2019s daughter would have at least some ties to the royal family?\u201d\nHe assumed correctly. She was in the family tree, if a rather distant branch.\n\u201cMy father has ordered me to choose a bride from a different kingdom rather than a woman of my own land because\u2014\u201d\n\u201cOne never knows when a hostage will come in handy,\u201d Rishe finished for him.\nGalkhein was an expansionist empire. Currently, peace reigned\u2014but peace was precarious. If Galkhein demanded any of the countries to hand over a princess bride, then none were in a position to refuse. With his daughter in the hands of a foreign power, no king would dare oppose a war that power cared to wage.\n\u201cI sent a message to my father telling him I happened upon a close relation of Hermity\u2019s king\u2014a duke\u2019s daughter who had been recently tossed aside by her fianc\u00e9e,\u201d Arnold said. \u201cI also may have implied I was the reason for your falling out\u2014yours and the prince\u2019s. Why, when I saw a woman so powerful and connected and beloved, I couldn\u2019t help but plunder you.\u201d\n\u201cPlunder me? That\u2019s certainly one way to describe it.\u201d Dietrich had kicked up an almighty fuss, despite being the one who broke the engagement.\n\u201cMy father approves of you because he sees you as a bargaining chip. There will be others who aren\u2019t prepared to accept you so willingly.\u201d\n\u201cIs that so?\u201d Rishe said steadily.\n\u201cNever fear,\u201d Arnold responded. \u201cThey\u2019ll eat their words, every one of them. They will receive you as their crown princess if they value their\u2014\u201d\n\u201cNo, being a hostage is perfect.\u201d \nArnold stared at her. \u201cHm?\u201d\n\u201cAs a hostage, I\u2019ll have no official duties, will I? We can pretend I\u2019m here only under",
    "query_text": " great duress, and there will be no need for my comment on governmental or diplomatic affairs.\u201d\nArnold hesitated. \u201cI suppose not.\u201d\n\u201cExcellent! Then I can live my dream of being utterly useless.\u201d Rishe trembled with delight. The"

    "prefix_text": " There was Arnold, leaning against the door to the balcony. \u201cYou seem able to sense my approach no matter how far or how hard I try.\u201d\n\u201cYou\u2019re quite naughty, aren\u2019t you? You\u2019ve been making your presence known little by little, emanating threat, to see how quickly I catch on.\u201d\n\u201cSo you noticed that as well.\u201d Arnold joined Rishe on the balcony. She tensed, but all he did was cast a curious glance at the view. \u201cWhat were you looking at?\u201d\n\u201cThe city.\u201d Rishe was hardly going to tell him she\u2019d been looking at nothing, merely ruminating on her mother\u2019s overbearing advice. The view from the balcony was spectacular, though. \u201cWhat\u2019s that over there?\u201d\n\u201cYou mean the library? The state invested funds to expand it. We have books from all over the world.\u201d\n\u201cReally? You have a library that big?\u201d Rishe\u2019s eyes sparkled with delight. She pointed out another building. \u201cWhat about that spire? It\u2019s beautiful.\u201d\n\u201cThe church and clock tower. The bells ring out the hour.\u201d\n\u201cOoh, how wonderful! And it looks like there\u2019s a rather big market there too?\u201d\n\u201cYes, the largest market in the city. Carts line up in the early morning. Most of the offerings are made fresh every day.\u201d\n\u201cAmazing! And what about that pretty mountain over there?\u201d\nRishe tried and failed to contain her excitement. She couldn\u2019t help but imagine what seeing all these places up close would be like. The grand library, the beautiful church that told the time, and the morning market with fresh, delicious food\u2014she wanted to experience it all.\nSeeing Arnold\u2019s bemused face, she said, \u201cWhat?\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m just wondering where all this interest is coming from,\u201d he said. \u201cYou were so reluctant to come, yet here you are, brimming with curiosity for my city.\u201d\n\u201cWell\u2026\u201d she trailed off, unsure of how to respond.\nWhat should I say? Should I just tell him the truth?\nThis wasn\u2019t a secret, but talking about her hopes and dreams to the man who had killed her was a little awkward. A strange self-consciousness settled on her, her cheeks heating as she mumbled, \u201cBecause I\u2019ve always wanted to.\u201d\nArnold looked at her keenly. \u201cWanted to what?\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019ve always wanted to come here.\u201d\nDuring her life as a merchant, Rishe developed her single dream to visit everywhere in the world. That dream was cut tragically short when only one country remained: Galkhein.\nIn each of her consecutive lives, Rishe\u2019s priority became staying alive. Every time, without fail, just as she found her footing, the world was plunged into chaos. She never had the chance to see Galkhein. This betrothal was her chance. \u201cIt\u2019s probably why I agreed to marry you,\u201d she added after a moment\u2019s hesitation.\nArnold swept a tepid glance over the city. \u201cThere\u2019s nothing here worth seeing.\u201d\n\u201cThat\u2019s not true! The places you just told me about sound amazing! Your citizens are clean and happy, your knights are proper and kind. Oh, and another\u2014\u201d \nRishe broke off enumerating Galkhein\u2019s charms as Arnold turned to look at her. His face was impassively calm, but something seemed to pass by underneath, like a shadow in deep water.\n\u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d Rishe said. \u201cDid I say something odd?\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m just amazed you could be so unaware of yourself.\u201d \nWh-what a rude thing to\u2014\n\u201cI\u2019ve never met anyone like you. No one has ever spoken to me the way you do. I don\u2019t know any girls of your class with the knowledge or the physical abilities you possess. Noblewomen don\u2019t concern themselves with such things.\u201d\nRishe, there is no need for you to think for yourself.\nShe frowned. \u201cPerhaps you\u2019re right, but everything I\u2019ve learned is precious to me. No one can take my skills away\u2014I value them with my life. Some may say that my knowledge is worthless, but it makes no difference to me.\u201d She turned from the balcony, fixing him with a piercing gaze. \u201cI\u2019m the one who decides what I value.\u201d\nRishe had clawed free of her mother and father\u2019s indoctrination a long time ago. Man, woman\u2014it didn\u2019t matter. She could do anything. Being queen was not the culmination of her life; she wouldn\u2019t trade her freedom for anything.\nArnold matched her intensity. \u201cYou\u2019re right.\u201d He gently cupped her cheek in a one hand, swiping his thumb along the line of her jaw, smearing dust. \u201cLive your life here however you wish. I vow to do my utmost to protect you.\u201d\n\u201cHuh?\u201d\nHis vehemence took her by surprise. Arnold had every right to demand she act the part of a proper consort. This was a political marriage; Rishe was essentially a hostage, after all. Yet here he was, cosigning her misbehavior. Moreover, he was all but swearing to defend her from the consequences.\n\u201cWhy?\u201d\n\u201cYou know why. I\u2019m enamored with you.\u201d Arnold fed her the same line. \u201cI know you said you don\u2019t care about other people\u2019s approval, but I like your asymmetrical talents. I don\u2019t find them useless at all.\u201d \nRishe didn\u2019t know how to respond.\n\u201cI thought I\u2019d already made that clear.\u201d He took his hand back, drawing away, stopping just on the threshold. He turned back to a stunned Rishe and said, \u201cLet me know if there\u2019s anything you desire. I realize I just broke our agreement\u2014the one about not touching you.\u201d\nAnd with that, he was gone.\nShaken, Rishe sank to the floor of the balcony. I can\u2019t predict him at all! Just what is Arnold Hein planning?\nThe quiet of evening fell over the imperial capital of Galkhein.\n \n***\n \n\u201cMmm.\u201d\nSunshine streamed through the window as Rishe roused from sleep. She rolled over, basking in the morning light. The wall she expected wasn\u2019t there, and the bed seemed larger than usual. Taking advantage of it, she stretched out as far as she could.\nWas this her chamber at home? Or maybe she was a merchant again, spending a night at the desert king\u2019s palace. Perhaps this was her bed of straw from her life as a maid? Her memories met and interwove as she drifted into wakefulness.\nWhen Rishe finally opened her eyes, she grew even more confused.\nLight blue curtains surrounded the bed, thin enough to allow sunlight to pass through. She pulled them aside to find herself in a bare room devoid of furniture and carpet.\nOh, right. She didn\u2019t need to report for morning training, tend to her herb garden, prepare breakfast, or see how the bottles she had brewed overnight were coming along.\nRealizing that, Rishe buried her face in the pillow. \u201cSo soft,\u201d she murmured. \nJudging by the position of the sun, it was about six o\u2019clock in the morning. She was pretty sure she had gone to bed around midnight last night.\nI slept for six whole hours? Rishe couldn\u2019t believe it. Generally, she was used to getting about four hours of sleep. On bad days, at the height of an emergency as a knight or apothecary, she wouldn\u2019t even get that much. \nI\u2019ve got nothing but cleaning on the schedule today. Hostages can sleep in, right? At least a little? Excitement suffused her at the thought, but that was interrupted by a knock on the door.\n\u201cLady Rishe, are you awake? It\u2019s Oliver\u2014Prince Arnold\u2019s attendant.\u201d\nRishe sat up with a start. \u201cI\u2019m awake!\u201d\nOliver continued to speak through the door. \u201cI apologize for bothering you at such an early hour. I\u2019m here with a delivery.\u201d\n\u201cJust a moment!\u201d Rishe slipped out of the bed, dressed quickly, and tugged the bed\u2019s canopy closed. She opened the door to find Oliver standing in the hallway with a polite smile.\nHe apologized again. \u201cThis was the only time I could slip away from His Highness\u2019s office. I\u2019m glad to see that you\u2019re already dressed.\u201d\n\u201cNot at all.\u201d Rishe paused, stepping back to allow him inside. \u201cOh my. You look exhausted.\u201d\nOliver grimaced. \u201cIs it that obvious? We\u2019ve been climbing through mountains of paperwork, but never mind me. His Highness has been working around the clock.\u201d\nRishe thought back to yesterday, how he had come all the way out to the balcony. He should have used that spare time to sleep. \u201cHe\u2019s in high demand, isn\u2019t he? He was even working on the trip over.\u201d\n\u201cHe finished all the work he brought along with us,\u201d Oliver confirmed. \u201cNow he\u2019s dealing with everything that piled up during his visit to Hermity.\u201d\n\u201cOh.\u201d Rishe grimaced in sympathy. He may have killed her in a past life, but she wouldn\u2019t wish the bureaucracy of kingship on anyone. \u201cIt\u2019s a shame he had to put his work on hold to attend a silly engagement party.\u201d\n\u201cNo matter. That party was how a committed bachelor finally found a bride.\u201d\nHis smile was sincere, but Rishe knew better. She spread her arms. \u201cGo on. Shall I spin around so you have a better view?\u201d\nOliver blinked. \u201cI beg your pardon?\u201d\n\u201cYou\u2019re looking me over like I\u2019m a horse for sale. If there\u2019s anything I can help you with, please let me know.\u201d\nOliver\u2019s brows went up. He let out a little breath of resignation. \u201cHis Highness was right. You do possess the keen perception of a knight. Of course, I\u2019m purely an amateur myself.\u201d\nI\u2019d say this was a merchant\u2019s sixth sense, rather than battle intuition.\nThis wasn\u2019t the first time Rishe had caught Oliver looking at her. It reminded her of the way her noble customers would examine a product, assessing worth and authenticity. Or a merchant weeding out potential merchandise from a wide array of choices.\nIn other words, he was appraising her.\nOliver moved into a deep, sweeping bow. \u201cMy sincerest apologies, my lady. I have been unaccountably rude to my lord\u2019s consort. My behavior was unacceptable.\u201d\nRishe shook her head. \u201cPlease don\u2019t, it\u2019s fine.\u201d It wasn\u2019t unreasonable for the prince\u2019s closest attendant to be wary of strangers. But it did make her curious. \u201cHow long have you worked for Arnold? Have you always been a valet?\u201d\n\u201cI trained as a squire, actually,\u201d Oliver replied. \u201cBut I was injured and dismissed from the order. His Highness took me into his household soon after. I have served him for nearly a decade.\u201d\n\u201cThen maybe you can answer this,\u201d Rishe said. \u201cWhy is Prince Arnold so very intent on making me his wife?\u201d\nOliver hesitated, as if weighing the pros and cons of speaking, \u201cTo be quite honest, I was as surprised as you were. He\u2019s always insisted he had no interest in marriage. But the sight of you in Hermity has changed his mind. Apparently.\u201d\nSo not even his attendant understood his motives. Rishe remained at a complete loss.\n\u201cIf I may, however?\u201d Oliver mistook Rishe\u2019s confusion for anxiety and added, \u201cI have served Prince Arnold for a long time, and never before have I seen him so happy. When he is with you, he laughs. His smiles are sincere.\u201d\nRishe was taken aback. She\u2019d figured all of Arnold\u2019s laughter and teasing was at her expense. His own private jokes.\n\u201cAre you\u2026unhappy with him?\u201d Oliver ventured. \u201cWith his looks, His Highness is exceedingly popular with the ladies of the court, you know.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m sure he has many admirers.\u201d She paused. \u201cWould you really call the way he acts around me \u2018happy\u2019? To me, it seems more like a cat with a mouse.\u201d\nOliver laughed. He didn\u2019t deny it. \u201cI am pleased you understand His Highness so well. Oh, I nearly forgot. Here.\u201d\nHe held out a sheaf of three documents. \u201cThis is the guest list for your wedding. His Highness bids you look over it.\u201d\n\u201cThank you,\u201d Rishe said, pleasantly surprised. She hadn\u2019t even needed to ask. She gave it a quick glance, quickly identifying the most prominent and powerful names.\nKing Zahad, Prince Kyle, Princess Harriet. And from the Kingdom of Domana, we have Lord Jonal attending as the representative of the king. No surprise there.\nMore than a wedding guest register, this was a list of key people from the countries Arnold would go on to antagonize. Even before the murder of the king and the start of the war, there must have been a trigger\u2014a sea change in the affairs of state. Everyone on this list was most likely involved.\nKing Zahad. I hope we can be friends again like in my first life. Hmm\u2026 Prince Kyle is rather frail. I hope he isn\u2019t working himself too hard. He has a strong sense of responsibility\u2014he\u2019ll attend the wedding even though it\u2019ll be a long trip.\nThe sight of these names filled Rishe with a longing for those lives, for the people she\u2019d once known. And sometime in the very near future, they would all be Galkhein\u2019s enemies.\nIf I take matters into my own hands, perhaps I can salvage some of these relationships before they sour. Even if we aren\u2019t allies, we don\u2019t have to be enemies. Anything to stave off the outbreak of war.\nOliver had no idea what was going through Rishe\u2019s head. Brightly, he continued their conversation. \u201cThe ceremony will be held in three months\u2019 time. All preparations must be complete by then. And now\u2026we need to discuss tonight\u2019s party.\u201d\n\u201cTonight\u2019s what?\u201d\nOliver stiffened. \u201cDid His Highness not tell you?\u201d\n\u201cNo, he most certainly did not! There\u2019s to be a party?\u201d\n\u201cUgh, not again!\u201d Oliver dug his knuckles into his forehead.\nRishe put two and two together. She hesitated, then said, \u201cSo there is one, then. As you must know, His Highness is trying to stamp it down without telling me.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d Oliver replied. \u201cHe should have mentioned it to you. You don\u2019t need to attend, but he will. At least, I hope he will. I think I managed to convince him.\u201d\nShe sympathized with Oliver. Under normal circumstances, it would be unheard of for the crown prince and his fianc\u00e9e to fail to appear at a banquet. \u201cDon\u2019t worry, Oliver. I\u2019ll go.\u201d\nOliver let out a sigh of relief. \u201cReally? Thank you so much, my lady. I\u2019ll put finding you a maid at the top of my to-do list.\u201d\n\u201cNo need.\u201d Rishe smiled. \u201cI can prepare for the party on my own.\u201d\nThis maid-selection process made Rishe uneasy. After witnessing that exchange between the servants in the garden, she imagined quarrels breaking out all through the palace. And she doubted the disputes would go away even after they decided.\nOliver frowned. \u201cBut won\u2019t dressing be difficult without a lady\u2019s maid?\u201d \nShe shook her head. \u201cI can do",
    "query_text": " my hair and put on a gown by myself. I brought dresses and cosmetics from home. Don\u2019t worry.\u201d\nRishe ignored Oliver\u2019s stunned look, already reevaluating her cleaning plans.\n \n***\n \nThe first thing Rishe said to Arnold that night was, \u201cYour Highness, I have a request.\u201d Her gown rustled as she leaned in close. \u201cI would like some herb seed and a corner of the gardens. I made a list. I hope we can discuss this in more detail later.\u201d\nArnold was silent a moment. \u201cRishe.\u201d\n\u201cWhat? Didn\u2019t you tell me to let you know if there was anything I wanted?\u201d She looked at him quizzically, and Arnold sighed.\nShe\u2019d heard that he\u2019d finished his mountain of work and even managed to sleep for a while. He was dressed in his usual military black, trimmed with a red mantle and"

    "prefix_text": ". He didn\u2019t seem like the dancing type, but his movements were slick and effortless. Facing one another, they joined hands. Arnold wrapped his other arm around her waist. \nOoh. His hand felt huge against her back. She realized she was breathing a little faster. They\u2019d never been this close before.\nNo, that isn\u2019t quite true. This is the second time. Rishe\u2019s final memories from her last life flashed vividly through her mind.\nThis was indeed the second time they had been this close\u2014the first had ended with a sword through her chest.\nEmperor Arnold Hein had single-handedly decimated the knights in the castle. Rishe stood in the midst of the carnage, breath ragged as she gripped the hilt of her sword, slick with her own blood. She was the last line of defense. The chamber behind her housed the royal family.\nIf they could reach the hidden passageways, the young prince and his party could find shelter with their allies across the border. Rishe and the other knights were prepared to sacrifice their lives to allow the royal family to survive. Their escape meant victory.\nBells tolled out, urging flight. All is lost. Run. Rishe managed to graze Arnold\u2019s cheek with her blade before she looked down to find his jet-black sword blooming out of her chest.\nShe remembered how it burned, as if the blade was made of fire. It was heat, not pain, but her breathing grew labored, and when Emperor Arnold Hein withdrew his sword, Rishe crumpled. \nHe knelt by her side and whispered something.\nThe words were seared into her memory. Rishe squeezed Arnold\u2019s hand as they danced.\nI\u2019ll be the bully this time. \nRishe shifted her weight back, slipping out of the hold on her waist. She broke Arnold\u2019s lead and spun, drifting on the harmony of the dance. She took him by surprise; his eyes went wide.\nI wonder what you\u2019ll do when you\u2019re no longer on top, Your Highness. Her smile was a declaration of war. Watching him attempt to follow her lead would be delightful. She pulled his hand toward her, attempting to move them into a spin.\nBut Arnold held fast. He planted his hand on her waist and turned them in a different direction, using her inertia against her. Hey! As a result, Rishe twirled by herself on the spot.\nShe didn\u2019t miss a step. She turned elegantly, the hem of her dress whispering across the ballroom floor. She heard appreciative murmurs from the wallflowers lined up watching.\nDespite that, Rishe took it as a defeat. Round one to Arnold. \nSo\u2026you can think on your feet. How about this?\nArnold remained unruffled, evading her next scheme like it was nothing. He grinned down at her, his eyes shining with a dare.\nHe thinks I can\u2019t beat him. His ease vexed her, but it was his smugness that made her angry.\nShe let out a hard breath, attempting a maneuver to lure him in while turning. He leaned back, not falling for it at all.\nHe\u2019s just too good at changing his center of gravity! She kept her astonishment under wraps, but she felt it. Despite how close we\u2019re dancing, I can\u2019t throw off his timing at all. He\u2019s sidestepped all my attempts, and he takes back the lead the second I let down my guard!\nIt made her increasingly angry. She twirled and stepped as the dance dictated, all the while feeling out for moments of weakness. Arnold played along with her game, completely unruffled.\nEvery single time. I\u2019m doing my utmost to trip him up, but he doesn\u2019t even seem annoyed! At this point she\u2019d just settle for any reaction at all.\nTheir unusual dance style had gathered a crowd. Rishe paid them no mind, focused only on her goal. Then something occurred to her, and her breath caught in her throat.\nWait a minute, he has left an opening. It\u2019s the same one from before. She thought back to their fight to the death, to that moment when she had managed to draw blood. That may indeed have been his only weakness.\nIf I strike the same way\u2014huh? Before she could try, Arnold appeared to lose patience, wrapping his arm around her waist. He bent her back into a dip so deep it felt like he\u2019d pulled a carpet from under her feet. She yelped, grabbing at him reflexively, clinging tight. His big hands gripped her securely enough to mitigate the sensation of falling. Relief flooded through her, and she felt a laugh rumble against her ear.\nThe music came to an end with one last ringing note. She blinked. The dance is over?\nA hush fell over the ballroom. Then cheers broke out, followed by a round of applause.\n\u201cThat was incredible!\u201d\nThe watching nobles crowded in.\n\u201cYou two moved in such perfect harmony!\u201d\n\u201cI was on the edge of my seat. I felt like I was watching a sword duel!\u201d\n\u201cIs this a dance from Hermity? I\u2019ve never seen such steps before.\u201d\n\u201cUh, well\u2026\u201d Rishe floundered. She glanced up at Arnold, who appeared to be enjoying her struggle. She\u2019d get no help from him.\nRishe dealt with the barrage of questions as best she could, letting the crowd sweep them into the dining room, which was set up for a buffet-style meal. She made sure to greet every guest, riveting their faces into her memory.\nShe must have been acting peculiar, because Arnold eventually said, \u201cRishe, I think the wine is getting to you. Shall we get some fresh air?\u201d\nRishe hadn\u2019t touched a single drop. In fact, she\u2019d been caught up in so many conversations that she hadn\u2019t even had the chance to eat, but she had experience working on an empty stomach. She accepted Arnold\u2019s encouragement as the escape it was.\nJust when I least expect it, he\u2019ll act the gentleman. Maybe he\u2019d remembered her demand for a carefree life of doing nothing.\nRishe cast a charming look across the crowd. \u201cThank you for your consideration, Your Highness. Forgive me.\u201d She gave a polite bow before quietly slipping away. \nShe didn\u2019t head straight to the balcony but rather slowly walked around the hall. There was only so much she could find out glued to Arnold\u2019s side all night.\nI need information. Galkhein\u2019s political landscape was a mystery to me through all my past lives. I only know the rumors that made it abroad.\nAlthough she knew of Arnold\u2019s eventual patricide, she had no concept of the circumstances leading up to it. She needed a better picture of the factions and power balance inside the court. The lives these people led.\nI know better than to believe wartime gossip. This Arnold Hein is a lot different from what I\u2019d heard he was like at nineteen. He\u2019s not as diabolical as the rumors led me to believe. He likes to push, but he isn\u2019t unkind. The thought drifted across her mind, leaving her conflicted. Well, he\u2019s not unkind now. But I still don\u2019t like not knowing his motives. And he\u2019s a bit of a jerk, to be honest. \nShe tried to settle her mind and just observe. Gathering intelligence was necessary to lead a long, carefree life lazing around the palace.\nIf I recall correctly, that\u2019s Lord Hannawald. He seems to be on good terms with Count Gayle. Duke Hudemann and Duke Teinitz are having a friendly enough conversation, yet they don\u2019t seem close. Rishe ticked off the names of people she\u2019d met, committing them to memory.\nA wave of sweet perfume wafted over her. A pretty girl with soft blonde hair had appeared at her side. \u201cHow do you do, Lady Rishe? I\u2019m Cornelia Thea Toona.\u201d\nDuke Toona\u2019s family was the thirty-first house she\u2019d met tonight.\nRishe smiled graciously. \u201cRishe Irmgard Weitzner. A pleasure to meet you.\u201d\n\u201cThe pleasure is all mine.\u201d Cornelia smiled sweetly. Her eyes were big and bright, her lips full. She held a glass in each hand and offered one to Rishe. \u201cWine? I see you\u2019re empty-handed.\u201d\nA gaggle of other ladies nearby began giggling among themselves.\n\u201cHow dare she act so haughty when she\u2019s a captive. It\u2019s time for her learn just what she is. A pawn to be played and discarded.\u201d\n\u201cShe should enjoy her time on Prince Arnold\u2019s arm while she can.\u201d\n\u201cShe is from a minor nation, after all.\u201d\nAs Rishe took note of their whispers, Cornelia gazed at her with doe eyes. \u201cDoes my offering offend you in some way?\u201d\nIf I remember correctly, House Toona holds a vast territory in southern Galkhein.\nRishe held out a hand to accept the glass. \u201cHow could it? Thank you, Lady Cornelia.\u201d\nBefore Rishe could touch the glass, Cornelia gave a dramatic shout. \u201cOh dear! My hand slipped!\u201d She dropped it, quite obviously on purpose. Without thinking, Rishe grabbed her skirts and leaned back, plucking the glass out of the air with the other hand.\nCornelia let out a cry of surprise as Rishe caught the wine before any could spill. She swirled the glass and brought it to her nose to breathe in the bouquet.\nHmm\u2026 That\u2019s mashed capsicum. Where did she even get that? What a waste of perfectly good wine. And why bother spicing it enough to singe the tongue if she just planned to ruin my dress? Pick a plan, my dear.\nHiding her exasperation, Rishe smiled brightly. \u201cI\u2019ve never had a wine quite like this. What an unusual scent.\u201d\nCornelia bit her lip in frustration. Rishe beamed at her. You\u2019ve got such a pretty face, Lady Toona. Why don\u2019t you smile?\nRishe leaned in close to Cornelia. \u201cThis vintage isn\u2019t available where I\u2019m from. I\u2019m ever so anxious to learn more. Should I perhaps invite Prince Arnold over to enjoy a glass? Which tray did you get this from?\u201d\n\u201cWhat? Oh, um\u2026\u201d Rishe had a policy of never backing down from a fight, but it seemed Cornelia didn\u2019t share it. \u201cS-sorry, but I don\u2019t remember. Such a large hall, you see.\u201d\n\u201cA shame. I\u2019ll just give His Highness this one, then. I\u2019ll be sure to let him know who it\u2019s from.\u201d\n\u201cUh, wait!\u201d Cornelia rapidly shook her head. \u201cI-I got that glass for you, so I think you should\u2014you know what? Never mind! Maybe I should just take that\u2014oh no!\u201d\nRishe ignored the ashen-faced Cornelia, raising the glass and swallowing down a gulp. \n\u201cI-I can\u2019t believe\u2026\u201d\n\u201cSuch a spicy flavor, just as I imagined.\u201d Rishe smiled again to the assembled group\u2019s astonishment. \u201cWhat a warm welcome. I do hope the two of us can spend more time together. Perhaps\u2026a tea party?\u201d\n\u201cTh-the two of us?\u201d Cornelia stammered.\n\u201cYes. I want to know all about House Toona.\u201d\nCornelia looked flabbergasted, but she recovered herself and nodded.\nThat should do. One of Rishe\u2019s eventual plans required a plot of land in a temperate climate. House Toona\u2019s would likely be perfect, but she needed to confirm a few things with Cornelia. Never back down from a fight. Even further\u2026\nShe recalled the words of her mentor from her days as a merchant.\nDon\u2019t bother with fights you can\u2019t win.\nThe other ladies fled, fearful of this strange girl who gulped down painfully spicy wine like it was nothing. \n \n***\n \nRishe retreated to the empty balcony to enjoy the music, grimacing with every stinging mouthful of wine. She drank it in decreasing sips until Arnold joined her.\n\u201cWhat are you making that face for?\u201d\nRishe swirled the glass. \u201cDon\u2019t worry, it\u2019s not you. It\u2019s just this wine is so spicy.\u201d\n\u201cSpicy? The wine is?\u201d\n\u201cMm. It\u2019s seasoned with capsicum. I barely managed to get that first mouthful down without gagging.\u201d\nArnold swiped the glass from her hand. \u201cDon\u2019t tell me this was a poisoning attempt!\u201d\nRishe clicked her tongue in annoyance at her own lack of vigilance. No one else would be able to grab something from her so easily.\nArnold glared at the wine. \u201cYou don\u2019t need to drink this. I\u2019ll get rid of it.\u201d\n\u201cHey, give that back! They ruined a perfectly good glass of wine because of me. I",
    "query_text": "\u2019m not going to waste it.\u201d She grabbed it back and took another sip, shuddering at the taste.\nArnold glowered. \u201cTell me who did this. I\u2019ll have them executed.\u201d\n\u201cDon\u2019t be ridiculous. You don\u2019t kill people like her\u2014you use them.\u201d Just the tiniest bit of wine to go, but it was getting harder to make herself drink it. She gave the glass a reproachful look, then glanced back at Arnold. \u201cOh, and I owe"

She worked with him.\u201d\n\u201cI heard that as well,\u201d added another maid. \u201cBut he fell into debt and had to sell off.\u201d \nRishe stopped scrubbing for a moment to consider this.\n\u201cUm, is something the matter?\u201d Elsie asked.\nRishe smiled and shook her head. \u201cNo, nothing. Let\u2019s just focus on getting these washed for the time being.\u201d\n \n***\n \nThat afternoon, thirty maids were assembled in the detached wing of the palace. Ten of them were old hands, long in service to the royal family, while the other twenty were freshly hired. The crown princess was to choose her maids from among these thirty. They wore their nerves plainly on their sleeves. \n\u201cHey, I thought this palace was in a terrible state of neglect,\u201d one maid whispered. \u201cWhy is it so sparkling clean?\u201d\n\u201cYeah, you\u2019re right,\u201d said another. \u201cSomeone must have sorted it out before we arrived.\u201d\n\u201cI wonder what kind of person Lady Rishe is. Ooh, I\u2019m so nervous.\u201d\nThe girls looked around anxiously.\n\u201cHey, Elsie, that girl who was always helping us isn\u2019t here.\u201d\nElsie blinked. \u201cYou\u2019re right.\u201d\n\u201cLook, Diana. That impertinent newbie didn\u2019t get picked.\u201d \nAt her friend\u2019s observation, Diana preened with satisfaction. \u201cNo surprise there. You need some manners to attend to Lady Rishe. I bet she got kicked out of the running!\u201d Her eyes sparkled with confidence.\nAt last, there was a knock at the door.\n\u201cHer Royal Highness, Princess Rishe.\u201d\nThe maids quickly fell into bows. Diana\u2019s chest ached with anticipation as heels clicked on the floor, approaching the line of girls. From the corner of their eyes, the maids saw a wide-skirted court dress. A gentle scent washed over them.\nWithout even looking at her, they could tell Crown Princess Rishe was a lovely woman. Diana and her friends swelled with pride that she was to become their mistress.\nBut then Laura whispered to Diana, \u201cHey, isn\u2019t this scent familiar?\u201d\n\u201cQuiet!\u201d Clearly it was some sort of expensive perfume. Or so Diana thought, but then she realized what it was. The words just slipped out. \u201cIt\u2019s soap.\u201d\n\u201cHuh? Did you just say something?\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s soap. The same kind we always use.\u201d Diana was sure of it.\nThe princess said, \u201cPlease rise.\u201d \nWhy did her voice sound so familiar? An incredible foreboding gripping her, Diana looked up. She gasped.\n\u201cMy name is Rishe Irmgard Weitzner.\u201d\nBefore her stood the beautiful newcomer\u2014the thorn in her side for the past few days. The smile she wore was peaceful and just the slightest bit satisfied.\n \n***\n \nI\u2019m so glad I managed to finish washing the sheets in time!\nStanding before the maids with Arnold\u2019s attendant Oliver at her side, Rishe was panicking on the inside. She\u2019d had so much to do this morning that she\u2019d put off the laundry to the last minute. She took deep, controlled breaths, praying no one would notice that she\u2019d raced here at a dead sprint.\nOliver was none the wiser as he spoke to the assembled girls. Rishe took the opportunity to look them over. She locked eyes with Elsie, who was gaping at her. It was a nice change\u2014usually her face was as blank as a rock wall.\nI\u2019m sorry for the deception. I figured blending in would give me the best picture of your working conditions.\nThe new maids wore similarly shocked expressions, while others watched her with delight. Meanwhile, the veterans, including Diana, had all gone pale. They trembled, stunned into silence. One seemed locked in a terrifying trance, while another looked on the verge of tears. All of them had spoken to Rishe with derision. As the ringleader, Diana was covering her mouth with both hands, like she was holding in a scream.\nOliver had finished his introduction. \u201cYour Highness, if you would?\u201d\nRishe stepped forward. \u201cFirst, I must apologize to you for what has transpired prior to this meeting. My deception, that is. However, it has granted me insight into how each one of you works.\u201d\nOliver\u2019s face creased in confusion. The newcomer maids began to panic, whispering among themselves.\n\u201cDoesn\u2019t this mean that she helped us out with the laundry?\u201d\n\u201cWe\u2019re going to be fired!\u201d\n\u201cIf I lose my position, my brother will have to quit school!\u201d\nNoticing the commotion, Oliver glanced at Rishe. \u201cYour Highness, two-thirds of these maids are newly recruited from the city. Since the majority of the castle maids were elderly, His Highness assumed you would prefer maids closer in age to yourself.\u201d\nRishe was startled. She had found it odd that most of her potential servants were new hires, but she hadn\u2019t expected this to be the reason.\n\u201cWhile the prince has entrusted the selection of your maids to you,\u201d Oliver went on. \u201cHiring someone with no experience will not do. Despite Prince Arnold\u2019s views, I urge you to reject the newcomers.\u201d\n\u201cOliver.\u201d\n\u201cI have a list of their names here. Elsie\u2014\u201d\n\u201cElsie, Nichole, Hilde, Marguerite, Rosa.\u201d Rishe began listing the names of the newly recruited maids. She\u2019d made a point to memorize them in the washhouse. \u201cElke, Amelia, and\u2014\u201d\nOliver looked at her wildly. \u201cYou know them all?! Even though they\u2019ve never served you in the past?\u201d\n\u201cYes, of course I do. Servants are essential to the maintenance of our lifestyle, why wouldn\u2019t I get to know them?\u201d Rishe listed the remaining names for good measure. \u201cAll twenty of you, listen to me.\u201d \nThe new maids stiffened. Diana and the other maids whose names hadn\u2019t been called were getting their wind back, wearing increasingly triumphant looks.\nRishe said, \u201cThe twenty names I just called will be my maids.\u201d\nTime seemed to stand still a moment, and then Oliver broke in with an astonished, \u201cB-but, my lady! They are all inexperienced\u2014\u201d\n\u201cYes. And my palace will be the perfect place to learn.\u201d\nThe new recruits were completely speechless, unsure of exactly what was happening. \nRishe smiled at Elsie. \u201cI hope you\u2019ll serve me well, Elsie.\u201d\nElsie was still frozen in place. \u201cHuh? Y-yes, my lady, but\u2014\u201d\nA shaking Diana cried out, \u201cBut why, my lady?! You\u2019ve seen their work! They\u2019re useless, the lot of them! The rest of us get so much more done in a shorter amount of time!\u201d\n\u201cWatch your tongue, girl,\u201d Oliver said sharply.\nDiana ignored him. \u201cWe\u2019re hard workers! Any job you assign us, we can do it! Please, I beg you, my lady!\u201d\n\u201cStep back,\u201d Oliver warned. \u201cDo not take a single step closer to Lady Rishe.\u201d\nDiana spoke in a rush, words pouring out of her. \u201cI-I freely admit that I was impolite before, but I didn\u2019t know who she was! I\u2019ll take any punishment, so please, give me the chance to show you how well I can work!\u201d\nRishe said, \u201cDiana, I have a request.\u201d\n\u201cTh-thank you, my lady!\u201d Diana heaved a sigh of relief. \u201cYou mean you\u2019ll\u2014\u201d \nRishe cut across her. \u201cAs of today, you are no longer a maid in this palace.\u201d \n\u201cWhat?\u201d Her face, usually so fixed with determination, paled. \u201cBut why? I\u2019m so much better than any of them! I\u2019ll do a perfect job no matter what task you set before me. Please don\u2019t dismiss me, my lady!\u201d \n\u201cListen to me, Diana.\u201d Rishe dropped her lofty tone, speaking as one woman would to another. \u201cYou have noticed it, haven\u2019t you? No matter what you claim, these new girls aren\u2019t worthless.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2026I don\u2019t understand.\u201d\n\u201cCan you remember your first month in service? How difficult it was?\u201d\nDiana looked completely bewildered. Her gaze darted around as if looking for help.\nPulling herself together, she forced herself to follow Rishe\u2019s directions. She thought back and finally alighted on a response. \u201cI\u2026I didn\u2019t know how to do the job. Before, when my family was still prominent, I\u2019d washed shirts and bedsheets. Never gowns or military uniforms.\u201d\n\u201cPerfectly reasonable,\u201d Rishe said. \u201cOnly natural for someone just starting out.\u201d\n\u201cThe older girls were so busy, they told me to just watch them since they didn\u2019t have time to teach me. When I had questions\u2026well, there was nobody to ask.\u201d\n\u201cI bet. And did you have any other problems?\u201d\n\u201cWell, yes. There was a lot to learn. Different kinds of soap and washboards depending on the cloth. You use different tools for different materials. I had to learn how they worked and how to put them away. I was\u2026punished if I didn\u2019t get it right the first time.\u201d\nThe newcomers were exchanging surprised looks. Rishe understood why.\nEverything Diana said was familiar to them. They spent valuable time searching for their materials and the proper ways to use them, but they shrank from asking for help. Everyone always looked so busy. This was a universal problem.\n\u201cDespite all that, I got better!\u201d Diana protested. \u201cI only needed to be taught once. Unlike them! They\u2019re useless!\u201d\n\u201cYes, well. There\u2019s a difference between you and them,\u201d Rishe told Diana. \u201cYou can read and write.\u201d\n\u201cOh!\u201d Diana started in surprise. Elsie looked at the floor.\nThe literacy rate among commoners was low no matter where you went. Very few families had the means to afford an education, especially for daughters. Diana had been born to a merchant\u2019s family\u2014she\u2019d received formal schooling. The maids she was close friends with were likely from similar backgrounds. The majority of those in service were not so fortunate.\n\u201cWhat if you only received instructions on how to do a job once and weren\u2019t able to write it down to remind yourself later?\u201d Rishe asked. \u201cWould you be so confident?\u201d\n\u201cI-I don\u2019t\u2014\u201d Diana reflexively thrust a hand into her apron pocket, where she had a list of daily tasks recorded in her neat handwriting to reference throughout the day. Hopefully now she would understand how much of an edge her privileged literacy gave her over the other maids.\n\u201cEveryone else works as hard as they can, just like you do,\u201d Rishe said. \u201cRemember how it was for you at first? They all have to start somewhere. I hope you\u2019ll keep that in mind.\u201d\n\u201cThey\u2019re no different from me,\u201d Diana mumbled begrudgingly, glancing around the room, looking at the less experienced maids. As if coming to a decision, she said, \u201cI\u2019m sorry.\u201d\n\u201cDiana?\u201d\nLike a child enumerating her regrets, Diana went on, \u201cI\u2019ve done you wrong, all of you. It\u2019s just, I had nothing. Or so it felt like. No money, no title. I thought I had to make my way in the world on my own. That I had to start from zero.\u201d Her shoulders trembled as she buried her face in her hands. \u201cBut I was wrong! I wasn\u2019t starting from zero. I had everything that I learned growing up. I didn\u2019t realize",

That war was lost before it began.\nArnold\u2019s brilliance lay not in his swordplay but in his skill as a tactician. He set countries up for conquest and knocked them down, swallowing them one by one.\nI know him, but he doesn\u2019t know me. We haven\u2019t met in this life. I need an excuse fast. \nRishe curtsied slowly. \u201cMy name is Rishe Irmgard Weitzner. We\u2019ve never been introduced, but I\u2019ve heard of you.\u201d\nArnold donned an amused smile. \u201cYou plant your weight like a trained swordswoman. Your center of gravity is perfect.\u201d\n\u201cYou exaggerate,\u201d Rishe demurred. \u201cThat was simply a curtsy to an esteemed guest.\u201d \n\u201cI must have misheard, but I swear you called me \u2018emperor\u2019 just now.\u201d \nRishe froze.\n\u201cMy father yet lives,\u201d Arnold said. \u201cI am simply a crown prince. Why would you call me that?\u201d \n\u201cUh, um\u2026\u201d Rishe floundered for an answer.\nShe\u2019d made such a foolish mistake. Arnold\u2019s gaze cut right through her. It felt like he\u2019d see through any lie she told right down to her soul. She remembered this from the battlefield\u2014how his attention alone felt like a sword thrust.\nBut why even bother to lie? They\u2019d never meet again, so who cared what he thought of her? Sure, she harbored a hard feeling or two over the recent slaying, but there was no point complaining about it to this Arnold. Calling him the emperor was boorish, but Rishe was in the process of being forcibly exiled. Why play at diplomacy?\nShe took a deep breath and bowed low. This was not the curtsy of a noble lady but of a servant bowing in supplication to her master.\n\u201cMy humblest apologies, Your Highness. I was in a rush. Such a rude slip of the tongue.\u201d She raised her head. \u201cMy ex-fianc\u00e9 just annulled our engagement, so I\u2019ve got a lot on my mind. If you would excuse me.\u201d \n\u201cHe annulled your engagement?\u201d\nAt that, Rishe turned and fled.\nThis unexpected run-in with Arnold had taken up valuable time. She threw open the door to the balcony and hiked up her skirts, kicking off her shoes in anticipation of jumping into a tree. Looking down, she realized the ground was far closer than she\u2019d feared.\nExcellent! I can just drop into the garden!\nArnold, who up until now had been rendered speechless, shook himself out of his fugue as Rishe clambered over the railing. \u201cHey!\u201d\nRishe\u2019s moonlight-silver dress flowed around her as she leapt. The lawn was soft, but the fall was still far enough to risk injury.\nWeight evenly distributed on the soles of my feet, roll to transfer the impact to my shins and thighs, then onto my hips and my back.\nShe landed safely, rolled nimbly in her dress, and popped back up. Her hair was covered in leaves. \nI need to hurry up!\nBracing against a nearby rock, she used her weight to snap the heels off of her shoes. There. That would make running a little easier. Satisfied, she slipped them back on and made haste toward the family estate. \n \n***\n \nUp on the balcony, Crown Prince Arnold of Galkhein watched the spectacle play out from beginning to end. He gazed at the girl with the coral hair. Her appearance was that of any young noblewoman, but she moved like a well-trained knight. She\u2019d leapt from the balcony and landed skillfully, showing no signs of distress at her ripped dress or disheveled hair. Instead, she\u2019d knocked the heels off her shoes and dashed away.\nAlso, she had called him an emperor.\nPlaying it all over again in his head, Arnold broke out into a rare chuckle. As his shoulders quivered with laughter, his attendant approached him from behind.\n\u201cThere you are, Your Highness. What are you doing out here? I\u2019m aware you don\u2019t desire a wife, but beginning the search would be wise\u2026 Er, Your Highness?\u201d The attendant\u2019s eyes flew wide. His bored and scowling master was laughing. \u201cDid something happen?\u201d\n\u201cOliver, ready my coach. Wait, no. That will take too much time. Bring me a horse.\u201d\n\u201cAt once, Your Highness. Might I ask why?\u201d\nArnold didn\u2019t respond\u2014he just grinned like a hungry wolf catching scent of his prey.\n \n***\n \nOnce outside the palace gates, Rishe threw herself into the waiting coach, shouting for the driver to make haste. She stopped it a few hundred yards from the manor and bid him farewell. \u201cI\u2019m leaving! Thanks for always being such a safe driver, Daniel!\u201d\nThe road to the manor was muddy from a morning rain shower. She knew from her second life that the coach would get stuck, resulting in a loss of valuable time. It was better to just get out and run. \n\u201cHuff, huff.\u201d Despite her last life\u2019s physical conditioning, this body had no stamina. She\u2019d need to try to get fitter faster this time around.\nRishe reached the end of the road, and her heart promptly sank all the way to her feet. \u201cOh no.\u201d\nThe front door was thronged with people, all of them surrounding a carriage bearing the royal family\u2019s coat of arms.\nI need to get out of here.\nWhile she stood frozen in indecision, one of the knights doing crowd control shouted, \u201cYour Highness! I have eyes on Lady Rishe!\u201d\n\u201cGet out of my way!\u201d A familiar voice started up a bellow. \u201cLet me through! Rishe, how dare you make me wait so long?\u201d\nRishe\u2019s ex-fianc\u00e9, Crown Prince Dietrich, stepped triumphantly forward.\n\u201cI know the thought of hearing your crimes enumerated by the man you love must pain you, but alas, as future king, it is my duty to bring down the hammer of justice upon a villainess such as yourself!\u201d\n\u201cI see I\u2019ve timed it badly,\u201d Rishe muttered. \u201cIn fact, this is my worst loop yet. I\u2019d rather be barred from the house than see you again.\u201d\n\u201cHmm? What are you grumbling about?\u201d Dietrich looked Rishe up and down. \u201cI knew it. You put on a brave face, but I can sense the sorrow in your heart.\u201d\n\u201cI beg your pardon?\u201d\n\u201cYour heart!\u201d the prince repeated. \u201cYour heart! It must be absolutely crushed! Because I called off our engagement!\u201d\nRishe wasn\u2019t sure where he was drawing these conclusions from. Possibly the same place he mined for all his bottomless self-confidence.\n\u201cI can tell you\u2019ve been wandering aimlessly, distraught,\u201d the prince went on. \u201cLook at you. Your dress is caked in mud, your shoes are broken, and there are cuts marring your face and arms. What other possible cause could there be than heartbreak?\u201d\nRishe narrowed her eyes. \u201cDo you ever stop to think about the words coming out of your mouth?\u201d\n\u201cWhat?\u201d\nHis interpretation of events was fanciful to the point of absurdity. \u201cI did not dirty my dress or snap my shoes out of heartbreak. Because I feel none. You\u2019ve always been a little slow, so I\u2019ll make this clear: I do not have a single shred of fondness for you, or for our broken engagement.\u201d\n\u201cWhat?!\u201d the prince said. \u201cWhat are you saying?!\u201d\nThe surrounding crowd began to snicker.\n\u201cIsn\u2019t that the crown prince? Did Lady Rishe just dump him?\u201d\n\u201cWait, but wasn\u2019t he trying to dump her?\u201d\n\u201cCan\u2019t be! Look at her! She doesn\u2019t care at all!\u201d\n\u201cHow dare you nobodies make sport of me?\u201d Dietrich screeched. \u201cI am your prince!\u201d\nTemper aside, Dietrich was a handsome man. He had azure-blue eyes and blond hair\u2014a prince straight out of a picture book. His looks and place in the succession meant a never-ending swarm of women vying for his affections. He was brought up a pampered princeling, never wanting for anything. It manifested in a pompous manner and an overconfidence in his own abilities. Rishe had cautioned him about his attitude before, but he never paid her any mind.\nI\u2019m so glad I don\u2019t have to marry him.\nShe wished she could go back and tell the shocked, scared girl from her first life not to worry about her shattered engagement. Still, she might as well say it all here and now, with the assembled knights and citizens to bear witness.\n\u201cYour Highness, you exist to love and protect your people. It\u2019s unbecoming to speak of them in this manner.\u201d\n\u201cYou\u2019re the unbecoming one!\u201d the prince snapped. \u201cBeg me for forgiveness!\u201d\n\u201cI won\u2019t. Calling off our betrothal is the best course, and I applaud Your Highness for your good sense.\u201d\nNow even the knights were trembling with suppressed mirth. \nDietrich was turning red. \u201cD-don\u2019t laugh at me!\u201d\n\u201cLady Rishe,\u201d came a sweet voice. \u201cAren\u2019t you ashamed of yourself?\u201d \nRishe fought down a groan.\nOut of the crowd stepped a charming, dainty girl. Her big eyes moist with tears, she took her place at Dietrich\u2019s side. \u201cI do not allow the people I care about to be treated so very ill!\u201d \n\u201cWhy, Lady Mary. You\u2019re here.\u201d Rishe sighed. \u201cHow nice.\u201d\nThe young Mary scowled through her tears. Hidden behind her skirts, Dietrich continued to shout his disapproval. \u201cRishe! You\u2019ve brought my beloved Mary to tears! She\u2019s told me everything. How you bullied her, ridiculed her. How you find it amusing to lock her in the classroom overnight! Such a wicked woman could never be queen!\u201d\nNone of that\u2019s true.\nRishe glanced at Mary, who averted her gaze a little awkwardly.\n\u201cMore importantly,\u201d Rishe said, \u201chave you already brought your concerns to my parents, Your Highness?\u201d\n\u201cMore importantly?! I did, if you must know! Your parents are furious. They have vowed to disown you.\u201d\n\u201cAh. Then I\u2019m too late.\u201d Her parents held their reputation above all else. Rishe had little hope of retrieving any of her money or belongings now.\n\u201cWhy are you acting so strangely?\u201d Dietrich sniffed. \u201cAh, I understand. You\u2019re in such shock from this turn of events that\u2014\u201d\n\u201cListen, Dietrich.\u201d In her exasperation, Rishe dropped his title. \u201cI accept your decree. We are no longer engaged. I shall never darken your doorstep again. So\u2026relax a little.\u201d\n\u201cHuh? What are you saying?\u201d\n\u201cSince I was a child, I believed that my only value was in our betrothal. Being engaged to the crown prince was my whole reason for living. I was wrong about that. Only I determine my value\u2014no one else. That\u2019s why I don\u2019t care about this. I\u2019m beyond it.\u201d Rishe made sure to look him directly in the eye as she spoke. \u201cYou are an unnecessary element in my life.\u201d\nDietrich staggered back. His legs seemed to go out from under him, and he crumpled. At that, the knights finally let go of their composure, laughing along with the courtiers.\n\u201cSt-stop!\u201d the prince wailed. \u201cYou are my subjects. This\u2026this shows such flagrant disrespect!\u201d\n\u201cDietrich, don\u2019t pay them any mind,\u201d Lady Mary said. \u201cLady Rishe, is this cruelty necessary?\u201d\n\u201cPerhaps this is a blessing in disguise.\u201d Rishe\u2019s attention moved to Mary, making the girl\u2019s slender shoulders jump. She had no reason to worry; Rishe didn\u2019t bite. \u201cI\u2019ve been wanting the opportunity to speak to you, Lady Mary. You\u2019re strong. I admire you very much.\u201d\n\u201cWhat are you talking about?\u201d\n\u201cYou\u2019re a lovely girl who never fails to smile despite your troubles. You don\u2019t put up walls around your heart, and you do your utmost to put others at ease. Even now, you bravely stand before me to protect the prince.\u201d\nMary\u2019s eyes were wide with confusion. Rishe picked her words carefully, attempting to diminish the girl\u2019s guilty feelings, if only a little. \u201cYou need to marry the prince for your family\u2019s sake, right?\u201d\n\u201cHow do you\u2014?\u201d\nRishe had learned this truth in one of her past lives. Mary was born to a poor family, and she had studied like mad to be accepted into the academy to hunt for a husband. She intended to make sure neither she nor her brothers ever went hungry again.\nShe went on, \u201cRemember this: you are the one in control of your life. Don\u2019t sell it to anyone else. Can you trust a man who so easily discards the woman he\u2019s been engaged to since childhood? Do you truly believe he cares for you?\u201d\nAstonishment bloomed across Mary\u2019s face. She looked over at Dietrich, who hadn\u2019t bothered to stand up. The truth was\u2026within a year, Prince Dietrich would be in prison, his title stripped from him. He would plan a mad coup d\u2019\u00e9tat against the king, attempting to provoke the citizens to war. His plan would be discovered in its early stages, rendering him a laughingstock across the kingdom.\n\u201cYou must shape your future with your own hands\u2014you mustn\u2019t entrust your desires to others",
    "query_text": ".\u201d \n\u201cMy\u2026my desires?\nRishe nodded.\nMary was looking at her like she was speaking a foreign language. \u201cBut I\u2019m their elder sister.\u201d Her voice quivered. \u201cI must endure, no matter what. Otherwise, my brothers will never be happy.\u201d\n\u201cAnd you believe their happiness can only be achieved by sacrificing your own?\u201d\nMary gasped as she gaped at Rishe.\n\u201cYou don\u2019t need to throw away your own future to protect those you love,\u201d Rishe told her. \u201cNo matter what path you choose, never forget that.\u201d\n\u201cMy future?\u201d Mary\u2019s voice went ragged, like she was barely suppressing a wail of pain.\n\u201cI wish you a life where both you and your family can be happy,\u201d said Rishe.\nMary stood frozen in place, eyes gleaming like precious stones. Rishe couldn\u2019t help but admire how pretty she was. She truly did wish her happiness. But right now, she needed to take"

Just as she became a full-fledged knight, Emperor Arnold\u2019s forces lay siege to the castle.\n \n***\n \nHow could this happen? \nIn her seventh life, Rishe wearily sank into her chair. Across from her sat Arnold, his legs crossed and chin propped up on his hand, watching her lazily.\n\u201cWhat\u2019s the matter?\u201d he asked. \u201cYou seem unhappy.\u201d\n\u201cYou could say that.\u201d Even her voice was grumpy. Still, she couldn\u2019t very well tell him it was because she bore a grudge from a previous life. After the first time her life rewound to that pivotal moment, she\u2019d resolved to keep her loops a secret. \u201cI had plans for my exile. A brand-new life. And now because of you, my parents are involved. Even the king has heard about it!\u201d\nAfter Rishe rejected Arnold, Dietrich had immediately cried out, \u201cTh-the crown prince of Galkhein proposed to Rishe?!\u201d\nHis shrieks were loud enough to attract the attention of the master and mistress of the manor.\nWhen her parents came out, Rishe had protested, \u201cI\u2019m not going to marry him! I\u2019m leaving the country just as Dietrich commanded.\u201d\nNo one listened. Their faces just paled with nervous confusion.\nJust then, a glittering coach arrived. Half-stuck in the mud, the man inside it was forced to trudge over the swampy ground, and so the king of Hermity himself arrived, staggering and dirt-stained. \nHe grabbed hold of his son\u2019s collar, pushing him into a low bow. He then turned to Prince Arnold and said, rather loudly, \u201cYour Highness! Allow me to apologize for my son\u2019s foolishness! You are an esteemed guest all the way from Galkhein! It is unthinkable he would not offer you the courtesy you are due!\u201d\n\u201cYou\u2019re hurting me, Father! My back!\u201d\nThe king then turned to Rishe. \u201cMy lady, allow me to sincerely apologize as both a king and a father. My son\u2019s behavior toward you has been utterly disgraceful. I beg you to please give Prince Arnold\u2019s proposal due consideration. Not only for your own sake but for the sake of your country.\u201d\nThe king bowed to her as deeply as his son had to Arnold, and her parents joined him. Rishe felt dizzy at the sight of this abject debasement in the presence of citizens.\nArnold, who had been watching the proceedings with a detached amusement, sobered and stepped toward the king. \u201cYour Majesty, please rise.\u201d\nWithout the smirk, Arnold\u2019s face immediately reverted to its cold mask. The king didn\u2019t move. Maybe something in Arnold\u2019s voice kept him frozen.\n\u201cSuch a trifle won\u2019t cause discord between our kingdoms,\u201d he went on. \u201cHowever, I would beg a little time to speak with Lady Rishe.\u201d\nLater, Rishe would learn that Arnold\u2019s attendant had spoken to the king\u2019s own gentleman, certain that his words would reach their target. \u201cMy master took such trouble to attend these festivities, and this is the welcome he is offered? I wonder, what will the emperor think when he learns of his son\u2019s slighting at your nation\u2019s hands?\u201d\n\u201cIf you would, Lady Rishe?\u201d The plump king looked to be on the verge of tears.\nRishe had no obligation to accept and no desire to spend a moment longer in this country than was absolutely necessary. But acquiescence seemed the fastest way to move things along.\nAs her mind whirled, Arnold leaned in to whisper, \u201cIf you refuse to hear my suit, you won\u2019t deter me. I\u2019ll simply move on to Plan B.\u201d\nAnd that was how she found herself in one of the palace\u2019s parlors, here to \u201cjust talk\u201d to Prince Arnold. The ball guests were all gone. It was just the two of them.\n\u201cI want to know what you\u2019re planning,\u201d Rishe said flatly.\n\u201cPlanning? Me?\u201d\n\u201cBy asking me to marry you. You don\u2019t know me. A proposal like this wouldn\u2019t come out of the blue.\u201d\nThis man was destined to become an aggressive warmonger over the next few years. He wouldn\u2019t do anything without a dozen motives.\nPrince Arnold just smiled. \u201cI have no plans. I\u2019m simply enamored with you.\u201d\n\u201cEnamored\u2026?\u201d\nThat was the last thing she\u2019d expected him to say. Asking him to elaborate didn\u2019t seem worth the breath\u2014he was obviously lying. As if this ruthless, inhuman creature with ice in his veins could feel even a flicker of affection.\n\u201cWhy refuse me?\u201d Arnold asked. \u201cYour engagement is broken, you\u2019re on the verge of exile, and you have no faction or supporters. At this rate, you\u2019ll be dead within a fortnight. I\u2019d call my offer a stroke of unbelievable fortune.\u201d\n\u201cYou\u2019re not wrong,\u201d Rishe admitted. \u201cOnce upon a time, I would have jumped at your offer.\u201d\nIf it had been made in her first life, for instance. But now Rishe knew better. Her life was only just getting started, and the future held endless possibilities. After the horror of her sixth loop, she yearned for freedom.\nI don\u2019t want to marry him. I won\u2019t be anyone\u2019s captive. Still\u2026\nRishe, more than anyone, knew that the slightest adjustment could enact profound changes on the trajectory of a life. No doubt she\u2019d have many more lives, but this could be the only one where marriage to Arnold would be an option.\nThe dread emperor. The tyrant. The man who will stoke the fires of war. \nRishe knew the gossip, the endless conjecture behind Arnold Hein\u2019s bloody reign, but she didn\u2019t know the truth.\nWhy? The question had haunted her since her first life. She\u2019d never before had the chance to even speak to him.\nShe had wondered it as a merchant, hearing of the distant outbreak of war. She\u2019d wondered when the news of the dead and dying reached her apothecary. When she had comforted her terrified mistress in her life as a maid, assuring her everything would be all right. When she squared off against him in battle, as he plunged a sword through her heart\u2014even then she wondered. \nIf I stick around, maybe I\u2019ll finally have my answer. Half of her was dying to know. The other half didn\u2019t give a damn. And yet\u2026\nShe recalled a childhood dream. Rather, a longing.\nRishe let out a breath. \u201cYou claim you are enamored with me.\u201d\n\u201cYes. I am completely under your spell.\u201d\nTo think he could spout such nonsense with a straight face!\n\u201cThen will you grant me anything I desire?\u201d\n\u201cSo long as it is within my power,\u201d Arnold said. \u201cAnything you want will be yours.\u201d\nRishe hesitated, gathering her thoughts. \u201cI have some conditions.\u201d Arnold silently motioned for her to go on. \u201cI want full control over the wedding festivities. Everything must be procured through merchants of my choosing.\u201d\n\u201cFine.\u201d Arnold nodded. \u201cYou\u2019re free to do business with whomever you wish.\u201d\n\u201cAfter we are married, I must be in a position to mingle with guests from abroad.\u201d\n\u201cThat sounds within the purview of the crown princess. Anything else?\u201d\n\u201cI will be allowed to live in a separate residence from your mother and father.\u201d\nShe meant this seriously, but it made Arnold laugh. \u201cYou don\u2019t seem the type to worry about an overbearing mother-in-law.\u201d\n\u201cYou would be surprised. Combative relationships with one\u2019s new family are the most difficult part of marriage, or so they say. It could be a ramshackle cottage for all I care\u2014I just require a secondary residence.\u201d\nActually, Rishe didn\u2019t care at all about in-laws. When Arnold set his war into motion, his first move would be the assassination of his father. A genuine coup by patricide, not at all like Dietrich\u2019s clumsy attempt. Next, he would name himself emperor, take control of the country, and mobilize the military.\nSeparating him from his parents will make the first step more difficult\u2014although not impossible, unfortunately.\n\u201cAnything else?\u201d Arnold asked. \u201cI\u2019ll do whatever it takes to marry you.\u201d\n\u201cIdeally, I\u2019d like to know your endgame,\u201d Rishe said with dignity. \u201cBut as I doubt there\u2019s any chance of that, I have one final request.\u201d She jabbed a finger into",

I shall be utterly useless.\u201d\nLet\u2019s see just how much you want me as your princess.\nAfter a long moment of silence, Arnold cracked a merry laugh. The proposal remained; all her conditions were met.\n\n(2) chapter number given is likely out of range: 0\nChapter: 7\n\nChapter 2\nChapter 2\n \n\u201cYOU KNOW, it was only after I went into commerce that I truly had a"

    "prefix_text": " as well.\u201d\nThe antidote was synthesized, in fact, when hunters witnessed a deer showing no symptoms after eating a certain mushroom. They tested those along with other common herbs the deer ate. Rishe mentally thanked them for their scientific rigor as she added a bit of water, straining it all through a cloth.\nRishe stood up, brandishing the bowl of bright green medicine. \u201cBoiling would make the antidote more potent, but this works in a pinch.\u201d\nThat was when she noticed the astonished stares. Unsure of what social faux paus she\u2019d perpetrated, she looked away. Oliver was completely stunned. Arnold looked thoughtful. It was imperative the knights were treated as soon as possible, but to Rishe\u2019s dismay, no one was moving. \nDo they not trust me? That makes sense. Anyone would be reluctant to use medicine concocted by a complete stranger. But the longer we wait, the harder the poison will become to cure. \nShe needed to dispel their doubts. Rolling up her sleeve, Rishe approached Arnold and drew his sword from its scabbard. \u201cI need to borrow this for a moment, Your Highness.\u201d\n\u201cWhat are you\u2014\u201d\nShe pushed the blade against the soft skin of her inner arm. Blood welled up, along with the sharp sting of pain. Nothing compared to her injuries sustained during her life as a knight, though.\nArnold did not share her nonchalance. \u201cWhat do you think you\u2019re doing?!\u201d\nHe grabbed for her arm. She stepped out of his grasp. Was blood truly so shocking? She didn\u2019t have the time to worry about it. Clutching the overfull bowl, Rishe hurried back to the knights.\n\u201cDon\u2019t worry. This isn\u2019t poison,\u201d Rishe said. She demonstrated as much by drizzling it with a spoon over her own fresh wound. It stung. That meant the ingredients were working.\n\u201cThis is crushed liquori grass, luqua flowers, and carilya nuts. I\u2019ll swallow some if that\u2019s what it takes to prove it\u2019s safe.\u201d It was horribly bitter; she hoped it wouldn\u2019t come to that. \u201cThe paralysis will last for days. Please make up your mind quickly.\u201d\n\u201cMake up our mind?\u201d\n\u201cWill you allow me to cure the poison? Or would you rather drag paralyzed soldiers all the way to Galkhein? I suppose you could waste His Highness\u2019s time searching for a hunter\u2019s settlement to use their antidote.\u201d She smiled serenely. \u201cIt makes no difference to us. Right, Your Highness?\u201d\nIn the end, Rishe applied the antidote.\nThe recovery took a few hours. While they waited, Rishe picked herbs in the same meadow she\u2019d been gazing at with yearning from the carriage. A fortuitous turn of events. She found anti-inflammatory herbs and flowers to ease sour bellies, ingredients for curing headaches, and mushrooms for inducing slumber. She wrapped them all up in a handkerchief.\nIn the meantime, Arnold dispatched a messenger to this region\u2019s lord, making arrangements to deliver the apprehended bandits. After coordinating with Oliver, he drifted over to Rishe.\n\u201cI see your interest in flowers is mercenary, rather than ornamental,\u201d he said, surveying the heaps of herbs gathered on the bank of the pond. He sat down beside her.\nWhen he didn\u2019t say anything more, Rishe went back to work plucking leaves from plants with valuable stems. The leaves had no medicinal effects, but they did make a decent broth. Slumber mushroom spores were a nuisance unless dried; they were spread out beside her in the sun.\nI wonder, would he be annoyed if I attached herbs to the roof of the coach? That would be unusual adornment for a crown prince\u2019s retinue, but it wouldn\u2019t hurt to ask.\nShe realized, quite suddenly, that Arnold was looking at her. At her hands, specifically. He sat cross-legged with his chin propped on his fist, staring absently, like a kid watching a column of ants march by.\nWhat is so fascinating about herbs?\nTheir eyes met. \u201cAm I bothering you?\u201d he asked.\nRishe shook her head slowly. \u201cNot at all. I was just curious what caught your eye.\u201d\n\u201cNothing specific. I was just thinking how very unusual you are.\u201d He was smiling again. \u201cI\u2019m looking forward to how you\u2019ll surprise me next.\u201d\nLike I\u2019m some sort of rare pet he bought to entertain him. She didn\u2019t like that. Nothing she\u2019d done was at all remarkable\u2014normal tasks performed by a normal person.\n\u201cI didn\u2019t make that antidote for your amusement.\u201d\n\u201cI realize that.\u201d The instigating smile faded from his lips. \u201cYou know, those knights you coerced into taking your home-brewed medicine were all born in the slums.\u201d\n\u201cCoerced? That\u2019s hardly the word I\u2019d use.\u201d\n\u201cGalkhein claims to value merit above all else, but in the end, people are judged by where they came from. Despite this, those men fought their way up from nothing.\u201d\nRishe paused in plucking the seeds from a flower and looked up at Arnold.\n\u201cThe men with the worst cases of the paralysis were all newly assigned. They\u2019ve spent weeks training to ensure this mission was a success. That older knight\u2014the one who bowed to you\u2014sustained an injury protecting the rookies. He cares deeply about his men.\u201d\n\u201cYou seem to care about them too,\u201d Rishe commented.\n\u201cI handpicked them for my retinue.\u201d Arnold clambered to his feet, only to fall into a bow. \u201cAnd you kept them safe. You have my deepest gratitude.\u201d\nRishe found herself at a loss for words. Was this Arnold putting on a mask to hide the monster within? Or was this the real him? She remembered the way he\u2019d looked when he held his blade to the bandit\u2019s throat, like a child poised to break a toy he had grown bored of.\n\u201cDon\u2019t mention it,\u201d Rishe said, uncomfortable. \u201cI knew how to do it, so I did.\u201d\nArnold laughed softly. \u201cBe that as it may, I\u2019d still count a noblewoman who can brew remedies from wildflowers by the side of the road a rare find.\u201d\n\u201cEarlier, when you grabbed my wrist\u2026\u201d Rishe steered the subject away from her incongruous knowledge. \u201cYou broke your promise. You said you wouldn\u2019t touch me.\u201d\n\u201cThat was reflex,\u201d Arnold protested. \u201cI thought you were going to hurt yourself.\u201d\nSuch a simple conversation, so casual. It had Rishe feeling positively peculiar.\n\u201cWhy are your knights so wary around me?\u201d she asked. \n\u201cWary? Oh, they were all at the palace when you broke your first engagement. They\u2019re most likely concerned I\u2019m bringing home a villainous jilt who will lead to my ruin. Something silly like that.\u201d\n\u201cI see.\u201d Apparently, being dumped by a prince called into question one\u2019s herbalist abilities.\n\u201cI\u2019m glad you mentioned it,\u201d Arnold went on, \u201cbecause there may be people in Galkhein who will oppose our union. I will do everything in my power to protect you, but you must bring any insults or threats to me right away.\u201d\n\u201cAre there likely to be many?\u201d\n\u201cIn theory, the crown prince may choose his own wife, but the done thing is, of course, to marry a princess. I assume a duke\u2019s daughter would have at least some ties to the royal family?\u201d\nHe assumed correctly. She was in the family tree, if a rather distant branch.\n\u201cMy father has ordered me to choose a bride from a different kingdom rather than a woman of my own land because\u2014\u201d\n\u201cOne never knows when a hostage will come in handy,\u201d Rishe finished for him.\nGalkhein was an expansionist empire. Currently, peace reigned\u2014but peace was precarious. If Galkhein demanded any of the countries to hand over a princess bride, then none were in a position to refuse. With his daughter in the hands of a foreign power, no king would dare oppose a war that power cared to wage.\n\u201cI sent a message to my father telling him I happened upon a close relation of Hermity\u2019s king\u2014a duke\u2019s daughter who had been recently tossed aside by her fianc\u00e9e,\u201d Arnold said. \u201cI also may have implied I was the reason for your falling out\u2014yours and the prince\u2019s. Why, when I saw a woman so powerful and connected and beloved, I couldn\u2019t help but plunder you.\u201d\n\u201cPlunder me? That\u2019s certainly one way to describe it.\u201d Dietrich had kicked up an almighty fuss, despite being the one who broke the engagement.\n\u201cMy father approves of you because he sees you as a bargaining chip. There will be others who aren\u2019t prepared to accept you so willingly.\u201d\n\u201cIs that so?\u201d Rishe said steadily.\n\u201cNever fear,\u201d Arnold responded. \u201cThey\u2019ll eat their words, every one of them. They will receive you as their crown princess if they value their\u2014\u201d\n\u201cNo, being a hostage is perfect.\u201d \nArnold stared at her. \u201cHm?\u201d\n\u201cAs a hostage, I\u2019ll have no official duties, will I? We can pretend I\u2019m here only under great duress, and there will be no need for my comment on governmental or diplomatic affairs.\u201d\nArnold hesitated. \u201cI suppose not.\u201d\n\u201cExcellent! Then I can live my dream of being utterly useless.\u201d Rishe trembled with delight. The thought of acting as an ambassador had really been weighing on her mind. Being a princess was nonstop work. Having been groomed for the position from an early age, Rishe knew members of the royal family barely even had time to sleep.\nBut prisoners didn\u2019t have places in government.\n\u201cThis is such a weight off my mind,\u201d Rishe admitted. \u201cThank you so much for keeping your promise, Your Highness.\u201d\n\u201cEr, of course.\u201d\n\u201cBut don\u2019t worry, I won\u2019t shirk my duties as wedding planner.\u201d Nearly ready to collapse with relief, Rishe returned to her herbs.\n \n***\n \nAfter the bandit incident, Rishe felt the knights begin to ease a bit in her presence.\nDespite their initial reluctance to accept her help, they continued to report the injured men\u2019s progress and bring any concerns directly to her. In return, they took over gathering herbs from the surrounding countryside on their rest stops.\nShe hadn\u2019t done it for gratitude, but she was nonetheless touched. Gathering medicinal herbs had been second nature ever since her life as an apothecary, and it was foolish to ever turn down loyalty.\nSeveral days after the altercation with the bandits, the coach train finally arrived in the imperial capital of Galkhein.\n\u201cOh my,\u201d Rishe murmured as they passed through the gates.\nWhite stone buildings stood in straight rows, lining clean, orderly streets. The first stories all appeared to be shops, while the second-floor windows were festooned with flowers. Everywhere she looked were smiling faces, citizens turned out to witness their prince\u2019s return over the smooth brick roads. Overlooking it all was the towering magnificence of the imperial palace.\n\u201cThe capital is the seat of power in Galkhein,\u201d Arnold explained. \u201cSeveral key trade routes converge here.\u201d\nRishe nodded, suddenly anxious to be out of the coach. More and more people were gathering to watch their progress, some carrying shopping bags in both arms or holding hands with children. Many of them waved, as if greeting someone dear to them.\nHappy citizens and clean, orderly streets meant wealth. Galkhein was well-off. Rishe couldn\u2019t help but grin at an adorable little girl watching them roll by with sparkling eyes. When she saw Rishe\u2019s smile, she blushed and leapt up in the air, laughing with delight.\nThe coach made its way through the city before passing through the castle gates. Lines of disciplined knights flanked the road, ready to greet the crown prince and his fianc\u00e9e.\nArnold stepped out of the coach, holding out his hand to Rishe. She took it reflexively as she alighted. A prince would be expected to help any lady out of carriage, never mind his own consort, yet for some reason the knights looked a bit disturbed.\nRishe shot them back of look of innocent confusion.\n\u201cOur long journey is at last at its end, Your Highness, Lady Rishe.\u201d Oliver emerged from the ranks of the knights, bowing. He shot Arnold a curious glance. \u201cHow novel to see you taking the hand of your fianc\u00e9e.\u201d\nAh! Rishe realized that she herself had willingly broken the condition that she had imposed. Arnold had offered his hand, but she was the one who accepted.\nArnold gave a little laugh of triumph. Rishe felt a rush of frustration at being tricked. \nOliver stared at them before leaning in to whisper in Arnold\u2019s ear. Arnold let out a breath of annoyance. \n\u201cIs something the matter?\u201d Rishe asked.\n\u201cI sent orders ahead to have a detached wing of the palace prepared for us, but it seems the preparations are behind schedule. I\u2019m sorry, but you\u2019ll need to stay in a guest room in the main palace for a few days.\u201d\n\u201cOh, I don\u2019t mind if the wing isn\u2019t ready,\u201d Rishe said. \u201cWe can head over there now.\u201d\n\u201cIt hasn\u2019t been used in quite a while. It\u2019ll be covered in dust.\u201d\n\u201cI said that I didn\u2019t mind if it was a mess, remember? But there\u2019s no need for you to put yourself out. By all means, stay in the main palace for as long as you need.\u201d Rishe had spent a life as a maid\u2014dust didn\u2019t scare her. \u201cBesides, I\u2019m a hostage, after all.\u201d\n\u201cYou could at least attempt to sound distressed,\u201d Arnold said with the slightest trace of petulance. \nRishe, who had a huge grin spreading over her face and her chest puffed out with pride, didn\u2019t respond.\n \n***\n \nThe detached wing turned out to be just a separate palace in the distant corner of the grounds\u2014a scant four stories tall and, as advertised, absolutely swimming in dust.\nNot so bad, though. Rishe had pictured decay and clutter, but it was mostly just bare. Bare and musty, but not rotten or falling apart.\n\u201cYou can do whatever you want with this place. I\u2019ll be occupied over the next few days, but feel free to use the guest apartments in the main palace if you get tired of choking to death,\u201d Arnold said before he left.\nAccording to Oliver, work had piled up while the prince was away, and it wasn\u2019t just a few things that could be dispensed with over a few days working around the clock.\nEmperor Arnold Hein\u2026 He\u2019s just a crown prince right now, but I still wish I knew what\u2019s going on in his head. For now, I\u2019ll just focus on what I can do. Like make this place livable.\nShe changed into her plainest dress and rolled up her sleeves. The knights who\u2019d remained to serve as her guard kept watch over her as she went from window to window, throwing them all open.\nIn a stroke of luck, the weather was good, and the detached wing was well placed to soak up the sun. The lack of any creature comforts made it look ascetic and drab, but once it was furnished, Rishe had no doubt it would be lovely.\nLeaving the top floors to air out, Rishe found the stairs to the basement. She pushed the heavy wooden doors open, and mice skittered over her feet. The knights yelped as Rishe descended into the darkness.\n\u201cL-Lady Rishe, why are you going down here?\u201d\n\u201cCleaning supplies are usually kept in the basement. See?\u201d\nThe knights followed her gaze to a duster, broom, dustpan, and pile of fresh cloths. She filled a bucket with water and went to work, rolling up a handkerchief to cover her mouth as she swept dust down from high on the walls. Then she swept up all the dust on the floor.\nIt\u2019s always satisfying to tackle a place this filthy.\nShe corralled the dust bunnies until they were piled up like snow in the center of the hall, and then she swept them out the open door. Once the floors were free of debris, she attacked them with the cloth.\n\u201cLady Rishe, is there anything we can do to help?\nRishe was grateful for the knight\u2019s offer, but she shook her head. \u201cYour job is to guard me, not do my housekeeping.\u201d\n\u201cThis is quite the place to clean on your own, detached though it may be,\u201d the knight said hesitantly. \u201cIt\u2019s not too late to move into the guest chambers instead.\u201d\n\u201cThat\u2019s all right. I like the place already.\u201d\nRishe remained steadfast in her refusal for one reason: readying guest chambers was an awful chore. The palace maids would be expected to work overnight to prepare them, even if the guests were only staying a single night. No speck of dust or strand of hair could remain. Certainly no wrinkled sheets. Rishe knew how exhausting and rigorous a maid\u2019s job was, how nerve-racking.\nShe refused to put the poor dears through such an ordeal for just a few days\u2019 stay. From the sound of things, the palace wasn\u2019t equipped with many housemaids. No doubt they already had their hands full.\n\u201cBesides, take a look.\u201d She held out her arms wide, gesturing to her sparkling clean floor. The knights stared at the bright room in admiration. \u201cCleaning a place with your own hands makes living there that much more satisfying, you see.\u201d\nThe knights smiled their awkward but good-natured agreement.\nRishe worked tirelessly, and before long, the chambers where she would spend the night were ready. The knights offered to carry in the bed, which she allowed.\nWhile they brought in furniture, Rishe started cleaning another room. She had run out of clean water, so she quietly slipped out to the well without informing the knights. It wasn\u2019t quite fair to them, but these were the palace grounds. Surely she didn\u2019t need to be chaperoned everywhere.\nBesides, they\u2019re guards in name only. They\u2019re clearly just here to report my movements to Arnold Hein, Rishe reflected as she walked through a courtyard full of flowers, bucket in hand. Iridescent butterflies cavorted playfully around her feet. He doesn\u2019t seem in a hurry to introduce me to the king. Although if I\u2019m just a hostage,",
    "query_text": " that doesn\u2019t surprise me.\nShe hoped she got to meet the current emperor at least once. The future Arnold\u2019s violent conquest only began after he killed the man and made himself emperor, after all.\nI wonder what happened to Arnold Hein after I died in my past life. Did he reign supreme after winning his war? Or did some country manage to put a stop to his conquest? Whatever the case, I absolutely cannot allow him to start a conflict this time. Being the empress of a wartime nation sounds like so much work! The very thought is unacceptable!\nPerhaps they could divorce, but Rishe had a feeling that if Arnold decided to discard her in the middle of a war, she would fail in her mission to make it past the age of twenty. Better to avoid the situation all together.\nWait. When she thought about"

Her face remained vacant, but she seemed sad. \u201cAnd I just got it.\u201d \n\u201cYou can get the dirt out if you wash it straight away. It\u2019s going to rain, but this dress should dry quickly. Use lots of soap, but don\u2019t scrub it by hand\u2014scrape the mud off with a brush.\u201d\n\u201cWhy a brush?\u201d\n\u201cBecause your fingers will just grind dirt into the threads. A brush is more porous.\u201d\nThe young sons of the family Rishe served spent their time tumbling in the dirt, and she had plenty of experience scraping mud out of clothes. She could even salvage dirty socks that had spent days crumpled in the corner.\n\u201cDo you\u2026 Are you\u2026\u201d Elsie trailed off, blinking rapidly a couple of times before finally looking Rishe in the eyes. \u201cAre you the crown princess\u2019s maid?\u201d\nUnsure how to answer, Rishe couldn\u2019t meet her eyes.\n \n***\n \nAfter parting ways with Elsie, Rishe returned to the detached wing with her fresh water. She put clean sheets on the bed the knights had installed, satisfied that she had a comfortable place to sleep. This room also had the highest-up balcony in the whole detached palace.\nTaking a break, she wandered out onto the balcony and looked off over the capital, the golden afternoon tinged with the onset of twilight. The day was fresh with a recent rain, the air clear enough to see for miles. The spring breeze felt good against her skin, sweaty from cleaning. Rishe leaned against the railing, leaning her head back and closing her eyes.\nShe felt like collapsing into bed immediately, but she desperately needed a wash. Still, she didn\u2019t want to pull herself away from the view and the breeze just yet. When she resumed gazing out absentmindedly, something her mother once said drifted back to her. \n\u201cRishe, there is no need for you to think for yourself.\u201d\nShe frowned, the memories coming thick and fast now.\n\u201cYou mustn\u2019t forget that the duty of our family is to live our lives fully devoted to the kings of the land. You\u2019re smart, but all the thinking in the world won\u2019t do a woman any good. You need only concern yourself with how best to serve the crown prince.\u201d\n\u201cStudies? Focus on social etiquette\u2014that\u2019s what you need for navigating high society. The crown prince\u2019s bride must be flawless. Your smile is lacking. You must always strive to appear amiable.\u201d\nRishe breathed out a long sigh. When I was fifteen, their lectures were the only thing I thought about.\nHer parents preached constantly. \u201cA woman\u2019s true happiness is to marry a suitable man and give birth to his heirs.\u201d\n\u201cBut, Mother\u2026\u201d\nObjection was not permitted. Any argument was immediately dispensed with. As a woman, Rishe could not inherit her father\u2019s title. Her only value was in her marriage. \nDespite knowing now that the opinions of others were as worthless as empty titles, the words still echoed in her memories.\nRishe\u2019s fingertips twitched, and she opened her eyes. Unmoving, she said, \u201cShouldn\u2019t you be seeing to your duties?\u201d\n\u201cMore hidden depths, I see,\u201d came a voice tinged with pleasure. Rishe straightened and turned. There was Arnold, leaning against the door to the balcony. \u201cYou seem able to sense my approach no matter how far or how hard I try.\u201d\n\u201cYou\u2019re quite naughty, aren\u2019t you? You\u2019ve been making your presence known little by little, emanating threat, to see how quickly I catch on.\u201d\n\u201cSo you noticed that as well.\u201d Arnold joined Rishe on the balcony. She tensed, but all he did was cast a curious glance at the view. \u201cWhat were you looking at?\u201d\n\u201cThe city.\u201d Rishe was hardly going to tell him she\u2019d been looking at nothing, merely ruminating on her mother\u2019s overbearing advice. The view from the balcony was spectacular, though. \u201cWhat\u2019s that over there?\u201d\n\u201cYou mean the library? The state invested funds to expand it. We have books from all over the world.\u201d\n\u201cReally? You have a library that big?\u201d Rishe\u2019s eyes sparkled with delight. She pointed out another building. \u201cWhat about that spire? It\u2019s beautiful.\u201d\n\u201cThe church and clock tower. The bells ring out the hour.\u201d\n\u201cOoh, how wonderful! And it looks like there\u2019s a rather big market there too?\u201d\n\u201cYes, the largest market in the city. Carts line up in the early morning. Most of the offerings are made fresh every day.\u201d\n\u201cAmazing! And what about that pretty mountain over there?\u201d\nRishe tried and failed to contain her excitement. She couldn\u2019t help but imagine what seeing all these places up close would be like. The grand library, the beautiful church that told the time, and the morning market with fresh, delicious food\u2014she wanted to experience it all.\nSeeing Arnold\u2019s bemused face, she said, \u201cWhat?\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m just wondering where all this interest is coming from,\u201d he said. \u201cYou were so reluctant to come, yet here you are, brimming with curiosity for my city.\u201d\n\u201cWell\u2026\u201d she trailed off, unsure of how to respond.\nWhat should I say? Should I just tell him the truth?\nThis wasn\u2019t a secret, but talking about her hopes and dreams to the man who had killed her was a little awkward. A strange self-consciousness settled on her, her cheeks heating as she mumbled, \u201cBecause I\u2019ve always wanted to.\u201d\nArnold looked at her keenly. \u201cWanted to what?\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019ve always wanted to come here.\u201d\nDuring her life as a merchant, Rishe developed her single dream to visit everywhere in the world. That dream was cut tragically short when only one country remained: Galkhein.\nIn each of her consecutive lives, Rishe\u2019s priority became staying alive. Every time, without fail, just as she found her footing, the world was plunged into chaos. She never had the chance to see Galkhein. This betrothal was her chance. \u201cIt\u2019s probably why I agreed to marry you,\u201d she added after a moment\u2019s hesitation.\nArnold swept a tepid glance over the city. \u201cThere\u2019s nothing here worth seeing.\u201d\n\u201cThat\u2019s not true! The places you just told me about sound amazing! Your citizens are clean and happy, your knights are proper and kind. Oh, and another\u2014\u201d \nRishe broke off enumerating Galkhein\u2019s charms as Arnold turned to look at her. His face was impassively calm, but something seemed to pass by underneath, like a shadow in deep water.\n\u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d Rishe said. \u201cDid I say something odd?\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m just amazed you could be so unaware of yourself.\u201d \nWh-what a rude thing to\u2014\n\u201cI\u2019ve never met anyone like you. No one has ever spoken to me the way you do. I don\u2019t know any girls of your class with the knowledge or the physical abilities you possess. Noblewomen don\u2019t concern themselves with such things.\u201d\nRishe, there is no need for you to think for yourself.\nShe frowned. \u201cPerhaps you\u2019re right, but everything I\u2019ve learned is precious to me. No one can take my skills away\u2014I value them with my life. Some may say that my knowledge is worthless, but it makes no difference to me.\u201d She turned from the balcony, fixing him with a piercing gaze. \u201cI\u2019m the one who decides what I value.\u201d\nRishe had clawed free of her mother and father\u2019s indoctrination a long time ago. Man, woman\u2014it didn\u2019t matter. She could do anything. Being queen was not the culmination of her life; she wouldn\u2019t trade her freedom for anything.\nArnold matched her intensity. \u201cYou\u2019re right.\u201d He gently cupped her cheek in a one hand, swiping his thumb along the line of her jaw, smearing dust. \u201cLive your life here however you wish. I vow to do my utmost to protect you.\u201d\n\u201cHuh?\u201d\nHis vehemence took her by surprise. Arnold had every right to demand she act the part of a proper consort. This was a political marriage; Rishe was essentially a hostage, after all. Yet here he was, cosigning her misbehavior. Moreover, he was all but swearing to defend her from the consequences.\n\u201cWhy?\u201d\n\u201cYou know why. I\u2019m enamored with you.\u201d Arnold fed her the same line. \u201cI know you said you don\u2019t care about other people\u2019s approval, but I like your asymmetrical talents. I don\u2019t find them useless at all.\u201d \nRishe didn\u2019t know how to respond.\n\u201cI thought I\u2019d already made that clear.\u201d He took his hand back, drawing away, stopping just on the threshold. He turned back to a stunned Rishe and said, \u201cLet me know if there\u2019s anything you desire. I realize I just broke our agreement\u2014the one about not touching you.\u201d\nAnd with that, he was gone.\nShaken, Rishe sank to the floor of the balcony. I can\u2019t predict him at all! Just what is Arnold Hein planning?\nThe quiet of evening fell over the imperial capital of Galkhein.\n \n***\n \n\u201cMmm.\u201d\nSunshine streamed through the window as Rishe roused from sleep. She rolled over, basking in the morning light. The wall she expected wasn\u2019t there, and the bed seemed larger than usual. Taking advantage of it, she stretched out as far as she could.\nWas this her chamber at home? Or maybe she was a merchant again, spending a night at the desert king\u2019s palace. Perhaps this was her bed of straw from her life as a maid? Her memories met and interwove as she drifted into wakefulness.\nWhen Rishe finally opened her eyes, she grew even more confused.\nLight blue curtains surrounded the bed, thin enough to allow sunlight to pass through. She pulled them aside to find herself in a bare room devoid of furniture and carpet.\nOh, right. She didn\u2019t need to report for morning training, tend to her herb garden, prepare breakfast, or see how the bottles she had brewed overnight were coming along.\nRealizing that, Rishe buried her face in the pillow. \u201cSo soft,\u201d she murmured. \nJudging by the position of the sun, it was about six o\u2019clock in the morning. She was pretty sure she had gone to bed around midnight last night.\nI slept for six whole hours? Rishe couldn\u2019t believe it. Generally, she was used to getting about four hours of sleep. On bad days, at the height of an emergency as a knight or apothecary, she wouldn\u2019t even get that much. \nI\u2019ve got nothing but cleaning on the schedule today. Hostages can sleep in, right? At least a little? Excitement suffused her at the thought, but that was interrupted by a knock on the door.\n\u201cLady Rishe, are you awake? It\u2019s Oliver\u2014Prince Arnold\u2019s attendant.\u201d\nRishe sat up with a start. \u201cI\u2019m awake!\u201d\nOliver continued to speak through the door. \u201cI apologize for bothering you at such an early hour. I\u2019m here with a delivery.\u201d\n\u201cJust a moment!\u201d Rishe slipped out of the bed, dressed quickly, and tugged the bed\u2019s canopy closed. She opened the door to find Oliver standing in the hallway with a polite smile.\nHe apologized again. \u201cThis was the only time I could slip away from His Highness\u2019s office. I\u2019m glad to see that you\u2019re already dressed.\u201d\n\u201cNot at all.\u201d Rishe paused, stepping back to allow him inside. \u201cOh my. You look exhausted.\u201d\nOliver grimaced. \u201cIs it that obvious? We\u2019ve been climbing through mountains of paperwork, but never mind me. His Highness has been working around the clock.\u201d\nRishe thought back to yesterday, how he had come all the way out to the balcony. He should have used that spare time to sleep. \u201cHe\u2019s in high demand, isn\u2019t he? He was even working on the trip over.\u201d\n\u201cHe finished all the work he brought along with us,\u201d Oliver confirmed. \u201cNow he\u2019s dealing with everything that piled up during his visit to Hermity.\u201d\n\u201cOh.\u201d Rishe grimaced in sympathy. He may have killed her in a past life, but she wouldn\u2019t wish the bureaucracy of kingship on anyone. \u201cIt\u2019s a shame he had to put his work on hold to attend a silly engagement party.\u201d\n\u201cNo matter. That party was how a committed bachelor finally found a bride.\u201d\nHis smile was sincere, but Rishe knew better. She spread her arms. \u201cGo on. Shall I spin around so you have a better view?\u201d",
    "query_text": "\nOliver blinked. \u201cI beg your pardon?\u201d\n\u201cYou\u2019re looking me over like I\u2019m a horse for sale. If there\u2019s anything I can help you with, please let me know.\u201d\nOliver\u2019s brows went up. He let out a little breath of resignation. \u201cHis Highness was right. You do possess the keen perception of a knight. Of course, I\u2019m purely an amateur myself.\u201d\nI\u2019d say this was a merchant\u2019s sixth sense, rather than battle intuition.\nThis wasn\u2019t the first time Rishe had caught Oliver looking at her. It reminded her of the way her noble customers would examine a product, assessing worth and authenticity. Or a merchant weeding out potential merchandise from a wide array of choices.\nIn other words, he was appraising her.\nOliver moved into a deep, sweeping bow. \u201cMy sincerest"

    "prefix_text": " fianc\u00e9e?\u201d\nEvery eye in the ballroom was on Rishe, alight with curiosity, envy, or schemes. None of them could hide their contempt. But Rishe didn\u2019t falter.\nThis is nothing compared to being publicly dumped in a banquet hall. And I\u2019ve done that seven times!\nShe offered a polite smile and an astoundingly correct curtsy. Left leg at a diagonal behind the right, back straight, head bowed. \u201cHow do you do? My name is Rishe Irmgard Weitzner.\u201d\nEven the most hostile guests could find nothing impolite in her greeting, no sign of rough manners from the rustic daughter of a backwater nation. Rishe had years of training in expectation of ascending to the throne. Occasionally, habits from her other lives slipped through, but Arnold appeared to be the only one who noticed.\nNow he was looking at her with satisfaction. \u201cLady Rishe has only just arrived, and her acquaintances are few and far between. I hope I can count on you all to hold me accountable should I prove an incompetent husband.\u201d\n\u201cB-but of course, Your Highness.\u201d\n\u201cCome, Rishe.\u201d Arnold guided her out of the ring of spectators. The stares continued to follow them as they walked away.\nRishe dropped her voice to a whisper. \u201cYou sure know how to invite the ire of women.\u201d\n\u201cWhatever do you mean?\u201d\n\u201cThe way you harped on about me. Everything you said was tailor-made to stoke their jealousy. You\u2019ve gained me enemies, so thanks for that.\u201d\nArnold snorted. \u201cEverything I said was to protect you from enemies. They need to know you aren\u2019t just some trophy they can eliminate without recourse. We need to show them this to forestall any potential moves against you in the future.\n\u201cShow them what, exactly?\u201d\n\u201cThat I\u2019ll protect you no matter what.\u201d\nHe said it with such nonchalance that it brought her up short. Protect me? Arnold Hein, protect me?\nSuch an ironic position to take. She couldn\u2019t tell him that, of course. Her response came out somewhat strangled. \u201cI doubt they\u2019ll be anything to worry about. In fact, the biggest threat facing me is you.\u201d\n\u201cOh? And why do you say that?\u201d\n\u201cFor many reasons, the most obvious being that I\u2019m no match for you with a blade.\u201d As much as it pained her to admit it.\nArnold looked pleased. \u201cPerhaps we should duel.\u201d\n\u201cYes, please! And if it wouldn\u2019t be an intrusion\u2014I would like to train with you.\u201d If she studied him, she could learn his strategies and his attack patterns. She\u2019d never be a match in speed or raw power, but any insight would be invaluable.\n\u201cSure.\u201d Arnold shrugged. \u201cI don\u2019t mind.\u201d\n\u201cTruly?\u201d Her eyes glittered with anticipation.\nHe chuckled. \u201cYour answers never disappoint me.\u201d\n\u201cWhat\u2019s that supposed to mean? Oh, it looks like they\u2019re playing a new song.\u201d\nA soft melody drifted across the hall. The crowd divided, heading toward the center of the floor or against the wall. The next dance was starting, and everyone was waiting to see what the crown prince and his new fianc\u00e9e would do.\n\u201cWe don\u2019t have to dance if you don\u2019t want to,\u201d Arnold said.\n\u201cOh? As it happens, I like dancing.\u201d Plus, she couldn\u2019t resist a blatant challenge. She offered him her hand.\n\u201cVery well, then.\u201d Arnold only hesitated for a moment before taking it and steering her gently to an empty spot on the floor. He didn\u2019t seem like the dancing type, but his movements were slick and effortless. Facing one another, they joined hands. Arnold wrapped his other arm around her waist. \nOoh. His hand felt huge against her back. She realized she was breathing a little faster. They\u2019d never been this close before.\nNo, that isn\u2019t quite true. This is the second time. Rishe\u2019s final memories from her last life flashed vividly through her mind.\nThis was indeed the second time they had been this close\u2014the first had ended with a sword through her chest.\nEmperor Arnold Hein had single-handedly decimated the knights in the castle. Rishe stood in the midst of the carnage, breath ragged as she gripped the hilt of her sword, slick with her own blood. She was the last line of defense. The chamber behind her housed the royal family.\nIf they could reach the hidden passageways, the young prince and his party could find shelter with their allies across the border. Rishe and the other knights were prepared to sacrifice their lives to allow the royal family to survive. Their escape meant victory.\nBells tolled out, urging flight. All is lost. Run. Rishe managed to graze Arnold\u2019s cheek with her blade before she looked down to find his jet-black sword blooming out of her chest.\nShe remembered how it burned, as if the blade was made of fire. It was heat, not pain, but her breathing grew labored, and when Emperor Arnold Hein withdrew his sword, Rishe crumpled. \nHe knelt by her side and whispered something.\nThe words were seared into her memory. Rishe squeezed Arnold\u2019s hand as they danced.\nI\u2019ll be the bully this time. \nRishe shifted her weight back, slipping out of the hold on her waist. She broke Arnold\u2019s lead and spun, drifting on the harmony of the dance. She took him by surprise; his eyes went",

Watching him attempt to follow her lead would be delightful. She pulled his hand toward her, attempting to move them into a spin.\nBut Arnold held fast. He planted his hand on her waist and turned them in a different direction, using her inertia against her. Hey! As a result, Rishe twirled by herself on the spot.\nShe didn\u2019t miss a"

Rishe, the duke\u2019s daughter, bowed in response, her coral-toned hair swaying gracefully. The assembled guests found themselves captivated by her dignified beauty. Despite having just witnessed a broken engagement, they couldn\u2019t bring themselves to pity her.\nSlowly, Rishe lifted her head and fixed the prince with a pale-emerald gaze. It caught him off guard, but he quickly recovered.\n\u201cDidn\u2019t you hear what I just said?! I\u2019m calling off our engagement! Doesn\u2019t that trouble you?\u201d\n\u201cNot really.\u201d\nRishe already knew what happened next: false accusations, exile, and her family severing all ties and leaving her to survive on her own.

She\u2019d made the boy\u2019s life hell since the day she arrived. \nHis brother had prohibited him from attending balls like this one. That was fine; he\u2019d sooner avoid them altogether. Still, he\u2019d wanted to meet that girl. \n\u201cBut we\u2019ll meet soon enough, won\u2019t we?\u201d He spoke to himself in a soft voice. \u201cI\u2019ve got plans for you, Sister.\u201d \n\n(2) chapter number given is likely out of range: 0\nChapter: 8\n\nChapter 3\nChapter 3\n \n\u201cYOU\u2019RE ALL SO USELESS!\u201d Diana the redheaded maid\u2019s voice rang out inside the stone washhouse. \nThree days had passed since the afternoon Rishe shook off her guard and came out to the well. Rishe was once again dressed to fit in with the maids. At Diana\u2019s shout, she looked up without pausing in her work. \n\u201cIs even laundry beyond your capabilities? I asked you to wash these this morning, and now it\u2019s past noon! Meanwhile, we\u2019ve finished cleaning the entire first floor in a third of the time!\u201d\n\u201cI-I\u2019m sorry, Diana.\u201d\nThe new maids went silent with shame. Among them was Elsie, the girl Rishe stood up for the other day. Rishe pulled her hands out of the soapy water, gently rinsed them, and said, \u201cLet me help. What still needs to be done?\u201d\n\u201cYou again?\u201d Diana rounded on Rishe. \u201cI don\u2019t know who you serve, but I\u2019m amazed you have the time to do other people\u2019s work. I wish I had so much free time.\u201d\nHuffily, she turned from Rishe. \u201cLet\u2019s just ignore these useless fools. Laura, Maya. Come on. If we want to be chosen as Lady Rishe\u2019s maids, we mustn\u2019t waste our time.\u201d\nDiana took out a slip of paper from her pocket, smoothing it out. \u201cIt looks like the new bedsheets for her palace will arrive today. We should inspect them to make sure everything is perfect!\u201d\n\u201cWait up, Diana!\u201d\nThe two maids followed Diana out. Rishe waited for the door to close before turning to Elsie and the others. \u201cLet\u2019s keep working. If there\u2019s anything too large and cumbersome, feel free to pass it over to me.\u201d\n\u201cTh-thank you so much!\u201d The new maids went weak with gratitude. One of them, a girl on the verge of tears, even fell into a full bow. Rishe muttered encouragement as she scrubbed some bedsheets.\nElsie, who was washing the sheets with her, wore a rueful look. \u201cI\u2019m so sorry for the trouble. We\u2019re just not learning fast enough.\u201d\n\u201cYou haven\u2019t been working here long, have you? It takes time to learn a new job, no matter who you are,\u201d Rishe said as she kept scrubbing. \u201cAnd it\u2019s not like you\u2019ve never washed a single thing in your life before, right?\u201d\nElsie nodded nervously. \nRishe had realized over the past few days doing the laundry that not all the newcomers were complete amateurs. They\u2019d obviously done chores at home, or something similar. When set a specific task, they could perform it properly, but Diana\u2019s complaints weren\u2019t unfounded. They did take far too much time with laundry.\nBut it\u2019s obvious why. \u201cDo you know anything about Diana?\u201d Rishe asked Elsie. \u201cLike, is she from a well-off family?\u201d\nElsie said, \u201cI heard that her father was a business owner. She worked with him.\u201d\n\u201cI heard that as well,\u201d added another maid. \u201cBut he fell into debt and had to sell off.\u201d \nRishe stopped scrubbing for a moment to consider this.\n\u201cUm, is something the matter?\u201d Elsie asked.\nRishe smiled and shook her head. \u201cNo, nothing. Let\u2019s just focus on getting these washed for the time being.\u201d\n \n***\n \nThat afternoon, thirty maids were assembled in the detached wing of the palace. Ten of them were old hands, long in service to the royal family, while the other twenty were freshly hired. The crown princess was to choose her maids from among these thirty. They wore their nerves plainly on their sleeves. \n\u201cHey, I thought this palace was in a terrible state of neglect,\u201d one maid whispered. \u201cWhy is it so sparkling clean?\u201d\n\u201cYeah, you\u2019re right,\u201d said another. \u201cSomeone must have sorted it out before we arrived.\u201d\n\u201cI wonder what kind of person Lady Rishe is. Ooh, I\u2019m so nervous.\u201d\nThe girls looked around anxiously.\n\u201cHey, Elsie, that girl who was always helping us isn\u2019t here.\u201d\nElsie blinked. \u201cYou\u2019re right.\u201d\n\u201cLook, Diana. That impertinent newbie didn\u2019t get picked.\u201d \nAt her friend\u2019s observation, Diana preened with satisfaction. \u201cNo surprise there. You need some manners to attend to Lady Rishe. I bet she got kicked out of the running!\u201d Her eyes sparkled with confidence.\nAt last, there was a knock at the door.\n\u201cHer Royal Highness, Princess Rishe.\u201d\nThe maids quickly fell into bows. Diana\u2019s chest ached with anticipation as heels clicked on the floor, approaching the line of girls. From the corner of their eyes, the maids saw a wide-skirted court dress. A gentle scent washed over them.\nWithout even looking at her, they could tell Crown Princess Rishe was a lovely woman. Diana and her friends swelled with pride that she was to become their mistress.\nBut then Laura whispered to Diana, \u201cHey, isn\u2019t this scent familiar?\u201d\n\u201cQuiet!\u201d Clearly it was some sort of expensive perfume. Or so Diana thought, but then she realized what it was. The words just slipped out. \u201cIt\u2019s soap.\u201d\n\u201cHuh? Did you just say something?\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s soap. The same kind we always use.\u201d Diana was sure of it.\nThe princess said, \u201cPlease rise.\u201d \nWhy did her voice sound so familiar? An incredible foreboding gripping her, Diana looked up. She gasped.\n\u201cMy name is Rishe Irmgard Weitzner.\u201d\nBefore her stood the beautiful newcomer\u2014the thorn in her side for the past few days. The smile she wore was peaceful and just the slightest bit satisfied.\n \n***\n \nI\u2019m so glad I managed to finish washing the sheets in time!\nStanding before the maids with Arnold\u2019s attendant Oliver at her side, Rishe was panicking on the inside. She\u2019d had so much to do this morning that she\u2019d put off the laundry to the last minute. She took deep, controlled breaths, praying no one would notice that she\u2019d raced here at a dead sprint.\nOliver was none the wiser as he spoke to the assembled girls. Rishe took the opportunity to look them over. She locked eyes with Elsie, who was gaping at her. It was a nice change\u2014usually her face was as blank as a rock wall.\nI\u2019m sorry for the deception. I figured blending in would give me the best picture of your working conditions.\nThe new maids wore similarly shocked expressions, while others watched her with delight. Meanwhile, the veterans, including Diana, had all gone pale. They trembled, stunned into silence. One seemed locked in a terrifying trance, while another looked on the verge of tears. All of them had spoken to Rishe with derision. As the ringleader, Diana was covering her mouth with both hands, like she was holding in a scream.\nOliver had finished his introduction. \u201cYour Highness, if you would?\u201d\nRishe stepped forward. \u201cFirst, I must apologize to you for what has transpired prior to this meeting. My deception, that is. However, it has granted me insight into how each one of you works.\u201d\nOliver\u2019s face creased in confusion. The newcomer maids began to panic, whispering among themselves.\n\u201cDoesn\u2019t this mean that she helped us out with the laundry?\u201d\n\u201cWe\u2019re going to be fired!\u201d\n\u201cIf I lose my position, my brother will have to quit school!\u201d\nNoticing the commotion, Oliver glanced at Rishe. \u201cYour Highness, two-thirds of these maids are newly recruited from the city. Since the majority of the castle maids were elderly, His Highness assumed you would prefer maids closer in age to yourself.\u201d\nRishe was startled. She had found it odd that most of her potential servants were new hires, but she hadn\u2019t expected this to be the reason.\n\u201cWhile the prince has entrusted the selection of your maids to you,\u201d Oliver went on. \u201cHiring someone with no experience will not do. Despite Prince Arnold\u2019s views, I urge you to reject the newcomers.\u201d\n\u201cOliver.\u201d\n\u201cI have a list of their names here. Elsie\u2014\u201d\n\u201cElsie, Nichole, Hilde, Marguerite, Rosa.\u201d Rishe began listing the names of the newly recruited maids. She\u2019d made a point to memorize them in the washhouse. \u201cElke, Amelia, and\u2014\u201d\nOliver looked at her wildly. \u201cYou know them all?! Even though they\u2019ve never served you in the past?\u201d\n\u201cYes, of course I do. Servants are essential to the maintenance of our lifestyle, why wouldn\u2019t I get to know them?\u201d Rishe listed the remaining names for good measure. \u201cAll twenty of you, listen to me.\u201d \nThe new maids stiffened. Diana and the other maids whose names hadn\u2019t been called were getting their wind back, wearing increasingly triumphant looks.\nRishe said, \u201cThe twenty names I just called will be my maids.\u201d\nTime seemed to stand still a moment, and then Oliver broke in with an astonished, \u201cB-but, my lady! They are all inexperienced\u2014\u201d\n\u201cYes. And my palace will be the perfect place to learn.\u201d\nThe new recruits were completely speechless, unsure of exactly what was happening. \nRishe smiled at Elsie. \u201cI hope you\u2019ll serve me well, Elsie.\u201d\nElsie was still frozen in place. \u201cHuh? Y-yes, my lady, but\u2014\u201d\nA shaking Diana cried out, \u201cBut why, my lady?! You\u2019ve seen their work! They\u2019re useless, the lot of them! The rest of us get so much more done in a shorter amount of time!\u201d\n\u201cWatch your tongue, girl,\u201d Oliver said sharply.\nDiana ignored him. \u201cWe\u2019re hard workers! Any job you assign us, we can do it! Please, I beg you, my lady!\u201d\n\u201cStep back,\u201d Oliver warned. \u201cDo not take a single step closer to Lady Rishe.\u201d\nDiana spoke in a rush, words pouring out of her. \u201cI-I freely admit that I was impolite before, but I didn\u2019t know who she was! I\u2019ll take any punishment, so please, give me the chance to show you how well I can work!\u201d\nRishe said, \u201cDiana, I have a request.\u201d\n\u201cTh-thank you, my lady!\u201d Diana heaved a sigh of relief. \u201cYou mean you\u2019ll\u2014\u201d \nRishe cut across her. \u201cAs of today, you are no longer a maid in this palace.\u201d \n\u201cWhat?\u201d Her face, usually so fixed with determination, paled. \u201cBut why? I\u2019m so much better than any of them! I\u2019ll do a perfect job no matter what task you set before me. Please don\u2019t dismiss me, my lady!\u201d \n\u201cListen to me, Diana.\u201d Rishe dropped her lofty tone, speaking as one woman would to another. \u201cYou have noticed it, haven\u2019t you? No matter what you claim, these new girls aren\u2019t worthless.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2026I don\u2019t understand.\u201d\n\u201cCan you remember your first month in service? How difficult it was?\u201d\nDiana looked completely bewildered. Her gaze darted around as if looking for help.\nPulling herself together, she forced herself to follow Rishe\u2019s directions. She thought back and finally alighted on a response. \u201cI\u2026I didn\u2019t know how to do the job. Before, when my family was still prominent, I\u2019d washed shirts and bedsheets. Never gowns or military uniforms.\u201d\n\u201cPerfectly reasonable,\u201d Rishe said. \u201cOnly natural for someone just starting out.\u201d\n\u201cThe older girls were so busy, they told me to just watch them since they didn\u2019t have time to teach me. When I had questions\u2026well, there was nobody to ask.\u201d\n\u201cI bet. And did you have any other problems?\u201d\n\u201cWell, yes. There was a lot to learn. Different kinds of soap and washboards depending on the cloth. You use different tools for different materials. I had to learn how they worked and how to put them away. I was\u2026punished if I didn\u2019t get it right the first time.\u201d\nThe newcomers were exchanging surprised looks. Rishe understood why.\nEverything Diana said was familiar to them. They spent valuable time searching for their materials and the proper ways to use them, but they shrank from asking for help. Everyone always looked so busy. This was a universal problem.\n\u201cDespite all that, I got better!\u201d Diana protested. \u201cI only needed to be taught once. Unlike them! They\u2019re useless!\u201d\n\u201cYes, well. There\u2019s a difference between you and them,\u201d Rishe told Diana. \u201cYou can read and write.\u201d\n\u201cOh!\u201d Diana started in surprise. Elsie looked at the floor.\nThe literacy rate among commoners was low no matter where you went. Very few families had the means to afford an education, especially for daughters. Diana had been born to a merchant\u2019s family\u2014she\u2019d received formal schooling. The maids she was close friends with were likely from similar backgrounds. The majority of those in service were not so fortunate.\n\u201cWhat if you only received instructions on how to do a job once and weren\u2019t able to write it down to remind yourself later?\u201d Rishe asked. \u201cWould you be so confident?\u201d\n\u201cI-I don\u2019t\u2014\u201d Diana reflexively thrust a hand into her apron pocket, where she had a list of daily tasks recorded in her neat handwriting to reference throughout the day. Hopefully now she would understand how much of an edge her privileged literacy gave her over the other maids.\n\u201cEveryone else works as hard as they can, just like you do,\u201d Rishe said. \u201cRemember how it was for you at first? They all have to start somewhere. I hope you\u2019ll keep that in mind.\u201d\n\u201cThey\u2019re no different from me,\u201d Diana mumbled begrudgingly, glancing around the room, looking at the less experienced maids. As if coming to a decision, she said, \u201cI\u2019m sorry",
    "query_text": ".\u201d\n\u201cDiana?\u201d\nLike a child enumerating her regrets, Diana went on, \u201cI\u2019ve done you wrong, all of you. It\u2019s just, I had nothing. Or so it felt like. No money, no title. I thought I had to make my way in the world on my own. That I had to start from zero.\u201d Her shoulders trembled as she buried her face in her hands. \u201cBut I was wrong! I wasn\u2019t starting from zero. I had everything that I learned growing up. I didn\u2019t realize how fortunate I was. I let it all go to my he\n \n\u201cRISHE IRMGARD WEITZNER! You are a vile woman! A truly malicious creature unworthy of the crown prince! As of this instant, our engagement is off!\u201d \n\u201cAs you wish, Your Highness.\u201d\n\u201c\u2026Huh?\u201d\nThe prince\u2019s declaration echoed throughout the ballroom. Rishe, the duke\u2019s daughter,"

    "prefix_text": " She needed to beat the messenger bearing news of her scandal.\nAs she ran, she yanked off her hair ornaments; she planned to sell them and didn\u2019t want to risk losing one. Her hair billowed out behind her, falling in loose waves.\nSuddenly, an idea occurred to her, one she hadn\u2019t had in any of her previous six lives.\nLeaving through the palace gardens would be faster. I can climb down a tree from the balcony.\nRishe had gone to war as a knight in the life just before this one. After the punishing battlefield training, climbing trees was nothing.\nSeamlessly, she changed direction. She raced for the balcony, where she ran into something at full speed.\n\u201cBwargh!\u201d Rishe let out a very unladylike grunt, staggering a few steps. She looked up to see what she\u2019d bounced off of. \u201cOh\u2026\u201d\nAn exceptionally handsome man stood in her path.\nHe had refined, patrician features and cruel, thin lips. He was slender yet powerful; even through his clothes, Rishe could tell his body was well conditioned. His jet-black hair covered his ears, creeping down to the nape of his neck. The tips of his locks bounced with his movements. They looked to be soft to the touch.\nFrom head to toe, he was a pleasure to look at\u2014but what held Rishe\u2019s attention were his eyes. They were long in shape and impossibly blue, but they possessed a blade-sharp intensity. His gaze was clear, beautiful, and cold as ice. His eyelashes cast shadows on his striking face. He was a work of art.\nCurrently, this work of art was staring her down with a look that could kill.\nHe laughed. \u201cYou barreled right into me. For a moment, I thought I\u2019d been attacked by a wild boar.\u201d\nIt was an exceedingly rude thing to say to a stranger, but as luck would have it, this man was not a stranger. At least not to Rishe.\n\u201cWhat are you even doing here?\u201d the man went on. \u201cThe party is in the\u2014\u201d\nRishe interrupted him with a wordless shout of dismay. The man drew back, reflexively reaching for his sword. He composed himself with visible difficulty. \u201cWho are you? You look like any noblewoman, but your manner is\u2026\u201d \n\u201cEmperor Arnold Hein!\u201d \nThe man\u2019s eyes widened. He didn\u2019t mistake her surging contempt. Rishe had crossed swords with this man. Recently. He was the one responsible for ending her sixth life. \nHe must be a guest at the banquet. It makes sense.\nArnold Hein was the scion of a military nation not far from Rishe\u2019s home country of Hermity, the one in which they now stood. Their kingdoms, so recently at war, had brokered an ostensible peace, and the two ruling families met from time to time. Crown Prince Dietrich\u2019s engagement party would be one such occasion. He\u2019d gathered elites from far and wide to introduce to his beloved Mary.\nThe man eyed Rishe with rising curiosity. \u201cYou know me? This is my first time in Hermity.\u201d\nUh-oh. Rishe pasted on a smile as her mind spun in circles. This man was dangerous. She had to avoid entanglements with him at all costs. Five years from now, Arnold Hein would invade Hermity. \nHe was an extraordinarily skilled swordsman and, with a powerful military at his back, was destined to conquer kingdom after kingdom. He had done as much in her second, third, fourth, and fifth lives. In her sixth, Rishe had faced him in battle herself and died by his hand.\nWe never had a chance. That war was lost before it began.\nArnold\u2019s brilliance lay not in his swordplay but in his skill as a tactician. He set countries up for conquest and knocked them down, swallowing them one by one.\nI know him, but he doesn\u2019t know me. We haven\u2019t met in this life. I need an excuse fast. \nRishe curtsied slowly. \u201cMy name is Rishe Irmgard Weitzner. We\u2019ve never been introduced, but I\u2019ve heard of you.\u201d\nArnold donned an amused smile. \u201cYou plant your weight like a trained swordswoman. Your center of gravity is perfect.\u201d\n\u201cYou exaggerate,\u201d Rishe demurred. \u201cThat was simply a curtsy to an esteemed guest.\u201d \n\u201cI must have misheard, but I swear you called me \u2018emperor\u2019 just now.\u201d \nRishe froze.\n\u201cMy father yet lives,\u201d Arnold said. \u201cI am simply a crown prince. Why would you call me that?\u201d \n\u201cUh, um\u2026\u201d Rishe floundered for an answer.\nShe\u2019d made such a foolish mistake. Arnold\u2019s gaze cut right through her. It felt like he\u2019d see through any lie she told right down to her soul. She remembered this from the battlefield\u2014how his attention alone felt like a sword thrust.\nBut why even bother to lie? They\u2019d never meet again, so who cared what he thought of her? Sure, she harbored a hard feeling or two over the recent slaying, but there was no point complaining about it to this Arnold. Calling him the emperor was boorish, but Rishe was in the process of being forcibly exiled. Why play at diplomacy?\nShe took a deep breath and bowed low. This was not the curtsy of a noble lady but of a servant bowing in supplication to her master.\n\u201cMy humblest apologies, Your Highness. I was in a rush. Such a rude slip of the tongue.\u201d She raised her head. \u201cMy ex-fianc\u00e9 just annulled our engagement, so I\u2019ve got a lot on my mind. If you would excuse me.\u201d \n\u201cHe annulled your engagement?\u201d\nAt that, Rishe turned and fled.\nThis unexpected run-in with Arnold had taken up valuable time. She threw open the door to the balcony and hiked up her skirts, kicking off her shoes in anticipation of jumping into a tree. Looking down, she realized the ground was far closer than she\u2019d feared.\nExcellent! I can just drop into the garden!\nArnold, who up until now had been rendered speechless, shook himself out of his fugue as Rishe clambered over the railing. \u201cHey!\u201d\nRishe\u2019s moonlight-silver dress flowed around her as she leapt. The lawn was soft, but the fall was still far enough to risk injury.\nWeight evenly distributed on the soles of my feet, roll to transfer the impact to my shins and thighs, then onto my hips and my back.\nShe landed safely, rolled nimbly in her dress, and popped back up. Her hair was covered in leaves. \nI need to hurry up!\nBracing against a nearby rock, she used her weight to snap the heels off of her shoes. There. That would make running a little easier. Satisfied, she slipped them back on and made haste toward the family estate. \n \n***\n \nUp on the balcony, Crown Prince Arnold of Galkhein watched the spectacle play out from beginning to end. He gazed at the girl with the coral hair. Her appearance was that of any young noblewoman, but she moved like a well-trained knight. She\u2019d leapt from the balcony and landed skillfully, showing no signs of distress at her ripped dress or disheveled hair. Instead, she\u2019d knocked the heels off her shoes and dashed away.\nAlso, she had called him an emperor.\nPlaying it all over again in his head, Arnold broke out into a rare chuckle. As his shoulders quivered with laughter, his attendant approached him from behind.\n\u201cThere you are, Your Highness. What are you doing out here? I\u2019m aware you don\u2019t desire a wife, but beginning the search would be wise\u2026 Er, Your Highness?\u201d The attendant\u2019s eyes flew wide. His bored and scowling master was laughing. \u201cDid something happen?\u201d\n\u201cOliver, ready my coach. Wait, no. That will take too much time. Bring me a horse.\u201d\n\u201cAt once, Your Highness. Might I ask why?\u201d\nArnold didn\u2019t respond\u2014he just grinned like a hungry wolf catching scent of his prey.\n \n***\n \nOnce outside the palace gates, Rishe threw herself into the waiting coach, shouting for the driver to make haste. She stopped it a few hundred yards from the manor and bid him farewell. \u201cI\u2019m leaving! Thanks for always being such a safe driver, Daniel!\u201d\nThe road to the manor was muddy from a morning rain shower. She knew from her second life that the coach would get stuck, resulting in a loss of valuable time. It was better to just get out and run. \n\u201cHuff, huff.\u201d Despite her last life\u2019s physical conditioning, this body had no stamina. She\u2019d need to try to get fitter faster this time around.\nRishe reached the end of the road, and her heart promptly sank all the way to her feet. \u201cOh no.\u201d\nThe front door was thronged with people, all of them surrounding a carriage bearing the royal family\u2019s coat of arms.\nI need to get out of here.\nWhile she stood frozen in indecision, one of the knights doing crowd control shouted, \u201cYour Highness! I have eyes on Lady Rishe!\u201d\n\u201cGet out of my way!\u201d A familiar voice started up a bellow. \u201cLet me through! Rishe, how dare you make me wait so long?\u201d\nRishe\u2019s ex-fianc\u00e9, Crown Prince Dietrich, stepped triumphantly forward.\n\u201cI know the thought of hearing your crimes enumerated by the man you love must pain you, but alas, as future king, it is my duty to bring down the hammer of justice upon a villainess such as yourself!\u201d\n\u201cI see I\u2019ve timed it badly,\u201d Rishe muttered. \u201cIn fact, this is my worst loop yet. I\u2019d rather be barred from the house than see you again.\u201d\n\u201cHmm? What are you grumbling about?\u201d Dietrich looked Rishe up and down. \u201cI knew it. You put on a brave face, but I can sense the sorrow in your heart.\u201d\n\u201cI beg your pardon?\u201d\n\u201cYour heart!\u201d the prince repeated. \u201cYour heart! It must be absolutely crushed! Because I called off our engagement!\u201d\nRishe wasn\u2019t sure where he was drawing these conclusions from. Possibly the same place he mined for all his bottomless self-confidence.\n\u201cI can tell you\u2019ve been wandering aimlessly, distraught,\u201d the prince went on. \u201cLook at you. Your dress is caked in mud, your shoes are broken, and there are cuts marring your face and arms. What other possible cause could there be than heartbreak?\u201d\nRishe narrowed her eyes. \u201cDo you ever stop to think about the words coming out of your mouth?\u201d\n\u201cWhat?\u201d\nHis interpretation of events was fanciful to the point of absurdity. \u201cI did not dirty my dress or snap my shoes out of heartbreak. Because I feel none. You\u2019ve always been a little slow, so I\u2019ll make this clear: I do not have a single shred of fondness for you, or for our broken engagement.\u201d\n\u201cWhat?!\u201d the prince said. \u201cWhat are you saying?!\u201d\nThe surrounding crowd began to snicker.\n\u201cIsn\u2019t that the crown prince? Did Lady Rishe just dump him?\u201d\n\u201cWait, but wasn\u2019t he trying to dump her?\u201d\n\u201cCan\u2019t be! Look at her! She doesn\u2019t care at all!\u201d\n\u201cHow dare you nobodies make sport of me?\u201d Dietrich screeched. \u201cI am your prince!\u201d\nTemper aside, Dietrich was a handsome man. He had azure-blue eyes and blond hair\u2014a prince straight out of a picture book. His looks and place in the succession meant a never-ending swarm of women vying for his affections. He was brought up a pampered princeling, never wanting for anything. It manifested in a pompous manner and an overconfidence in his own abilities. Rishe had cautioned him about his attitude before, but he never paid her any mind.\nI\u2019m so glad I don\u2019t have to marry him.\nShe wished she could go back and tell the shocked, scared girl from her first life not to worry about her shattered engagement. Still, she might as well say it all here and now, with the assembled knights and citizens to bear witness.\n\u201cYour Highness, you exist to love and protect your people. It\u2019s unbecoming to speak of them in this manner.\u201d\n\u201cYou\u2019re the unbecoming one!\u201d the prince snapped. \u201cBeg me for forgiveness!\u201d\n\u201cI won\u2019t. Calling off our betrothal is the best course, and I applaud Your Highness for your good sense.\u201d\nNow even the knights were trembling with suppressed mirth. \nDietrich was turning red. \u201cD-don\u2019t laugh at me!\u201d\n\u201cLady Rishe,\u201d came a sweet voice. \u201cAren\u2019t you ashamed of yourself?\u201d \nRishe fought down a groan.\nOut of the crowd stepped a charming, dainty girl. Her big eyes moist with tears, she took her place at Dietrich\u2019s side. \u201cI do not allow the people I care about to be treated so very ill!\u201d \n\u201cWhy, Lady Mary. You\u2019re here.\u201d Rishe sighed. \u201cHow nice.\u201d\nThe young Mary scowled through her tears. Hidden behind her skirts, Dietrich continued to shout his disapproval. \u201cRishe! You\u2019ve brought my beloved Mary to tears! She\u2019s told me everything. How you bullied her, ridiculed her. How you find it amusing to lock her in the classroom overnight! Such a wicked woman could never be queen!\u201d\nNone of that\u2019s true.\nRishe glanced at Mary, who averted her gaze a little awkwardly.\n\u201cMore importantly,\u201d Rishe said, \u201chave you already brought your concerns to my parents, Your Highness?\u201d\n\u201cMore importantly?! I did, if you must know! Your parents are furious. They have vowed to disown you.\u201d\n\u201cAh. Then I\u2019m too late.\u201d Her parents held their reputation above all else. Rishe had little hope of retrieving any of her money or belongings now.\n\u201cWhy are you acting so strangely?\u201d Dietrich sniffed. \u201cAh, I understand. You\u2019re in such shock from this turn of events that\u2014\u201d\n\u201cListen, Dietrich.\u201d In her exasperation, Rishe dropped his title. \u201cI accept your decree. We are no longer engaged. I shall never darken your doorstep again. So\u2026relax a little.\u201d\n\u201cHuh? What are you saying?\u201d\n\u201cSince I was a child, I believed that my only value was in our betrothal. Being engaged to the crown prince was my whole reason for living. I was wrong about that. Only I determine my value\u2014no one else. That\u2019s why I don\u2019t care about this. I\u2019m beyond it.\u201d Rishe made sure to look him directly in the eye as she spoke. \u201cYou are an unnecessary element in my life.\u201d\nDietrich staggered back. His legs seemed to go out from under him, and he crumpled. At that, the knights finally let go of their composure, laughing along with the courtiers.\n\u201cSt-stop!\u201d the prince wailed. \u201cYou are my subjects. This\u2026this shows such flagrant disrespect!\u201d\n\u201cDietrich, don\u2019t pay them any mind,\u201d Lady Mary said. \u201cLady Rishe, is this cruelty necessary?\u201d\n\u201cPerhaps this is a blessing in disguise.\u201d Rishe\u2019s attention moved to Mary, making the girl\u2019s slender shoulders jump. She had no reason to worry; Rishe didn\u2019t bite. \u201cI\u2019ve been wanting the opportunity to speak to you, Lady Mary. You\u2019re strong. I admire you very much.\u201d\n\u201cWhat are you talking about?\u201d\n\u201cYou\u2019re a lovely girl who never fails to smile despite your troubles. You don\u2019t put up walls around your heart, and you do your utmost to put others at ease. Even now, you bravely stand before me to protect the prince.\u201d\nMary\u2019s eyes were wide with confusion. Rishe picked her words carefully, attempting to diminish the girl\u2019s guilty feelings, if only a little. \u201cYou need to marry the prince for your family\u2019s sake, right?\u201d\n\u201cHow do you\u2014?\u201d\nRishe had learned this truth in one of her past lives. Mary was born to a poor family, and she had studied like mad to be accepted into the academy to hunt for a husband. She intended to make sure neither she nor her brothers ever went hungry again.\nShe went on, \u201cRemember this: you are the one in control of your life. Don\u2019t sell it to anyone else. Can you trust a man who so easily discards the woman he\u2019s been engaged to since childhood? Do you truly believe he cares for you?\u201d\nAstonishment bloomed across Mary\u2019s face. She looked over at Dietrich, who hadn\u2019t bothered to stand up. The truth was\u2026within a year, Prince Dietrich would be in prison, his title stripped from him. He would plan a mad coup d\u2019\u00e9tat against the king, attempting to provoke the citizens to war. His plan would be discovered in its early stages, rendering him a laughingstock across the kingdom.\n\u201cYou must shape your future with your own hands\u2014you mustn\u2019t entrust your desires to others.\u201d \n\u201cMy\u2026my desires?\nRishe nodded.\nMary was looking at her like she was speaking a foreign language. \u201cBut I\u2019m their elder sister.\u201d Her voice quivered. \u201cI must endure, no matter what. Otherwise, my brothers will never be happy.\u201d\n\u201cAnd you believe their happiness can only be achieved by sacrificing your own?\u201d\nMary gasped as she gaped at Rishe.\n\u201cYou don\u2019t need to throw away your own future to protect those you love,\u201d Rishe told her. \u201cNo matter what path you choose, never forget that.\u201d\n\u201cMy future?\u201d Mary\u2019s voice went ragged, like she was barely suppressing a wail of pain.\n\u201cI wish you a life where both you and your family can be happy,\u201d said Rishe.\nMary stood frozen in place, eyes gleaming like precious stones. Rishe couldn\u2019t help but admire how pretty she was. She truly did wish her happiness. But right now, she needed to take care of herself. \n\u201cWell.\u201d Rishe suddenly broke into a smile, making Dietrich flinch. \u201cI think it\u2019s time for me to be on my way.\u201d\nShe regretted losing access to her room, but she knew her parents wouldn\u2019t let her in. Turning her back on the crowd, Rishe contemplated her next move.\n\u201cWait, Lady Rishe!\u201d Mary\u2019s",
    "query_text": " voice rang out.\n\u201cThat\u2019s right. You\u2019re not going anywhere, Rishe!\u201d The prince joined her. \u201cYou won\u2019t get away with treating me like trash to relieve your own injured heart.\u201d\n\u201cUgh, enough already!\u201d Rishe\u2019s patience was fraying. \u201cI don\u2019t have anything else to say to you. Goodbye!\u201d\n\u201cKnights, stop her!\u201d\nReluctantly, the knights moved to tail Rishe as she walked briskly back down the path. She sympathized with them, but she wasn\u2019t about to let them keep her here. Rounding a corner, she sensed something uncanny. She stopped, the knights quickly catching up with her.\n\u201cMy apologies, Lady Rishe. If you could please remain for just a\u2014whoa!\u201d\n"

    "prefix_text": "Huh, what do you know? Once he became emperor, he\u2019d gladly behead any subject who so much as dared speak a word against him.\nI guess at nineteen he still knew how to apologize.\nIf that surprised her, Arnold\u2019s next act completely obliterated her sense of reality. \nWith a flourish, he fell to his knees. \n\u201cHuh?\u201d Is this actually happening? \nHe was a man destined for an imperial crown. A man who would stand at the head of a military powerhouse and spread his rule across continents.\nArnold, known for his frigid pride, knelt to the disgraced daughter of a duke.\nAnd not only that\u2014his head was bowed, looking nothing so much as a knight swearing allegiance to his lady. If it were anyone else, it would be a delightful, pious image. Instead, the assembled looked on in terrified awe.\nNot Rishe, though.\n\u201cWhat are you doing?\u201d she hissed. \u201cGet up!\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m apologizing for my baseless impertinence. Also, I\u2019m asking you\u2026\u201d He trailed off to take Rishe\u2019s hand, tugging her forward so forcefully she staggered. He gazed up at her.\nUgh. He\u2019s so beautiful. No matter how many times she looked at him, it didn\u2019t become any less disarming. Long eyelashes, arched brows, a noble nose. His bright blue eyes reminded her of the drift ice she\u2019d seen in a northern kingdom, gazing out from a ship in one of her past lives. She knew she was dwelling on this to buy time, even as the reality before her sank in.\n\u201c\u2026to become my wife.\u201d\nShe froze, unable to process the words. \u201cWhat?\u201d Rishe glanced around, desperately searching the faces of the crowd. They all seemed as stunned as she felt. She looked down at Arnold again. \u201cYour wife?\u201d \n\u201cYes, that\u2019s right.\u201d\n\u201cYou want me to become your wife?\u201d\n\u201cYes.\u201d\nRishe couldn\u2019t speak. This was truly happening. It was real. It clicked into place in her head, and she let out a strangled grunt.\nWhat is going on? Why is this happening?\nShock lapped at her, fuzzing at the corners of her vision. He wanted to marry her. Arnold wanted to marry Rishe. Her murderer wanted to marry her.\nWhy is he doing this? He must have some ulterior motive, a broader goal. But I have to give him an answer.\nThe onlookers were holding their breath as Rishe said flatly, \u201cI reject your proposal.\u201d\nArnold said nothing.\nShe had to reject him. She was going to live a long, peaceful, carefree life, damn it, and no one would stop her. And yet\u2026\nArnold began to laugh, and the deep, creeping sense of dread inside Rishe only grew. Why does he seem so amused by this?!\n \n***\n \nHer previous life was her sixth. Disguised as a man, Rishe rose as a warrior of an island country she came upon in her travels. It was a conventional yet charming kingdom formed of red brick. After striking up a friendship with a group of knights who didn\u2019t realize she was a woman, Rishe followed their advice and joined them.\nThe training was grueling enough to make her wish she were dead. Back when she had lived as a noble, she\u2019d learned how to wield a sword for basic self-defense, but training as a noble lady had in no way prepared her for this. She drilled relentlessly, barely taking the time to sleep. Just as she became a full-fledged knight, Emperor Arnold\u2019s forces lay siege to the castle.\n \n***\n \nHow could this happen? \nIn her seventh life, Rishe wearily sank into her chair. Across from her sat Arnold, his legs crossed and chin propped up on his hand, watching her lazily.\n\u201cWhat\u2019s the matter?\u201d he asked. \u201cYou seem unhappy.\u201d\n\u201cYou could say that.\u201d Even her voice was grumpy. Still, she couldn\u2019t very well tell him it was because she bore a grudge from a previous life. After the first time her life rewound to that pivotal moment, she\u2019d resolved to keep her loops a secret. \u201cI had plans for my exile. A brand-new life. And now because of you, my parents are involved. Even the king has heard about it!\u201d\nAfter Rishe rejected Arnold, Dietrich had immediately cried out, \u201cTh-the crown prince of Galkhein proposed to Rishe?!\u201d\nHis shrieks were loud enough to attract the attention of the master and mistress of the manor.\nWhen her parents came out, Rishe had protested, \u201cI\u2019m not going to marry him! I\u2019m leaving the country just as Dietrich commanded.\u201d\nNo one listened. Their faces just paled with nervous confusion.\nJust then, a glittering coach arrived. Half-stuck in the mud, the man inside it was forced to trudge over the swampy ground, and so the king of Hermity himself arrived, staggering and dirt-stained. \nHe grabbed hold of his son\u2019s collar, pushing him into a low bow. He then turned to Prince Arnold and said, rather loudly, \u201cYour Highness! Allow me to apologize for my son\u2019s foolishness! You are an esteemed guest all the way from Galkhein! It is unthinkable he would not offer you the courtesy you are due!\u201d\n\u201cYou\u2019re hurting me, Father! My back!\u201d\nThe king then turned to Rishe. \u201cMy lady, allow me to sincerely apologize as both a king and a father. My son\u2019s behavior toward you has been utterly disgraceful. I beg you to please give Prince Arnold\u2019s proposal due consideration. Not only for your own sake but for the sake of your country.\u201d\nThe king bowed to her as deeply as his son had to Arnold, and her parents joined him. Rishe felt dizzy at the sight of this abject debasement in the presence of citizens.\nArnold, who had been watching the proceedings with a detached amusement, sobered and stepped toward the king. \u201cYour Majesty, please rise.\u201d\nWithout the smirk, Arnold\u2019s face immediately reverted to its cold mask. The king didn\u2019t move. Maybe something in Arnold\u2019s voice kept him frozen.\n\u201cSuch a trifle won\u2019t cause discord between our kingdoms,\u201d he went on. \u201cHowever, I would beg a little time to speak with Lady Rishe.\u201d\nLater, Rishe would learn that Arnold\u2019s attendant had spoken to the king\u2019s own gentleman, certain that his words would reach their target. \u201cMy master took such trouble to attend these festivities, and this is the welcome he is offered? I wonder, what will the emperor think when he learns of his son\u2019s slighting at your nation\u2019s hands?\u201d\n\u201cIf you would, Lady Rishe?\u201d The plump king looked to be on the verge of tears.\nRishe had no obligation to accept and no desire to spend a moment longer in this country than was absolutely necessary. But acquiescence seemed the fastest way to move things along.\nAs her mind whirled, Arnold leaned in to whisper, \u201cIf you refuse to hear my suit, you won\u2019t deter me. I\u2019ll simply move on to Plan B.\u201d\nAnd that was how she found herself in one of the palace\u2019s parlors, here to \u201cjust talk\u201d to Prince Arnold. The ball guests were all gone. It was just the two of them.\n\u201cI want to know what you\u2019re planning,\u201d Rishe said flatly.\n\u201cPlanning? Me?\u201d\n\u201cBy asking me to marry you. You don\u2019t know me. A proposal like this wouldn\u2019t come out of the blue.\u201d\nThis man was destined to become an aggressive warmonger over the next few years. He wouldn\u2019t do anything without a dozen motives.\nPrince Arnold just smiled. \u201cI have no plans. I\u2019m simply enamored with you.\u201d\n\u201cEnamored\u2026?\u201d\nThat was the last thing she\u2019d expected him to say. Asking him to elaborate didn\u2019t seem worth the breath\u2014he was obviously lying. As if this ruthless, inhuman creature with ice in his veins could feel even a flicker of affection.\n\u201cWhy refuse me?\u201d Arnold asked. \u201cYour engagement is broken, you\u2019re on the verge of exile, and you have no faction or supporters. At this rate, you\u2019ll be dead within a fortnight. I\u2019d call my offer a stroke of unbelievable fortune.\u201d\n\u201cYou\u2019re not wrong,\u201d Rishe admitted. \u201cOnce upon a time, I would have jumped at your offer.\u201d\nIf it had been made in her first life, for instance. But now Rishe knew better. Her life was only just getting started, and the future held endless possibilities. After the horror of her sixth loop, she yearned for freedom.\nI don\u2019t want to marry him. I won\u2019t be anyone\u2019s captive. Still\u2026\nRishe, more than anyone, knew that the slightest adjustment could enact profound changes on the trajectory of a life. No doubt she\u2019d have many more lives, but this could be the only one where marriage to Arnold would be an option.\nThe dread emperor. The tyrant. The man who will stoke the fires of war. \nRishe knew the gossip, the endless conjecture behind Arnold Hein\u2019s bloody reign, but she didn\u2019t know the truth.\nWhy? The question had haunted her since her first life. She\u2019d never before had the chance to even speak to him.\nShe had wondered it as a merchant, hearing of the distant outbreak of war. She\u2019d wondered when the news of the dead and dying reached her apothecary. When she had comforted her terrified mistress in her life as a maid, assuring her everything would be all right. When she squared off against him in battle, as he plunged a sword through her heart\u2014even then she wondered. \nIf I stick around, maybe I\u2019ll finally have my answer. Half of her was dying to know. The other half didn\u2019t give a damn. And yet\u2026\nShe recalled a childhood dream. Rather, a longing.\nRishe let out a breath. \u201cYou claim you are enamored with me.\u201d\n\u201cYes. I am completely under your spell.\u201d\nTo think he could spout such nonsense with a straight face!\n\u201cThen will you grant me anything I desire?\u201d\n\u201cSo long as it is within my power,\u201d Arnold said. \u201cAnything you want will be yours.\u201d\nRishe hesitated, gathering her thoughts. \u201cI have some conditions.\u201d Arnold silently motioned for her to go on. \u201cI want full control over the wedding festivities. Everything must be procured through merchants of my choosing.\u201d\n\u201cFine.\u201d Arnold nodded. \u201cYou\u2019re free to do business with whomever you wish.\u201d\n\u201cAfter we are married, I must be in a position to mingle with guests from abroad.\u201d\n\u201cThat sounds within the purview of the crown princess. Anything else?\u201d\n\u201cI will be allowed to live in a separate residence from your mother and father.\u201d\nShe meant this seriously, but it made Arnold laugh. \u201cYou don\u2019t seem the type to worry about an overbearing mother-in-law.\u201d\n\u201cYou would be surprised. Combative relationships with one\u2019s new family are the most difficult part of marriage, or so they say. It could be a ramshackle cottage for all I care\u2014I just require a secondary residence.\u201d\nActually, Rishe didn\u2019t care at all about in-laws. When Arnold set his war into motion, his first move would be the assassination of his father. A genuine coup by patricide, not at all like Dietrich\u2019s clumsy attempt. Next, he would name himself emperor, take control of the country, and mobilize the military.\nSeparating him from his parents will make the first step more difficult\u2014although not impossible, unfortunately.\n\u201cAnything else?\u201d Arnold asked. \u201cI\u2019ll do whatever it takes to marry you.\u201d\n\u201cIdeally, I\u2019d like to know your endgame,\u201d Rishe said with dignity. \u201cBut as I doubt there\u2019s any chance of that, I have one final request.\u201d She jabbed a finger into his face, regardless of how rude it was. \u201cI will spend my time idling around the castle. No work, no study. I shall be utterly useless.\u201d\nLet\u2019s see just how much you want me as your princess.\nAfter a long moment of silence, Arnold cracked a merry laugh. The proposal remained; all her conditions were met.\n\n(2) chapter number given is likely out of range: 0\nChapter: 7\n\nChapter 2\nChapter 2\n \n\u201cYOU KNOW, it was only after I went into commerce that I truly had a dream for the future,\u201d Rishe had once confided in a friend. \u201cUp until then, I existed only as the crown prince\u2019s fianc\u00e9e or my father\u2019s daughter. My every act was to become more worthy of that status. But now, for the first time, I actually have a goal of my own.\u201d\n\u201cOh, yeah?\u201d her friend said. He was the ruler of the desert kingdom, and his smile was awfully charming. \u201cWhat\u2019s that?\u201d\nRishe smiled back. \u201cI want to travel to every single country in the world. I want to see everything in every town, peruse their markets, and meet the eyes of every person who lives there!\u201d\nBy now, that felt like such a distant dream.\n \n***\n \nRishe awoke with a start, eyes snapping open as she sensed a disturbance in the air.\nShe unsheathed her sword halfway, primed for danger. \nInside the coach, her old enemy sat across from her, one hand outstretched. \u201cWhat do you think you\u2019re doing?\u201d she demanded.\nWhen they\u2019d boarded the coach, Rishe had warned him not to lay a single finger on her throughout the trip to his kingdom. Ordering the prince not to touch his consort was absurd, but Arnold readily agreed. He had, after all, promised to follow her every direction.\nAnd yet, here he was, already breaking his promise.\nArnold appeared unperturbed by her glare. \u201cDon\u2019t look at me like that. I was merely trying to recover what you took from me.\u201d\nConfused, Rishe looked at the sword in her hand. It had a black lacquered scabbard with a simple golden decoration. Engraved on the hilt was the Galkhein crest.\n\u201cOh!\u201d Rishe thrust the sword back at Arnold. \u201cMy apologies.\u201d\nArnold chuckled. \u201cYou caught me off guard. You were nodding off, and then you suddenly snatched up my sword. You looked quite content snuggling up with it.\u201d\nArnold propped the sword beside him. Rishe pressed a hand to her chest to quell her racing heart. The sword that gutted me in my previous life is now my bedmate. What a world. Her recent stint as a knight had left her ill at ease without a blade at hand. She just couldn\u2019t believe it was Arnold\u2019s she\u2019d reached for.\n\u201cI didn\u2019t mean to disturb you, but I doubted sleeping with a weapon would be comfortable. I\u2019m impressed you sensed my intent before I even touched you.\u201d Arnold rested one elbow against the window frame, watching her with shameless fascination. \u201cOne only develops instincts like that from combat training. And you were also a member of the court? How in the world did you find the time?\u201d\nRishe shrugged. She couldn\u2019t just say, I pretended to be a man in a previous life, that\u2019s how.\n\u201cI assume there\u2019s more to you than your devotion to the sword. You seem to like flowers.\u201d\nShe followed Arnold\u2019s gaze to where she\u2019d bundled a small bouquet in a handkerchief. This was their fifth day on the road to Galkhein. Every day, without fail, she\u2019d picked flowers whenever they stopped to water the horses. The ones from today were still fresh, but the ones she\u2019d begun drying five days ago were just about ready.\n\u201cI didn\u2019t pick these because they\u2019re pretty.\u201d Rishe brought the blooms to her face, spirits rising at their sweet scent. Spring wildflowers had a soft and gentle smell. Rishe looked out the window at the forest spreading toward Galkhein, thinking of the rare native flowers going into bloom. She wished she could pick those as well, but that would cause too much delay. She gazed on wistfully.\nAfter watching her in silence for some time, Arnold said, \u201cBy the way, I sent one of my men ahead on a fast horse to deliver your order to the company you requested. They\u2019ll be invited to Galkhein to discuss the wedding ceremony.\u201d\n\u201cThank you,\u201d Rishe said. \u201cI\u2019m glad you kept your word.\u201d\n\u201cThe Aria Trading Company,\u201d Arnold mused. \u201cI\u2019ve heard of them. They\u2019re up-and-comers, aren\u2019t they? Have you done business with them before?\u201d\n\u201cNo, but I heard from a friend that they hold a very high standard of quality.\u201d\nRishe was pleasantly surprised at how easily Arnold had acceded to her request. Typically, a royal household had their own personal dealer. Getting them to do business with someone else could be difficult.\nI want to establish a connection with Aria as soon as possible, Rishe thought. It was, of course, the company that had taken her in during her first life.\nThe company",
    "query_text": " had been established just two years prior to picking her up by its owner, a man named Tully. They were still in their growth stage, but in just a few years, they would be the grandest trading company in all the world. They\u2019d proven a great boon in her life as an apothecary as well, helping to distribute her newest medicines. She\u2019d struggled to win their trust initially, but she pledged to work"

    "prefix_text": " injured knight groaned as another helped him up. \u201cWhat\u2019s wrong with you?\u201d the second knight asked the first. \n\u201cI-I feel\u2026numb.\u201d\n\u201cWhat? Damn.\u201d The knight grabbed up one of the fallen bandit\u2019s swords, going pale as he inspected the blade. \u201cYour Highness, look at this. Poison.\u201d\nArnold clicked his tongue. \u201cLocate every laceration and bind them close to the heart. Suck the poison from the wounds.\u201d\nHe mostly got that right, at least. In the meantime, Rishe located the nearest bound bandit and pulled his dagger out of its sheath. Its wet coating gleamed in the sunlight, just as the knight had said.\nThey applied the poison liberally\u2014whatever it is must be cheap and easily bought in bulk.\nShe wafted the smell toward her, bracing for something rancid, but detected nothing. Then she brought it closer to her nose.\nIt smells sweet, like an overripe apple. Shea grass and\u2026bluecap mushrooms. All the knights appear to have the same symptoms, so I won\u2019t have to check every blade.\nRishe stood back up and headed for the coach.\nOliver took a step after her. \u201cYour Highness, Lady Rishe is\u2014\u201d\n\u201cLeave her. She may do as she pleases.\u201d\n\u201cShe\u2019s well trained,\u201d Oliver mused. \u201cBut a battlefield is no place for a young lady. She probably wasn\u2019t prepared for such a dreadful spectacle.\u201d\nRishe ignored the murmurs and focused on her work. There they are. I\u2019ll take these, these, and\u2026\n\u201cThe poison must be a sleeping drug,\u201d she overheard Arnold saying. \u201cHunters use such drugs to weaken larger prey. I doubt this dose is lethal.\u201d\n\u201cBut it certainly is annoying,\u201d replied Oliver. \u201cWe\u2019re still two days out from Galkhein. Lugging a company of sleeping men in armor won\u2019t be pleasant.\u201d\n\u201cWe\u2019ll have to stop somewhere nearby. A hunter\u2019s settlement. Perhaps they will have an antidote\u2014\u201d\n\u201cExcuse me.\u201d Rishe, who\u2019d returned from the carriage, raised a hand. \u201cI have an antidote.\u201d\n\u201cWhat?\u201d\nThe entire company stared at her in awe.\n \n***\n \nAs it turned out, Arnold\u2019s guess was right. \nThis sweet-smelling substance was a hunter\u2019s drug, made from ingredients that were only toxic in their raw form. Heat rendered them harmless. Rishe had encountered this poison several times before, curing a customer afflicted with it during her life as an apothecary.\n\u201cA lethal dose for a grown man would fill a wine glass. They likely got less than a hundredth of that,\u201d Rishe explained to Arnold, not looking up from her work. \u201cStill, the numbness can block their airways with the roots of their tongues. It\u2019s best to lay them on their sides.\u201d\n\u201cYes, I understand the theory and the solution.\u201d Arnold gazed down at Rishe\u2019s hands. \u201cThe part I\u2019m struggling with is why you\u2019re the one telling me this.\u201d\n\u201cWell, I know how to make the antidote,\u201d Rishe said patiently as she muddled the herbs together in the white soup bowl she\u2019d borrowed for her flowers. She crushed them with the back of a spoon before adding another dried flower, crushing that as well, and combining them to form a paste. This process would be easier with a pestle, but she wasn\u2019t about to complain. \u201cThis poison is common\u2014it\u2019s cheap and easy to make, which often means the antidote is simple as well.\u201d\nThe antidote was synthesized, in fact, when hunters witnessed a deer showing no symptoms after eating a certain mushroom. They tested those along with other common herbs the deer ate. Rishe mentally thanked them for their scientific rigor as she added a bit of water, straining it all through a cloth.\nRishe stood up, brandishing the bowl of bright green medicine. \u201cBoiling would make the antidote more potent, but this works in a pinch.\u201d\nThat was when she noticed the astonished stares. Unsure of what social faux paus she\u2019d perpetrated, she looked away. Oliver was completely stunned. Arnold looked thoughtful. It was imperative the knights were treated as soon as possible, but to Rishe\u2019s dismay, no one was moving. \nDo they not trust me? That makes sense. Anyone would be reluctant to use medicine concocted by a complete stranger. But the longer we wait, the harder the poison will become to cure. \nShe needed to dispel their doubts. Rolling up her sleeve, Rishe approached Arnold and drew his sword from its scabbard. \u201cI need to borrow this for a moment, Your Highness.\u201d\n\u201cWhat are you\u2014\u201d\nShe pushed the blade against the soft skin of her inner arm. Blood welled up, along with the sharp sting of pain. Nothing compared to her injuries sustained during her life as a knight, though.\nArnold did not share her nonchalance. \u201cWhat do you think you\u2019re doing?!\u201d\nHe grabbed for her arm. She stepped out of his grasp. Was blood truly so shocking? She didn\u2019t have the time to worry about it. Clutching the overfull bowl, Rishe hurried back to the knights.\n\u201cDon\u2019t worry. This isn\u2019t poison,\u201d Rishe said. She demonstrated as much by drizzling it with a spoon over her own fresh wound. It stung. That meant the ingredients were working.\n\u201cThis is crushed liquori grass, luqua flowers, and carilya nuts. I\u2019ll swallow some if that\u2019s what it takes to prove it\u2019s safe.\u201d It was horribly bitter; she hoped it wouldn\u2019t come to that. \u201cThe paralysis will last for days. Please make up your mind quickly.\u201d\n\u201cMake up our mind?\u201d\n\u201cWill you allow me to cure the poison? Or would you rather drag paralyzed soldiers all the way to Galkhein? I suppose you could waste His Highness\u2019s time searching for a hunter\u2019s settlement to use their antidote.\u201d She smiled serenely. \u201cIt makes no difference to us. Right, Your Highness?\u201d\nIn the end, Rishe applied the antidote.\nThe recovery took a few hours. While they waited, Rishe picked herbs in the same meadow she\u2019d been gazing at with yearning from the carriage. A fortuitous turn of events. She found anti-inflammatory herbs and flowers to ease sour bellies, ingredients for curing headaches, and mushrooms for inducing slumber",
    "query_text": ". She wrapped them all up in a handkerchief.\nIn the meantime, Arnold dispatched a messenger to this region\u2019s lord, making arrangements to deliver the apprehended bandits. After coordinating with Oliver, he drifted over to Rishe.\n\u201cI see your interest in flowers is mercenary, rather than ornamental,\u201d he said, surveying the heaps of herbs gathered on the bank of the pond. He sat down beside her.\nWhen he didn\u2019t say anything more, Rishe went back to work plucking leaves from plants with valuable stems. The leaves had no medicinal effects, but they did make a decent broth. Slumber mushroom spores were a nuisance unless dried; they were spread out beside her in the sun.\nI wonder, would he be annoyed if I attached herbs to the roof of the coach? That would be unusual adornment for a crown prince\u2019s retinue, but"

Spring wildflowers had a soft and gentle smell. Rishe looked out the window at the forest spreading toward Galkhein, thinking of the rare native flowers going into bloom. She wished she could pick those as well, but that would cause too much delay. She gazed on wistfully.\nAfter watching her in silence for some time, Arnold said, \u201c"

    "prefix_text": " trying so hard,\u201d said one voice.\n\u201cAll the enthusiasm in the world won\u2019t make a difference,\u201d said another. \u201cWe\u2019re going to be the crown princess\u2019s maids, not you.\u201d\nThe first added, \u201cHey, are you even listening? Stop wasting your time!\u201d\nRishe heard a weak scream, followed by a thump, like a body hitting the ground. She broke into a run, finding a blonde girl sprawled in the dirt, surrounded by four other women.\n\u201cAre you all right?\u201d Rishe hurried over to help the girl up. Her maid\u2019s uniform\u2014a loose navy-blue dress with a white apron\u2014was smeared with mud. The others were dressed identically.\n\u201cWho are you?\u201d one of the girls snapped at Rishe. She had a mop of blazing-red hair. \u201cAnother newbie?\u201d\nAn understandable mistake. Rishe\u2019s dress was simple, free of ornamentation, and her hair was bound back in a ponytail to keep it out of the way. She was dust-streaked, sweaty, and carrying a bucket in her arms.\nTelling them who I am will be more trouble than it\u2019s worth. Her silence only angered the girls more.\n\u201cAre you one of the crown princess\u2019s maids? They\u2019ve been snatching up every new girl. Those pretty hands of yours don\u2019t look like they\u2019ve ever held a broom,\u201d said one of them.\n\u201cUnfortunately for you, we\u2019ve been working here three years, and we\u2019ll be the ones to serve Prince Arnold as the maids of his palace.\u201d\n\u201cCan you stand? Oh, good, it looks like you\u2019re not injured.\u201d Rishe helped the girl up out of the dirt. \n\u201cHey, don\u2019t ignore us!\u201d the redheaded maid shouted. \u201cYou\u2019ve got some nerve. If you want to make it here, you\u2019ll know your place! I doubt the two of you will last a week!\u201d\nRishe didn\u2019t respond, her attention snagging on something else. The redhead was carrying curtains, probably to bring them to the wash. Rishe stared at them so hard the maid began to shift uncomfortably. \u201cWhat\u2019s your problem?\u201d\n\u201cYou should wait to wash those,\u201d Rishe said.\nThe girl glared daggers at her. \u201cExcuse me? Are you telling me it\u2019s too late in the day? You really are an amateur! The light lasts longer in the spring, you know. And it\u2019s hot today. There\u2019ll be plenty of\u2014\u201d \n\u201cIt\u2019s going to rain, is all.\u201d\nThe maids exchanged glances. \u201cHow can you be so sure?\u201d\n\u201cLook at the clouds amassing. The butterflies and the bees are flying low. The moisture in the air will make the drying take longer.\u201d\n\u201cWhat?\u201d\nAnother maid spoke up in a soft voice. \u201cDiana, you were the one who said we should take the initiative to wash the bigger pieces. You said the crown prince would choose us for his household!\u201d\n\u201cStop putting the blame on me! This isn\u2019t my fault.\u201d An indignant flush crept over the redhead\u2019s face. \u201cThere\u2019s no way some upstart can tell what time it\u2019s going to rain! The weather is going to be fantastic all day. Come on, we\u2019re hauling these over to the wash!\u201d\nThe three girls meekly followed Diana.\nRishe sighed, turning to the blonde girl. \u201cAre you hurt?\u201d\n\u201cNo, I\u2019m fine.\u201d The girl\u2019s gaze darted around nervously. \u201cI\u2019m Elsie. Thank you for helping me.\u201d Her face was studiously blank, but from the way she struggled with her words, Rishe could tell she was being genuine.\n\u201cDon\u2019t worry about it,\u201d Rishe said. \u201cYour uniform seems to have fared less well.\u201d\n\u201cOh no.\u201d Elsie looked down at herself. Her face remained vacant, but she seemed sad. \u201cAnd I just got it.\u201d \n\u201cYou can get the dirt out if you wash it straight away. It\u2019s going to rain, but this dress should dry quickly. Use lots of soap, but don\u2019t scrub it by hand\u2014scrape the mud off with a brush.\u201d\n\u201cWhy a brush?\u201d\n\u201cBecause your fingers will just grind dirt into the threads. A brush is more porous.\u201d\nThe young sons of the family Rishe served spent their time tumbling in the dirt, and she had plenty of experience scraping mud out of clothes. She could even salvage dirty socks that had spent days crumpled in the corner.\n\u201cDo you\u2026 Are you\u2026\u201d Elsie trailed off, blinking rapidly a couple of times before finally looking Rishe in the eyes. \u201cAre you the crown princess\u2019s maid?\u201d\nUnsure how to answer, Rishe couldn\u2019t meet her eyes.\n \n***\n \nAfter parting ways with Elsie, Rishe returned to the detached wing with her fresh water. She put clean sheets on the bed the knights had installed, satisfied that she had a comfortable place to sleep. This room also had the highest-up balcony in the whole detached palace.\nTaking a break, she wandered out onto the balcony and looked off over the capital, the golden afternoon tinged with the onset of twilight. The day was fresh with a recent rain, the air clear enough to see for miles. The spring breeze felt good against her skin, sweaty from cleaning. Rishe leaned against the railing, leaning her head back and closing her eyes.\nShe felt like collapsing into bed immediately, but she desperately needed a wash. Still, she didn\u2019t want to pull herself away from the view and the breeze just yet. When she resumed gazing out absentmindedly, something her mother once said drifted back to her. \n\u201cRishe, there is no need for you to think for yourself.\u201d\nShe frowned, the memories coming thick and fast now.\n\u201cYou mustn\u2019t forget that the duty of our family is to live our lives fully devoted to the kings of the land. You\u2019re smart, but all the thinking in the world won\u2019t do a woman any good. You need only concern yourself with how best to serve the crown prince.\u201d\n\u201cStudies? Focus on social etiquette\u2014that\u2019s what you need for navigating high society. The crown prince\u2019s bride must be flawless. Your smile is lacking. You must always strive to appear amiable.\u201d\nRishe breathed out a long sigh. When I was fifteen, their lectures were the only thing I thought about.\nHer parents preached constantly. \u201cA woman\u2019s true happiness is to marry a suitable man and give birth to his heirs.\u201d\n\u201cBut, Mother\u2026\u201d\nObjection was not permitted. Any argument was immediately dispensed with. As a woman, Rishe could not inherit her father\u2019s title. Her only value was in her marriage. \nDespite knowing now that the opinions of others were as worthless as empty titles, the words still echoed in her memories.\nRishe\u2019s fingertips twitched, and she opened her eyes. Unmoving, she said, \u201cShouldn\u2019t you be seeing to your duties?\u201d\n\u201cMore hidden depths, I see,\u201d came a voice tinged with pleasure. Rishe straightened and turned. There was Arnold, leaning against the door to the balcony. \u201cYou seem able to sense my approach no matter how far or how hard I try.\u201d\n\u201cYou\u2019re quite naughty, aren\u2019t you? You\u2019ve been making your presence known little by little, emanating threat, to see how quickly I catch on.\u201d\n\u201cSo you noticed that as well.\u201d Arnold joined Rishe on the balcony. She tensed, but all he did was cast a curious glance at the view. \u201cWhat were you looking at?\u201d\n\u201cThe city.\u201d Rishe was hardly going to tell him she\u2019d been looking at nothing, merely ruminating on her mother\u2019s overbearing advice. The view from the balcony was spectacular, though. \u201cWhat\u2019s that over there?\u201d\n\u201cYou mean the library? The state invested funds to expand it. We have books from all over the world.\u201d\n\u201cReally? You have a library that big?\u201d Rishe\u2019s eyes sparkled with delight. She pointed out another building. \u201cWhat about that spire? It\u2019s beautiful.\u201d\n\u201cThe church and clock tower. The bells ring out the hour.\u201d\n\u201cOoh, how wonderful! And it looks like there\u2019s a rather big market there too?\u201d\n\u201cYes, the largest market in the city. Carts line up in the early morning. Most of the offerings are made fresh every day.\u201d\n\u201cAmazing! And what about that pretty mountain over there?\u201d\nRishe tried and failed to contain her excitement. She couldn\u2019t help but imagine what seeing all these places up close would be like. The grand library, the beautiful church that told the time, and the morning market with fresh, delicious food\u2014she wanted to experience it all.\nSeeing Arnold\u2019s bemused face, she said, \u201cWhat?\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m just wondering where all this interest is coming from,\u201d he said. \u201cYou were so reluctant to come, yet here you are, brimming with curiosity for my city.\u201d\n\u201cWell\u2026\u201d she trailed off, unsure of how to respond.\nWhat should I say? Should I just tell him the truth?\nThis wasn\u2019t a secret, but talking about her hopes and dreams to the man who had killed her was a little awkward. A strange self-consciousness settled on her, her cheeks heating as she mumbled, \u201cBecause I\u2019ve always wanted to.\u201d\nArnold looked at her keenly. \u201cWanted to what?\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019ve always wanted to come here.\u201d\nDuring her life as a merchant, Rishe developed her single dream to visit everywhere in the world. That dream was cut tragically short when only one country remained: Galkhein.\nIn each of her consecutive lives, Rishe\u2019s priority became staying alive. Every time, without fail, just as she found her footing, the world was plunged into chaos. She never had the chance to see Galkhein. This betrothal was her chance. \u201cIt\u2019s probably why I agreed to marry you,\u201d she added after a moment\u2019s hesitation.\nArnold swept a tepid glance over the city. \u201cThere\u2019s nothing here worth seeing.\u201d\n\u201cThat\u2019s not true! The places you just told me about sound amazing! Your citizens are clean and happy, your knights are proper and kind. Oh, and another\u2014\u201d \nRishe broke off enumerating Galkhein\u2019s charms as Arnold turned to look at her. His face was impassively calm, but something seemed to pass by underneath, like a shadow in deep water.\n\u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d Rishe said. \u201cDid I say something odd?\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m just amazed you could be so unaware of yourself.\u201d \nWh-what a rude thing to\u2014\n\u201cI\u2019ve never met anyone like you. No one has ever spoken to me the way you do. I don\u2019t know any girls of your class with the knowledge or the physical abilities you possess. Noblewomen don\u2019t concern themselves with such things.\u201d\nRishe, there is no need for you to think for yourself.\nShe frowned. \u201cPerhaps you\u2019re right, but everything I\u2019ve learned is precious to me. No one can take my skills away\u2014I value them with my life. Some may say that my knowledge is worthless, but it makes no difference to me.\u201d She turned from the balcony, fixing him with a piercing gaze. \u201cI\u2019m the one who decides what I value.\u201d\nRishe had clawed free of her mother and father\u2019s indoctrination a long time ago. Man, woman\u2014it didn\u2019t matter. She could do anything. Being queen was not the culmination of her life; she wouldn\u2019t trade her freedom for anything.\nArnold matched her intensity. \u201cYou\u2019re right.\u201d He gently cupped her cheek in a one hand, swiping his thumb along the line of her jaw, smearing dust. \u201cLive your life here however you wish. I vow to do my utmost to protect you.\u201d\n\u201cHuh?\u201d\nHis vehemence took her by surprise. Arnold had every right to demand she act the part of a proper consort. This was a political marriage; Rishe was essentially a hostage, after all. Yet here he was, cosigning her misbehavior. Moreover, he was all but swearing to defend her from the consequences.\n\u201cWhy?\u201d\n\u201cYou know why. I\u2019m enamored with you.\u201d Arnold fed her the same line. \u201cI know you said you don\u2019t care about other people\u2019s approval, but I like your asymmetrical talents. I don\u2019t find them useless at all.\u201d \nRishe didn\u2019t know how to respond.\n\u201cI thought I\u2019d already made that clear.\u201d He took his hand back, drawing away, stopping just on the threshold. He turned back to a stunned Rishe and said, \u201cLet me know if there\u2019s anything you desire. I realize I just broke our agreement\u2014the one about not touching you.\u201d\nAnd with that, he was gone.\nShaken, Rishe sank to the floor of the balcony. I can\u2019t predict him at all! Just what is Arnold Hein planning?\nThe quiet of evening fell over the imperial capital of Galkhein.\n \n***\n \n\u201cMmm.\u201d\nSunshine streamed through the window as Rishe roused from sleep. She rolled over, basking in the morning light. The wall she expected wasn\u2019t there, and the bed seemed larger than usual. Taking advantage of it, she stretched out as far as she could.\nWas this her chamber at home? Or maybe she was a merchant again, spending a night at the desert king\u2019s palace. Perhaps this was her bed of straw from her life as a maid? Her memories met and interwove as she drifted into wakefulness.\nWhen Rishe finally opened her eyes, she grew even more confused.\nLight blue curtains surrounded the bed, thin enough to allow sunlight to pass through. She pulled them aside to find herself in a bare room devoid of furniture and carpet.\nOh, right. She didn\u2019t need to report for morning training, tend to her herb garden, prepare breakfast, or see how the bottles she had brewed overnight were coming along.\nRealizing that, Rishe buried her face in the pillow. \u201cSo soft,\u201d she murmured. \nJudging by the position of the sun, it was about six o\u2019clock in the morning. She was pretty sure she had gone to bed around midnight last night.\nI slept for six whole hours? Rishe couldn\u2019t believe it. Generally, she was used to getting about four hours of sleep. On bad days, at the height of an emergency as a knight or apothecary, she wouldn\u2019t even get that much. \nI\u2019ve got nothing but cleaning on the schedule today. Hostages can sleep in, right? At least a little? Excitement suffused her at the thought, but that was interrupted by a knock on the door.\n\u201cLady Rishe, are you awake? It\u2019s Oliver\u2014Prince Arnold\u2019s attendant.\u201d\nRishe sat up with a start. \u201cI\u2019m awake!\u201d\nOliver continued to speak through the door. \u201cI apologize for bothering you at such an early hour. I\u2019m here with a delivery.\u201d\n\u201cJust a moment!\u201d Rishe slipped out of the bed, dressed quickly, and tugged the bed\u2019s canopy closed. She opened the door to find Oliver standing in the hallway with a polite smile.\nHe apologized again. \u201cThis was the only time I could slip away from His Highness\u2019s office. I\u2019m glad to see that you\u2019re already dressed.\u201d\n\u201cNot at all.\u201d Rishe paused, stepping back to allow him inside. \u201cOh my. You look exhausted.\u201d\nOliver grimaced. \u201cIs it that obvious? We\u2019ve been climbing through mountains of paperwork, but never mind me. His Highness has been working around the clock.\u201d\nRishe thought back to yesterday, how he had come all the way out to the balcony. He should have used that spare time to sleep. \u201cHe\u2019s in high demand, isn\u2019t he? He was even working on the trip over.\u201d\n\u201cHe finished all the work he brought along with us,\u201d Oliver confirmed. \u201cNow he\u2019s dealing with everything that piled up during his visit to Hermity.\u201d\n\u201cOh.\u201d Rishe grimaced in sympathy. He may have killed her in a past life, but she wouldn\u2019t wish the bureaucracy of kingship on anyone. \u201cIt\u2019s a shame he had to put his work on hold to attend a silly engagement party.\u201d\n\u201cNo matter. That party was how a committed bachelor finally found a bride.\u201d\nHis smile was sincere, but Rishe knew better. She spread her arms. \u201cGo on. Shall I spin around so you have a better view?\u201d\nOliver blinked. \u201cI beg your pardon?\u201d\n\u201cYou\u2019re looking me over like I\u2019m a horse for sale. If there\u2019s anything I can help you with, please let me know.\u201d\nOliver\u2019s brows went up. He let out a little breath of resignation. \u201cHis Highness was right. You do possess the keen perception of a knight. Of course, I\u2019m purely an amateur myself.\u201d\nI\u2019d say this was a merchant\u2019s sixth sense, rather than battle intuition.\nThis wasn\u2019t the first time Rishe had caught Oliver looking at her. It reminded her of the way her noble customers would examine a product, assessing worth and authenticity. Or a merchant weeding out potential merchandise from a wide array of choices.\nIn other words, he was appraising her.\nOliver moved into a deep, sweeping bow. \u201cMy sincerest apologies, my lady. I have been unaccountably rude to my lord\u2019s consort. My behavior was unacceptable.\u201d\nRishe shook her head. \u201cPlease don\u2019t, it\u2019s fine.\u201d It wasn\u2019t unreasonable for the prince\u2019s closest attendant to be wary of strangers. But it did make her curious. \u201cHow long have you worked for Arnold? Have you always been a valet?\u201d\n\u201cI trained as a squire, actually,\u201d Oliver replied. \u201cBut I was injured and dismissed from the order. His Highness took me into his household soon after. I have served him for nearly a decade.\u201d\n\u201cThen maybe you can answer this,\u201d Rishe said. \u201cWhy is Prince Arnold so very intent on making me his wife?\u201d\nOliver hesitated, as if weighing the pros and cons of speaking, \u201cTo be quite honest, I",
    "query_text": " was as surprised as you were. He\u2019s always insisted he had no interest in marriage. But the sight of you in Hermity has changed his mind. Apparently.\u201d\nSo not even his attendant understood his motives. Rishe remained at a complete loss.\n\u201cIf I may, however?\u201d Oliver mistook Rishe\u2019s confusion for anxiety and added, \u201cI have served Prince Arnold for a long time, and never before have I seen him so happy. When he is with you, he laughs. His smiles are sincere.\u201d\nRishe was taken aback. She\u2019d figured all of Arnold\u2019s laughter and teasing was at her expense. His own private jokes.\n\u201cAre you\u2026unhappy with him?\u201d Oliver ventured. \u201cWith his looks, His Highness is exceedingly popular with the ladies of the court, you know.\u201d\n\u201cI"

    "prefix_text": " through that.\u201d\n\u201cWell, I already went to the trouble of getting ready.\u201d Rishe plucked at her soft blue dress, draped in fluttering layers around her like a flower bud. She\u2019d braided her hair, decorating it with accessories. Her makeup was light, her shoes polished to a mirror shine. Her only jewelry was a pair of pearl earrings.\n\u201cRishe\u2026\u201d\n\u201cYour Highness, the court may consider my status as a captive princess shameful in the extreme, but I don\u2019t.\u201d She\u2019d chosen this course, after all.\nArnold was again watching her with a mixture of wonder and confusion.\n\u201cSo don\u2019t worry,\u201d she said, extending her hand. \u201cFeel free to show off your fianc\u00e9e.\u201d\nArnold relented, his dashing smile creeping out once again. \u201cVery well. I should take advantage of this opportunity to touch my betrothed.\u201d\n\u201cWe\u2019re wearing gloves.\u201d\nArnold took Rishe\u2019s hand.\nA throng of guests was gathered in the ballroom as a group of musicians performed on a platform. Women in gowns stood clustered, while gentlemen in military attire grouped together. A mere glance was enough to tell their clothes were of the highest quality. They mingled happily, making small talk with glasses in hand.\nRishe let her hand rest on Arnold\u2019s arm as she paused at the threshold to take it all in. \u201cThis is a bigger event than I was expecting.\u201d\n\u201cIs it? I\u2019d say it\u2019s a rather small gathering, actually.\u201d\n\u201cMaybe for a military powerhouse,\u201d Rishe muttered. \nYet another reminder of Galkhein\u2019s wealth took her off guard. Arnold just looked bored.\n\u201cThe size doesn\u2019t matter,\u201d he said. \u201cIn the end, they\u2019re only here for gossip. Look, here they come.\u201d\nIn the blink of an eye, they were surrounded by guests.\n\u201cPrince Arnold, thank you for gracing us with an invitation,\u201d said one man. \u201cSuch a pleasure.\u201d \n\u201cThe pleasure is mine, Lord Abel,\u201d Arnold drawled.\n\u201cYour Highness! We were so glad to hear of your safe return,\u201d another guest chirped. \u201cPlease, our daughter is simply dying to be regaled with tales of your trip.\u201d\n\u201cI can\u2019t imagine I\u2019d have anything particularly exciting to share with her,\u201d Arnold said curtly.\nAfter the last few days, Rishe found this look of glazed apathy disturbing. His good looks only compounded it\u2014he was so handsome that every expression was stark.\nHe looks more like Emperor Arnold Hein now, but still not the same.\nArnold appeared to notice her watching him. When he looked at her, his sourness disappeared, replaced by a genuine smile. All around him, women found themselves flushing. Arnold paid no heed to their fervent gazes, instead leaning in to give Rishe a brief moment of consideration.\nThen he leaned in close enough to kiss her.\n\u201cA dull trip,\u201d he said again, pulling away. \u201cBut fortuitous. Without it, I would have never met the woman destined to be my wife.\u201d\nA shocked murmur rolled through the crowd. Rishe, who hadn\u2019t recovered from seeing Arnold\u2019s beautiful face at close range, barely noticed the looks of utter loathing the assembled women were throwing her.\n\u201cH-His Highness is smiling? At his hostage bride?\u201d\n\u201cHe called her his wife?! He\u2019s never even looked at us!\u201d\nThey were whispers, but they carried.\nA portly man stepped forward with his daughter in tow. \u201cYour Highness, do you mean to say that this lovely young woman is your fianc\u00e9e?\u201d\nEvery eye in the ballroom was on Rishe, alight with curiosity, envy, or schemes. None of them could hide their contempt. But Rishe didn\u2019t falter.\nThis is nothing compared to being publicly dumped in a banquet hall. And I\u2019ve done that seven times!\nShe offered a polite smile and an astoundingly correct curtsy. Left leg at a diagonal behind the right, back straight, head bowed. \u201cHow do you do? My name is Rishe Irmgard Weitzner.\u201d\nEven the most hostile guests could find nothing impolite in her greeting, no sign of rough manners from the rustic daughter of a backwater nation. Rishe had years of training in expectation of ascending to the throne. Occasionally, habits from her other lives slipped through, but Arnold appeared to be the only one who noticed.\nNow he was looking at her with satisfaction. \u201cLady Rishe has only just arrived, and her acquaintances are few and far between. I hope I can count on you all to hold me accountable should I prove an incompetent husband.\u201d\n\u201cB-but of course, Your Highness.\u201d\n\u201cCome, Rishe.\u201d Arnold guided her out of the ring of spectators. The stares continued to follow them as they walked away.\nRishe dropped her voice to a whisper. \u201cYou sure know how to invite the ire of women.\u201d\n\u201cWhatever do you mean?\u201d\n\u201cThe way you harped on about me. Everything you said was tailor-made to stoke their jealousy. You\u2019ve gained me enemies, so thanks for that.\u201d\nArnold snorted. \u201cEverything I said was to protect you from enemies. They need to know you aren\u2019t just some trophy they can eliminate without recourse. We need to show them this to forestall any potential moves against you in the future.\n\u201cShow them what, exactly?\u201d\n\u201cThat I\u2019ll protect you no matter what.\u201d\nHe said it with such nonchalance that it brought her up short. Protect me? Arnold Hein, protect me?\nSuch an ironic position to take. She couldn\u2019t tell him that, of course. Her response came out somewhat strangled. \u201cI doubt they\u2019ll be anything to worry about. In fact, the biggest threat facing me is you.\u201d\n\u201cOh? And why do you say that?\u201d\n\u201cFor many reasons, the most obvious being that I\u2019m no match for you with a blade.\u201d As much as it pained her to admit it.\nArnold looked pleased. \u201cPerhaps we should duel.\u201d\n\u201cYes, please! And if it wouldn\u2019t be an intrusion\u2014I would like to train with you.\u201d If she studied him, she could learn his strategies and his attack patterns. She\u2019d never be a match in speed or raw power, but any insight would be invaluable.\n\u201cSure.\u201d Arnold shrugged. \u201cI don\u2019t mind.\u201d\n\u201cTruly?\u201d Her eyes glittered with anticipation.\nHe chuckled. \u201cYour answers never disappoint me.\u201d\n\u201cWhat\u2019s that supposed to mean? Oh, it looks like they\u2019re playing a new song.\u201d\nA soft melody drifted across the hall. The crowd divided, heading toward the center of the floor or against the wall. The next dance was starting, and everyone was waiting to see what the crown prince and his new fianc\u00e9e would do.\n\u201cWe don\u2019t have to dance if you don\u2019t want to,\u201d Arnold said.\n\u201cOh? As it happens, I like dancing.\u201d Plus, she couldn\u2019t resist a blatant challenge. She offered him her hand.\n\u201cVery well, then.\u201d Arnold only hesitated for a moment before taking it and steering her gently to an empty spot on the floor. He didn\u2019t seem like the dancing type, but his movements were slick and effortless. Facing one another, they joined hands. Arnold wrapped his other arm around her waist. \nOoh. His hand felt huge against her back. She realized she was breathing a little faster. They\u2019d never been this close before.\nNo, that isn\u2019t quite true. This is the second time. Rishe\u2019s final memories from her last life flashed vividly through her mind.\nThis was indeed the second time they had been this close\u2014the first had ended with a sword through her chest.\nEmperor Arnold Hein had single-handedly decimated the knights in the castle. Rishe stood in the midst of the carnage, breath ragged as she gripped the hilt of her sword, slick with her own blood. She was the last line of defense. The chamber behind her housed the royal family.\nIf they could reach the hidden passageways, the young prince and his party could find shelter with their allies across the border. Rishe and the other knights were prepared to sacrifice their lives to allow the royal family to survive. Their escape meant victory.\nBells tolled out, urging flight. All is lost. Run. Rishe managed to graze Arnold\u2019s cheek with her blade before she looked down to find his jet-black sword blooming out of her chest.\nShe remembered how it burned, as if the blade was made of fire. It was heat, not pain, but her breathing grew labored, and when Emperor Arnold Hein withdrew his sword, Rishe crumpled. \nHe knelt by her side and whispered something.\nThe words were seared into her memory. Rishe squeezed Arnold\u2019s hand as they danced.\nI\u2019ll be the bully this time. \nRishe shifted her weight back, slipping out of the hold on her waist. She broke Arnold\u2019s lead and spun, drifting on the harmony of the dance. She took him by surprise; his eyes went wide.\nI wonder what you\u2019ll do when you\u2019re no longer on top, Your Highness. Her smile was a declaration of war. Watching him attempt to follow her lead would be delightful. She pulled his hand toward her, attempting to move them into a spin.\nBut Arnold held fast. He planted his hand on her waist and turned them in a different direction, using her inertia against her. Hey! As a result, Rishe twirled by herself on the spot.\nShe didn\u2019t miss a step. She turned elegantly, the hem of her dress whispering across the ballroom floor. She heard appreciative murmurs from the wallflowers lined up watching.\nDespite that, Rishe took it as a defeat. Round one to Arnold. \nSo\u2026you can think on your feet. How about this?\nArnold remained unruffled, evading her next scheme like it was nothing. He grinned down at her, his eyes shining with a dare.\nHe thinks I can\u2019t beat him. His ease vexed her, but it was his smugness that made her angry.\nShe let out a hard breath, attempting a maneuver to lure him in while turning. He leaned back, not falling for it at all.\nHe\u2019s just too good at changing his center of gravity! She kept her astonishment under wraps, but she felt it. Despite how close we\u2019re dancing, I can\u2019t throw off his timing at all. He\u2019s sidestepped all my attempts, and he takes back the lead the second I let down my guard!\nIt made her increasingly angry. She twirled and stepped as the dance dictated, all the while feeling out for moments of weakness. Arnold played along with her game, completely unruffled.\nEvery single time. I\u2019m doing my utmost to trip him up, but he doesn\u2019t even seem annoyed! At this point she\u2019d just settle for any reaction at all.\nTheir unusual dance style had gathered a crowd. Rishe paid them no mind, focused only on her goal. Then something occurred to her, and her breath caught in her throat.\nWait a minute, he has left an opening. It\u2019s the same one from before. She thought back to their fight to the death, to that moment when she had managed to draw blood. That may indeed have been his only weakness.\nIf I strike the same way\u2014huh? Before she could try, Arnold appeared to lose patience, wrapping his arm around her waist. He bent her back into a dip so deep it felt like he\u2019d pulled a carpet from under her feet. She yelped, grabbing at him reflexively, clinging tight. His big hands gripped her securely enough to mitigate the sensation of falling. Relief flooded through her, and she felt a laugh rumble against her ear.\nThe music came to an end with one last ringing note. She blinked. The dance is over?\nA hush fell over the ballroom. Then cheers broke out, followed by a round of applause.\n\u201cThat was incredible!\u201d\nThe watching nobles crowded in.\n\u201cYou two moved in such perfect harmony!\u201d\n\u201cI was on the edge of my seat. I felt like I was watching a sword duel!\u201d\n\u201cIs this a dance from Hermity? I\u2019ve never seen such steps before.\u201d\n\u201cUh, well\u2026\u201d Rishe floundered. She glanced up at Arnold, who appeared to be enjoying her struggle. She\u2019d get no help from him.\nRishe dealt with the barrage of questions as best she could, letting the crowd sweep them into the dining room, which was set up for a buffet-style meal. She made sure to greet every guest, riveting their faces into her memory.\nShe must have been acting peculiar, because Arnold eventually said, \u201cRishe, I think the wine is getting to you. Shall we get some fresh air?\u201d\nRishe hadn\u2019t touched a single drop. In fact, she\u2019d been caught up in so many conversations that she hadn\u2019t even had the chance to eat, but she had experience working on an empty stomach. She accepted Arnold\u2019s encouragement as the escape it was.\nJust when I least expect it, he\u2019ll act the gentleman. Maybe he\u2019d remembered her demand for a carefree life of doing nothing.\nRishe cast a charming look across the crowd. \u201cThank you for your consideration, Your Highness. Forgive me.\u201d She gave a polite bow before quietly slipping away. \nShe didn\u2019t head straight to the balcony but rather slowly walked around the hall. There was only so much she could find out glued to Arnold\u2019s side all night.\nI need information. Galkhein\u2019s political landscape was a mystery to me through all",
    "query_text": " my past lives. I only know the rumors that made it abroad.\nAlthough she knew of Arnold\u2019s eventual patricide, she had no concept of the circumstances leading up to it. She needed a better picture of the factions and power balance inside the court. The lives these people led.\nI know better than to believe wartime gossip. This Arnold Hein is a lot different from what I\u2019d heard he was like at nineteen. He\u2019s not as diabolical as the rumors led me to believe. He likes to push, but he isn\u2019t unkind. The thought drifted across her mind, leaving her conflic"

And then to go on to wield a sword so skillfully\u2014his suffering must have been immense.\n\u201cOnly a few people know about this injury. You\u2019re the first to notice on your own.\u201d\n\u201cHow did it happen?\u201d\nThat grim smile returned as he looked down at Rishe. With the moon hanging behind him, he was as opaque as ever, but Rishe understood the sentiment.\nI shouldn\u2019t pry.\nRishe pulled her hand away, and that ominous smile that sent chills down her spine disappeared. Arnold put his jacket back in order, reclasping it at the neck.\nSomeone tried to kill Arnold Hein about ten years ago. But who and why? Rishe cast her eyes down as she ruminated. The most obvious beneficiaries of a dead crown prince would be potential heirs and those loyal to them. I believe Arnold has a younger brother, but I haven\u2019t met him yet.\nOdd. Rishe might be a hostage, but shouldn\u2019t she meet her future relatives? Perhaps it was Arnold\u2019s doing and not the will of the imperial family themselves. He didn\u2019t seem to want to involve her in anything unless it was absolutely necessary\u2014he hadn\u2019t told her about this ball, after all. \nRishe looked up at him. \u201cYour Highness, may I select my maids some time over the next few days?\u201d \n\u201cVery well. I\u2019ll tell Oliver to make that a priority.\u201d\n\u201cAh, I can do the selection myself. We needn\u2019t trouble him.\u201d\nArnold arched an amused brow. Gone was that unsettling smile, replaced with his easy manner. \u201cWhat are you planning this time?\u201d\n\u201cOh, nothing important,\u201d Rishe said. She picked up her empty glass. \u201cI\u2019m merely concerned about the servants\u2019 working conditions.\u201d\nTo protect her life and well-being, she needed to keep from dying at twenty years old again. And to do that, she had to prevent Arnold Hein\u2019s war. Her best bet would be to appeal to the important people she\u2019d known in her past lives. People with influence.\nPlus, there was a mountain of things she needed to do in preparation for the marriage ceremony.\nI need to sow a plot of land, grow herbs, do lots of shopping, get cheap alcohol, and then\u2026 \nRishe began a to-do list that had nothing to do with war in the least.\n \n***\n \nAs the ball wound to a close, a lone boy stood in the gloomy courtyard of the imperial palace. He had soft black hair and round blue eyes. No older than sixteen, he had an androgynous grace to him, gaze fixed on the balcony above. \nHe was watching a girl.\nShe had coral-colored hair, and even from this distance, he could tell she was beautiful. She stood there alone, apparently waiting for someone. Whoever it was must have shown up because her hand slipped from the banister, and she stepped away. Not too long after, a man appeared where she had been standing.\nThe man turned a silent glare down into the garden, as if he\u2019d known the boy had been there the whole time, despite the shadows.\nA shiver ran down the boy\u2019s spine and he smiled reflexively, delighting in the intense aura of threat the man gave off. It was just a warning, it seemed, as the man abruptly turned on his heel and disappeared. \n\u201cAww, we can\u2019t play together either?\u201d The boy hung his head. \u201cI miss you, Brother.\u201d\nIt had to be the woman. The beauty. She\u2019d made the boy\u2019s life hell since the day she arrived. \nHis brother had prohibited him from attending balls like this one. That was fine; he\u2019d sooner avoid them altogether. Still, he\u2019d wanted to meet that girl. \n\u201cBut we\u2019ll meet soon enough, won\u2019t we?\u201d He spoke to himself in a soft voice. \u201cI\u2019ve got plans for you, Sister.\u201d \n\n(2) chapter number given is likely out of range: 0\nChapter: 8\n\nChapter 3\nChapter 3\n \n\u201cYOU\u2019RE ALL SO USELESS!\u201d Diana the redheaded maid\u2019s voice rang out inside the stone washhouse. \nThree days had passed since the afternoon Rishe shook off her guard and came out to the well. Rishe was once again dressed to fit in with the maids. At Diana\u2019s shout, she looked up without pausing in her work. \n\u201cIs even laundry beyond your capabilities? I asked you to wash these this morning, and now it\u2019s past noon! Meanwhile, we\u2019ve finished cleaning the entire first floor in a third of the time!\u201d\n\u201cI-I\u2019m sorry, Diana.\u201d\nThe new maids went silent with shame. Among them was Elsie, the girl Rishe stood up for the other day. Rishe pulled her",

I wish I had so much free time.\u201d\nHuffily, she turned from Rishe. \u201cLet\u2019s just ignore these useless fools. Laura, Maya. Come on. If we want to be chosen as Lady Rishe\u2019s maids, we mustn\u2019t waste our time.\u201d\nDiana took out a slip of paper from her pocket, smoothing it"

In her confusion, all she could do was stare.\nRishe hurried out of the ballroom, the impending threat of exile hanging over her and the prince\u2019s entreaties to halt ringing in her ears.\nThis is perfect! Now I can get it right! I\u2019ll grab everything valuable from my room.\nRishe had enjoyed her life as a merchant, but she had always felt a stirring of regret about this night. If only she\u2019d brought some funds from home, she would\u2019ve had the capital to establish her business much sooner!\nSpeaking of this regret always prompted disbelief from her customers, including the king of the desert. \u201cWhat? That\u2019s what you\u2019d want to do over?!\u201d\nWhen she arrived back at home on the night of her second life, Rishe grabbed her jewelry box and as many of the books her late grandmother had left her as she could carry, then made haste to the forest to meet the caravan. But the stop at her house took time, and she missed them completely.\nIn that moment, Rishe made a stark realization. Different choices meant different mistakes. Opening one door would close another.\nAnd so the easy path to a life in commerce was closed to her.\nSure, she could try to build her business from the ground up, but personal connections were almost as essential to being a merchant as business savvy. It just wasn\u2019t realistic without a single acquaintance. \nSorting through her belongings in resignation, she came across a foreign encyclopedia of herbs among her grandmother\u2019s books. Taking it as a sign, Rishe sold her jewels elsewhere and used the funds to cross the sea and pursue the study of medicine.\nFortunately, Rishe retained all her knowledge from her previous life. She remembered that certain expensive herbs could be acquired cheaply in other regions. When word spread of a disease running rampant in a neighboring country, she recalled that too. This foreknowledge proved invaluable, as did her wide travel and exposure to many different teachers with many different points of view.\nAs such, Rishe led a successful life as an apothecary. She saved a feeble prince, synthesized a number of rare medicines with her mercantile knowledge, and thus spent her days in the simple joy of helping those in need.\nUnfortunately, all the joy in the world couldn\u2019t stand up to an epidemic. Thus ended her second life. \nOnce again, she found herself in the moment of her broken engagement, the curtain rising on the third loop. Her next four lives proceeded much the same way. As a skilled lady\u2019s maid, she helped a young noblewoman to a fortuitous marriage. Once, she even disguised herself as a man and became a knight. Every life was worth living, and she enjoyed them all. She enjoyed living, period.\nThere was just one problem.\nNo matter what I do, I die at twenty.\nShe enjoyed her lives, but she was not permitted to do so for long. With this time limit always hanging over her, she spent each loop in a state of constant activity.\nI would love to take it easy for a while. Is a little leisure time too much to ask? Obviously I don\u2019t want to die either! This time, I\u2019ll make as much money as I can in the first five years. Then, when I turn twenty, I\u2019ll live a life free of worldly cares. I\u2019ll do whatever\u2019s necessary to stay alive!\nHer mind made up, Rishe began her seventh life in a dead sprint through the palace. Regardless of her future plans, she was in a race against time. She needed to beat the messenger bearing news of her scandal.\nAs she ran, she yanked off her hair ornaments; she planned to sell them and didn\u2019t want to risk losing one. Her hair billowed out behind her, falling in loose waves.\nSuddenly, an idea occurred to her, one she hadn\u2019t had in any of her previous six lives.\nLeaving through the palace gardens would be faster. I can climb down a tree from the balcony.\nRishe had gone to war as a knight in the life just before this one. After the punishing battlefield training, climbing trees was nothing.\nSeamlessly, she changed direction. She raced for the balcony, where she ran into something at full speed.\n\u201cBwargh!\u201d Rishe let out a very unladylike grunt, staggering a few steps. She looked up to see what she\u2019d bounced off of. \u201cOh\u2026\u201d\nAn exceptionally handsome man stood in her path.\nHe had refined, patrician features and cruel, thin lips. He was slender yet powerful; even through his clothes, Rishe could tell his body was well conditioned. His jet-black hair covered his ears, creeping down to the nape of his neck. The tips of his locks bounced with his movements. They looked to be soft to the touch.\nFrom head to toe, he",

He\u2019s grinning like a boy getting into a scrape.\nThat attack had been good-natured as well, almost playful. It had muscle behind it but certainly not any lethal intent. He\u2019d just wanted to force Rishe to catch the blow. She found it unbelievable that he could exude such an overpowering air of menace when he was just messing around.\nWhile Rishe was focused on Arnold, Mary and Dietrich caught up, seemingly recovered.\n\u201cExcuse me, my lord!\u201d Mary squeaked. \u201cI-I-I don\u2019t know who you are, but kindly step away from Lady Rishe!\u201d\n\u201cYes, do as she says! Who the hell are you, anyway?!\u201d\nDon\u2019t tell me Prince Dietrich doesn\u2019t recognize one of his personal guests.\nDietrich\u2019s interests did not lean toward diplomacy; he likely hadn\u2019t bothered to introduce himself to Arnold. Mary, for her part, seemed to grasp that Arnold wasn\u2019t ordinary. She stood up to defend Rishe, despite the tremble in her voice. In a better world, perhaps the two of them could have become friends.\n\u201cThat\u2019s your ex-fianc\u00e9?\u201d Arnold cocked a brow. \u201cHe\u2019s even worse than I imagined. Pathetic.\u201d\nDietrich flushed. \u201cI\u2019ll have your head!\u201d\n\u201cDietrich, I beg of you, contain yourself,\u201d Rishe said, then rounded on Arnold. \u201cAs for you, Your Highness\u2014you know who Dietrich is, and you know what speaking carelessly could mean. Are you trying to pick a fight?\u201d\n\u201cWhatever do you mean?\u201d Arnold\u2019s brows lifted high, making him the picture of innocence. \u201cBelieve me, Lady Rishe, every word I speak is chosen with extreme care.\u201d\nFinally realizing who Arnold was, Dietrich visibly paled. \u201cArnold? He\u2019s the crown prince of Galkhein?\u201d\nMary yelped. The knights stood down, shamefaced. The gossip-hungry neighbors who\u2019d gathered to witness a scandal play out drew back in fear.\n\u201cHe\u2019s the demon prince? The one who single-handedly destroyed a whole order of enemy knights?\u201d\n\u201cWatch your tongue, fool! Do you want him to do the same to you?\u201d\nThe two nations enjoyed peaceful relations, but Arnold remained the dreaded prince, heir to the throne of a former enemy. Current rumor wasn\u2019t as widespread as it would be in five years, but he was still regarded with distrust.\nThe onlookers stood rooted to the spot, too terrified to flee.\nWell, this has devolved into a full-fledged disaster.\nRishe heaved a frustrated sigh. \u201cPrince Arnold, to what do we owe this honor? Surely a crown prince would not draw his sword for a mere jest.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m here on business,\u201d Arnold said. \u201cBut first, I must beg forgiveness for my rudeness.\u201d\nHuh, what do you know? Once he became emperor, he\u2019d gladly behead any subject who so much as dared speak a word against him.\nI guess at nineteen he still knew how to apologize.\nIf that surprised her, Arnold\u2019s next act completely obliterated her sense of reality. \nWith a flourish, he fell to his knees. \n\u201cHuh?\u201d Is this actually happening? \nHe was a man destined for an imperial crown. A man who would stand at the head of a military powerhouse and spread his rule across continents.\nArnold, known for his frigid pride, knelt to the disgraced daughter of a duke.\nAnd not only that\u2014his head was bowed, looking nothing so much as a knight swearing allegiance to his lady. If it were anyone else, it would be a delightful, pious image. Instead, the assembled looked on in terrified awe.\nNot Rishe, though.\n\u201cWhat are you doing?\u201d she hissed. \u201cGet up!\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m apologizing for my baseless impertinence. Also, I\u2019m asking you\u2026\u201d He trailed off to take Rishe\u2019s hand, tugging her forward so forcefully she staggered. He gazed up at her.\nUgh. He\u2019s so beautiful. No matter how many times she looked at him, it didn\u2019t become any less disarming. Long eyelashes, arched brows, a noble nose. His bright blue eyes reminded her of the drift ice she\u2019d seen in a northern kingdom, gazing out from a ship in one of her past lives. She knew she was dwelling on this to buy time, even as the reality before her sank in.\n\u201c\u2026to become my wife.\u201d\nShe froze, unable to process the words. \u201cWhat?\u201d Rishe glanced around, desperately searching the faces of",
    "query_text": " the crowd. They all seemed as stunned as she felt. She looked down at Arnold again. \u201cYour wife?\u201d \n\u201cYes, that\u2019s right.\u201d\n\u201cYou want me to become your wife?\u201d\n\u201cYes.\u201d\nRishe couldn\u2019t speak. This was truly happening. It was real. It clicked into place in her head, and she let out a"

    "prefix_text": " the ground. In their midst stood Arnold, in the process of tripping another man into the dirt. He scowled, blade at the man\u2019s throat. \u201cIs that it, then?\u201d\n\u201cGwugh!\u201d\nArnold kicked the bandit in the stomach, eyes blazing with cruelty. \u201cThat\u2019s all the thrill you offer me after I went to the trouble of drawing my sword? Barely worth it. I\u2019m bored already.\u201d\nHe wasn\u2019t angry; on the contrary, he stared his enemies down with chilly disappointment, as if this had all been a letdown. Even Arnold\u2019s own knights seemed terrified of their master when he was in a mood. Arnold smoothly flicked the blood off his sword, wiping the blade on the bandit\u2019s shirt before sheathing it. The rest of the men on the ground seemed to be unconscious.\nWait, he didn\u2019t kill anyone? Why not? Is it because we haven\u2019t reached Galkhein?\nShe supposed even Arnold knew better than to go around killing the citizens of other countries. Or perhaps he had yet to become the ruthless monster she knew him as.\nArnold seemed to sense her gaze, turning around with a start. Genuine emotion bloomed on his face, worlds away from the blank mask he wore to face down the bandits. \u201cHow did you get out of the coach?\u201d\nRishe shrugged. \u201cIf I tell you, you\u2019ll be able to prevent me from doing it again.\u201d\nArnold snickered. \u201cYou continue to amaze me.\u201d\nHow can you go from ice-cold to suddenly looking like a normal nineteen-year-old? It\u2019s disconcerting. \nRishe fought down her disquiet as a man alighted from a coach and shouted, \u201cYour Highness! Not again!\u201d He was Oliver, one of the prince\u2019s attendants. He had silver hair and was roughly as tall as Arnold.\n\u201cWhat do you think all these knights are for, decoration? Why do you insist on endangering yourself?\u201d\nRishe had only met Oliver briefly a few days ago, but he didn\u2019t appear to be intimidated by Arnold at all. And, well\u2026he\u2019s not wrong.\nShe feared the menace would return to Arnold\u2019s expression, but he just looked annoyed. \u201cI could tell they were prepared to kill. I\u2019d prefer to take the burden on myself than risk multiple injuries so far afield. And we already have casualties.\u201d\nHe was right. Several injured knights leaned listlessly among the trees. Arnold issued orders to those still able-bodied. \u201cFirst squad, see to the wounded. Second squad, arrest these men.\u201d\n\u201cYes, sir!\u201d\nOliver appeared unsatisfied. \u201cYour Highness, that is a weak justification. I\u2019m overjoyed you\u2019re well, but you must consider Lady Rishe. Perhaps next time we run into a team of murderous brigands, you could allow your consort to remain in the coach.\u201d\n\u201cI told her to remain in the coach!\u201d\nRishe quickly averted her gaze, turning her attention to the wounded knights. They didn\u2019t appear badly injured, yet they all seemed exhausted.\n\u201cExcuse me, can I take a look?\u201d Rishe approached the knight acting as a medic. He looked round, startled by her presence.\n\u201cNonsense, my lady. Don\u2019t trouble yourself, you must have had quite a scare.\u201d\nThis was not unreasonable, but the wariness in his eyes made it clear he wanted her nowhere near his comrade. He isn\u2019t just being polite. He truly is on guard. \nBeside them, an injured knight groaned as another helped him up. \u201cWhat\u2019s wrong with you?\u201d the second knight asked the first. \n\u201cI-I feel\u2026numb.\u201d\n\u201cWhat? Damn.\u201d The knight grabbed up one of the fallen bandit\u2019s swords, going pale as he inspected the blade. \u201cYour Highness, look at this. Poison.\u201d\nArnold clicked his tongue. \u201cLocate every laceration and bind them close to the heart. Suck the poison from the wounds.\u201d\nHe mostly got that right, at least. In the meantime, Rishe located the nearest bound bandit and pulled his dagger out of its sheath. Its wet coating gleamed in the sunlight, just as the knight had said.\nThey applied the poison liberally\u2014whatever it is must be cheap and easily bought in bulk.\nShe wafted the smell toward her, bracing for something rancid, but detected nothing. Then she brought it closer to her nose.\nIt smells sweet, like an overripe apple. Shea grass and\u2026bluecap mushrooms. All the knights appear to have the same symptoms, so I won\u2019t have to check every blade.\nRishe stood back up and headed for the coach.\nOliver took a step after her. \u201cYour Highness, Lady Rishe is\u2014\u201d\n\u201cLeave her. She may do as she pleases.\u201d\n\u201cShe\u2019s well trained,\u201d Oliver mused. \u201cBut a battlefield is no place for a young lady. She probably wasn\u2019t prepared for such a dreadful spectacle.\u201d\nRishe ignored the murmurs and focused on her work. There they are. I\u2019ll take these, these, and\u2026\n\u201cThe poison must be a sleeping drug,\u201d she overheard Arnold saying. \u201cHunters use such drugs to weaken larger prey. I doubt this dose is lethal.\u201d\n\u201cBut it certainly is annoying,\u201d replied Oliver. \u201cWe\u2019re still two days out from Galkhein. Lugging a company of sleeping men in armor won\u2019t be pleasant.\u201d\n\u201cWe\u2019ll have to stop somewhere nearby. A hunter\u2019s settlement. Perhaps they will have an antidote\u2014\u201d\n\u201cExcuse me.\u201d Rishe, who\u2019d returned from the carriage, raised a hand. \u201cI have an antidote.\u201d\n\u201cWhat?\u201d\nThe entire company stared at her in awe.\n \n***\n \nAs it turned out, Arnold\u2019s guess was right. \nThis sweet-smelling substance was a hunter\u2019s drug, made from ingredients that were only toxic in their raw form. Heat rendered them harmless. Rishe had encountered this poison several times before, curing a customer afflicted with it during her life as an apothecary.\n\u201cA lethal dose for a grown man would fill a wine glass. They likely got less than a hundredth of that,\u201d Rishe explained to Arnold, not looking up from her work. \u201cStill, the numbness can block their airways with the roots of their tongues. It\u2019s best to lay them on their sides.\u201d\n\u201cYes, I understand the theory and the solution.\u201d Arnold gazed down at Rishe\u2019s hands. \u201cThe part I\u2019m struggling with is why you\u2019re the one telling me this.\u201d\n\u201cWell, I know how to make the antidote,\u201d Rishe said patiently as she muddled the herbs together in the white soup bowl she\u2019d borrowed for her flowers. She crushed them with the back of a spoon before adding another dried flower, crushing that as well, and combining them to form a paste. This process would be easier with a pestle, but she wasn\u2019t about to complain. \u201cThis poison is common\u2014it\u2019s cheap and easy to make, which often means the antidote is simple as well.\u201d\nThe antidote was synthesized, in fact, when hunters witnessed a deer showing no symptoms after eating a certain mushroom. They tested those along with other common herbs the deer ate. Rishe mentally thanked them for their scientific rigor as she added a bit of water, straining it all through a cloth.\nRishe stood up, brandishing the bowl of bright green medicine. \u201cBoiling would make the antidote more potent, but this works in a pinch.\u201d\nThat was when she noticed the astonished stares. Unsure of what social faux paus she\u2019d perpetrated, she looked away. Oliver was completely stunned. Arnold looked thoughtful. It was imperative the knights were treated as soon as possible, but to Rishe\u2019s dismay, no one was moving. \nDo they not trust me? That makes sense. Anyone would be reluctant to use medicine concocted by a complete stranger. But the longer we wait, the harder the poison will become to cure. \nShe needed to dispel their doubts. Rolling up her sleeve, Rishe approached Arnold and drew his sword from its scabbard. \u201cI need to borrow this for a moment, Your Highness.\u201d\n\u201cWhat are you\u2014\u201d\nShe pushed the blade against the soft skin of her inner arm. Blood welled up, along with the sharp sting of pain. Nothing compared to her injuries sustained during her life as a knight, though.\nArnold did not share her nonchalance. \u201cWhat do you think you\u2019re doing?!\u201d\nHe grabbed for her arm. She stepped out of his grasp. Was blood truly so shocking? She didn\u2019t have the time to worry about it. Clutching the overfull bowl, Rishe hurried back to the knights.\n\u201cDon\u2019t worry. This isn\u2019t poison,\u201d Rishe said. She demonstrated as much by drizzling it with a spoon over her own fresh wound. It stung. That meant the ingredients were working.\n\u201cThis is crushed liquori grass, luqua flowers, and carilya nuts. I\u2019ll swallow some if that\u2019s what it takes to prove it\u2019s safe.\u201d It was horribly bitter; she hoped it wouldn\u2019t come to that. \u201cThe paralysis will last for days. Please make up your mind quickly.\u201d\n\u201cMake up our mind?\u201d\n\u201cWill you allow me to cure the poison? Or would you rather drag paralyzed soldiers all the way to Galkhein? I suppose you could waste His Highness\u2019s time searching for a hunter\u2019s settlement to use their antidote.\u201d She smiled serenely. \u201cIt makes no difference to us. Right, Your Highness?\u201d\nIn the end, Rishe applied the antidote.\nThe recovery took a few hours. While they waited, Rishe picked herbs in the same meadow she\u2019d been gazing at with yearning from the carriage. A fortuitous turn of events. She found anti-inflammatory herbs and flowers to ease sour bellies, ingredients for curing headaches, and mushrooms for inducing slumber. She wrapped them all up in a handkerchief.\nIn the meantime, Arnold dispatched a messenger to this region\u2019s lord, making arrangements to deliver the apprehended bandits. After coordinating with Oliver, he drifted over to Rishe.\n\u201cI see your interest in flowers is mercenary, rather than ornamental,\u201d he said, surveying the heaps of herbs gathered on the bank of the pond. He sat down beside her.\nWhen he didn\u2019t say anything more, Rishe went back to work plucking leaves from plants with valuable stems. The leaves had no medicinal effects, but they did make a decent broth. Slumber mushroom spores were a nuisance unless dried; they were spread out beside her in the sun.\nI wonder, would he be annoyed if I attached herbs to the roof of the coach? That would be unusual adornment for a crown prince\u2019s retinue, but it wouldn\u2019t hurt to ask.\nShe realized, quite suddenly, that Arnold was looking at her. At her hands, specifically. He sat cross-legged with his chin propped on his fist, staring absently, like a kid watching a column of ants march by.\nWhat is so fascinating about herbs?\nTheir eyes met. \u201cAm I bothering you?\u201d he asked.\nRishe shook her head slowly. \u201cNot at all. I was just curious what caught your eye.\u201d\n\u201cNothing specific. I was just thinking how very unusual you are.\u201d He was smiling again. \u201cI\u2019m looking forward to how you\u2019ll surprise me next.\u201d\nLike I\u2019m some sort of rare pet he bought to entertain him. She didn\u2019t like that. Nothing she\u2019d done was at all remarkable\u2014normal tasks performed by a normal person.\n\u201cI didn\u2019t make that antidote for your amusement.\u201d\n\u201cI realize that.\u201d The instigating smile faded from his lips. \u201cYou know, those knights you coerced into taking your home-brewed medicine were all born in the slums.\u201d\n\u201cCoerced? That\u2019s hardly the word I\u2019d use.\u201d\n\u201cGalkhein claims to value merit above all else, but in the end, people are judged by where they came from. Despite this, those men fought their way up from nothing.\u201d\nRishe paused in plucking the seeds from a flower and looked up at Arnold.\n\u201cThe men with the worst cases of the paralysis were all newly assigned. They\u2019ve spent weeks training to ensure this mission was a success. That older knight\u2014the one who bowed to you\u2014sustained an injury protecting the rookies. He cares deeply about his men.\u201d\n\u201cYou seem to care about them too,\u201d Rishe commented.\n\u201cI handpicked them for my retinue.\u201d Arnold clambered to his feet, only to fall into a bow. \u201cAnd you kept them safe. You have my deepest gratitude.\u201d\nRishe found herself at a loss for words. Was this Arnold putting on a mask to hide the monster within? Or was this the real him? She remembered the way he\u2019d looked when he held his blade to the bandit\u2019s throat, like a child poised to break a toy he had grown bored of.\n\u201cDon\u2019t mention it,\u201d Rishe said, uncomfortable. \u201cI knew how to do it, so I did.\u201d\nArnold laughed softly. \u201cBe that as it may, I\u2019d still count a noblewoman who can brew remedies from wildflowers by the side of the road a rare find.\u201d\n\u201cEarlier, when you grabbed my wrist\u2026\u201d Rishe steered the subject away from her incongruous knowledge. \u201cYou broke your promise. You said you wouldn\u2019t touch me.\u201d\n\u201cThat was reflex,\u201d Arnold protested. \u201cI thought you were going to hurt yourself.\u201d\nSuch a simple conversation, so casual. It had Rishe feeling positively peculiar.\n\u201cWhy are your knights so wary around me?\u201d she asked. \n\u201cWary? Oh, they were all at the palace when you broke your first engagement. They\u2019re most likely concerned I\u2019m bringing home a villainous jilt who will lead to my ruin. Something silly like that.\u201d\n\u201cI see.\u201d Apparently, being dumped by a prince called into question one\u2019s herbalist abilities.\n\u201cI\u2019m glad you mentioned it,\u201d Arnold went on, \u201cbecause there may be people in Galkhein who will oppose our union. I will do everything in my power to protect you, but you must bring any insults or threats to me right away.\u201d\n\u201cAre there likely to be many?\u201d\n\u201cIn theory, the crown prince may choose his own wife, but the done thing is, of course, to marry a princess. I assume a duke\u2019s daughter would have at least some ties to the royal family?\u201d\nHe assumed correctly. She was in the family tree, if a rather distant branch.\n\u201cMy father has ordered me to choose a bride from a different kingdom rather than a woman of my own land because\u2014\u201d\n\u201cOne never knows when a hostage will come in handy,\u201d Rishe finished for him.\nGalkhein was an expansionist empire. Currently, peace reigned\u2014but peace was precarious. If Galkhein demanded any of the countries to hand over a princess bride, then none were in a position to refuse. With his daughter in the hands of a foreign power, no king would dare oppose a war that power cared to wage.\n\u201cI sent a message to my father telling him I happened upon a close relation of Hermity\u2019s king\u2014a duke\u2019s daughter who had been recently tossed aside by her fianc\u00e9e,\u201d Arnold said. \u201cI also may have implied I was the reason for your falling out\u2014yours and the prince\u2019s. Why, when I saw a woman so powerful and connected and beloved, I couldn\u2019t help but plunder you.\u201d\n\u201cPlunder me? That\u2019s certainly one way to describe it.\u201d Dietrich had kicked up an almighty fuss, despite being the one who broke the engagement.\n\u201cMy father approves of you because he sees you as a bargaining chip. There will be others who aren\u2019t prepared to accept you so willingly.\u201d\n\u201cIs that so?\u201d Rishe said steadily.\n\u201cNever fear,\u201d Arnold responded. \u201cThey\u2019ll eat their words, every one of them. They will receive you as their crown princess if they value their\u2014\u201d\n\u201cNo, being a hostage is perfect.\u201d \nArnold stared at her. \u201cHm?\u201d\n\u201cAs a hostage, I\u2019ll have no official duties, will I? We can pretend I\u2019m here only under great duress, and there will be no need for my comment on governmental or diplomatic affairs.\u201d\nArnold hesitated.",
    "query_text": " \u201cI suppose not.\u201d\n\u201cExcellent! Then I can live my dream of being utterly useless.\u201d Rishe trembled with delight. The thought of acting as an ambassador had really been weighing on her mind. Being a princess was nonstop work. Having been groomed for the position from an early age, Rishe knew members of the royal family barely even had time to sleep.\nBut prisoners didn\u2019t have places in government.\n\u201cThis is such a weight off my mind,\u201d Rishe admitted."

Rishe knew how exhausting and rigorous a maid\u2019s job was, how nerve-racking.\nShe refused to put the poor dears through such an ordeal for just a few days\u2019 stay. From the sound of things, the palace wasn\u2019t equipped with many housemaids. No doubt they already had their hands full.\n\u201cBesides, take a look.\u201d She held out her arms wide, gesturing to her sparkling clean floor. The knights stared at the bright room in admiration. \u201cCleaning a place with your own hands makes living there that much more satisfying, you see.\u201d\nThe knights smiled their awkward but good-natured agreement.\nRishe worked tirelessly, and before long, the chambers where she would spend the night were ready. The knights offered to carry in the bed, which she allowed.\nWhile they brought in furniture, Rishe started cleaning another room. She had run out of clean water, so she quietly slipped out to the well without informing the knights. It wasn\u2019t quite fair to them, but these were the palace grounds. Surely she didn\u2019t need to be chaperoned everywhere.\nBesides, they\u2019re guards in name only. They\u2019re clearly just here to report my movements to Arnold Hein, Rishe reflected as she walked through a courtyard full of flowers, bucket in hand. Iridescent butterflies cavorted playfully around her feet. He doesn\u2019t seem in a hurry to introduce me to the king. Although if I\u2019m just a hostage, that doesn\u2019t surprise me.\nShe hoped she got to meet the current emperor at least once. The future Arnold\u2019s violent conquest only began after he killed the man and made himself emperor, after all.\nI wonder what happened to Arnold Hein after I died in my past life. Did he reign supreme after winning his war? Or did some country manage to put a stop to his conquest? Whatever the case, I absolutely cannot allow him to start a conflict this time. Being the empress of a wartime nation sounds like so much work! The very thought is unacceptable!\nPerhaps they could divorce, but Rishe had a feeling that if Arnold decided to discard her in the middle of a war, she would fail in her mission to make it past the age of twenty. Better to avoid the situation all together.\nWait. When she thought about it, the cause of every single one of Rishe\u2019s deaths was Arnold and his war. I died fighting. I died when Galkhein\u2019s army invaded\u2026\nLooking at her six lives, all of them had ended in more or less the same way.\nRishe found herself crouched on the ground, cradling her head in her hands. Maybe we should get a divorce right now. But it wasn\u2019t in Rishe\u2019s nature to take back her decisions once she\u2019d made them. \nIf I leave, I\u2019ll probably just die in some war-related disaster again. If I can\u2019t live apart from him, I should take this opportunity to learn everything that I can. \nRishe didn\u2019t know the cause of her repeating lives, but there was no guarantee that the loops were infinite. She had to operate under the possibility that this life could be her last. This required some thought, but standing around seething with anxiety wouldn\u2019t help.\nRight now I\u2019ll focus on cleaning. Once the bath is here, I\u2019ll scrub off all the dust and travel exhaustion. And then I can finally relax! \nBrimming with new determination, she stood up and headed for the well. She was forestalled by the sound of jeering giggles. \n\u201cAww, look at the new girl, trying so hard,\u201d said one voice.\n\u201cAll the enthusiasm in the world won\u2019t make a difference,\u201d said another. \u201cWe\u2019re going to be the crown princess\u2019s maids, not you.\u201d\nThe first added, \u201cHey, are you even listening? Stop wasting your time!\u201d\nRishe heard a weak scream, followed by a thump, like a body hitting the ground. She broke into a run, finding a blonde girl sprawled in the dirt, surrounded by four other women.\n\u201cAre you all right?\u201d Rishe hurried over to help the girl up. Her maid\u2019s uniform\u2014a loose navy-blue dress with a white apron\u2014was smeared with mud. The others were dressed identically.\n\u201cWho are you?\u201d one of the girls snapped at Rishe. She had a mop of blazing-red hair. \u201cAnother newbie?\u201d\nAn understandable mistake. Rishe\u2019s dress was simple, free of ornamentation, and her hair was bound back in a ponytail to keep it out of the way. She was dust-streaked, sweaty, and carrying a bucket in her arms.\nTelling them who I am will be more trouble than it\u2019s worth. Her silence only angered the girls more.\n\u201cAre you one of the crown princess\u2019s maids? They\u2019ve been snatching up every new girl. Those pretty hands of yours don\u2019t look like they\u2019ve ever held a broom,\u201d said one of them.\n\u201cUnfortunately for you, we\u2019ve been working here three years, and we\u2019ll be the ones to serve Prince Arnold as the maids of his palace.\u201d\n\u201cCan you stand? Oh, good, it looks like you\u2019re not injured.\u201d Rishe helped the girl up out of the dirt. \n\u201cHey, don\u2019t ignore us!\u201d the redheaded maid shouted. \u201cYou\u2019ve got some nerve. If you want to make it here, you\u2019ll know your place! I doubt the two of you will last a week!\u201d\nRishe didn\u2019t respond, her attention snagging on something else. The redhead was carrying curtains, probably to bring them to the wash. Rishe stared at them so hard the maid began to shift uncomfortably. \u201cWhat\u2019s your problem?\u201d\n\u201cYou should wait to wash those,\u201d Rishe said.\nThe girl glared daggers at her. \u201cExcuse me? Are you telling me it\u2019s too late in the day? You really are an amateur! The light lasts longer in the spring, you know. And it\u2019s hot today. There\u2019ll be plenty of\u2014\u201d \n\u201cIt\u2019s going to rain, is all.\u201d\nThe maids exchanged glances. \u201cHow can you be so sure?\u201d\n\u201cLook at the clouds amassing. The butterflies and the bees are flying low. The moisture in the air will make the drying take longer.\u201d\n\u201cWhat?\u201d\nAnother maid spoke up in a soft voice. \u201cDiana, you were the one who said we should take the initiative to wash the bigger pieces. You said the crown prince would choose us for his household!\u201d\n\u201cStop putting the blame on me! This isn\u2019t my fault.\u201d An indignant flush crept over the redhead\u2019s face. \u201cThere\u2019s no way some upstart can tell what time it\u2019s going to rain! The weather is going to be fantastic all day. Come on, we\u2019re hauling these over to the wash!\u201d\nThe three girls meekly followed Diana.\nRishe sighed, turning to the blonde girl. \u201cAre you hurt?\u201d\n\u201cNo, I\u2019m fine.\u201d The girl\u2019s gaze darted around nervously. \u201cI\u2019m Elsie. Thank you for helping me.\u201d Her face was studiously blank, but from the way she struggled with her words, Rishe could tell she was being genuine.\n\u201cDon\u2019t worry about it,\u201d Rishe said. \u201cYour uniform seems to have fared less well.\u201d\n\u201cOh no.\u201d Elsie looked down at herself. Her face remained vacant, but she seemed sad. \u201cAnd I just got it.\u201d \n\u201cYou can get the dirt out if you wash it straight away. It\u2019s going to rain, but this dress should dry quickly. Use lots of soap, but don\u2019t scrub it by hand\u2014scrape the mud off with a brush.\u201d\n\u201cWhy a brush?\u201d\n\u201cBecause your fingers will just grind dirt into the threads. A brush is more porous.\u201d\nThe young sons of the family Rishe served spent their time tumbling in the dirt, and she had plenty of experience scraping mud out of clothes. She could even salvage dirty socks that had spent days crumpled in the corner.\n\u201cDo you\u2026 Are you\u2026\u201d Elsie trailed off, blinking rapidly a couple of times before finally looking Rishe in the eyes. \u201cAre you the crown princess\u2019s maid?\u201d\nUnsure how to answer, Rishe couldn\u2019t meet her eyes.\n \n***\n \nAfter parting ways with Elsie, Rishe returned to the detached wing with her fresh water. She put clean sheets on the bed the knights had installed, satisfied that she had a comfortable place to sleep. This room also had the highest-up balcony in the whole detached palace.\nTaking a break, she wandered out onto the balcony and looked off over the capital, the golden afternoon tinged with the onset of twilight. The day was fresh with a recent rain, the air clear enough to see for miles. The spring breeze felt good against her skin, sweaty from cleaning. Rishe leaned against the railing, leaning her head back and closing her eyes.\nShe felt like collapsing into bed immediately, but she desperately needed a wash. Still, she didn\u2019t want to pull herself away from the view and the breeze just yet. When she resumed gazing out absentmindedly, something her mother once said drifted back to her. \n\u201cRishe, there is no need for you to think for yourself.\u201d\nShe frowned, the memories coming thick and fast now.\n\u201cYou mustn\u2019t forget that the duty of our family is to live our lives fully devoted to the kings of the land. You\u2019re smart, but all the thinking in the world won\u2019t do a woman any good. You need only concern yourself with how best to serve the crown prince.\u201d\n\u201cStudies? Focus on social etiquette\u2014that\u2019s what you need for navigating high society. The crown prince\u2019s bride must be flawless. Your smile is lacking. You must always strive to appear amiable.\u201d\nRishe breathed out a long sigh. When I was fifteen, their lectures were the only thing I thought about.\nHer parents preached constantly. \u201cA woman\u2019s true happiness is to marry a suitable man and give birth to his heirs.\u201d\n\u201cBut, Mother\u2026\u201d\nObjection was not permitted. Any argument was immediately dispensed with. As a woman, Rishe could not inherit her father\u2019s title. Her only value was in her marriage. \nDespite knowing now that the opinions of others were as worthless as empty titles, the words still echoed in her memories.\nRishe\u2019s fingertips twitched, and she opened her eyes. Unmoving, she said, \u201cShouldn\u2019t you be seeing to your duties?\u201d\n\u201cMore hidden depths, I see,\u201d came a voice tinged with pleasure. Rishe straightened and turned. There was Arnold, leaning against the door to the balcony. \u201cYou seem able to sense my approach no matter how far or how hard I try.\u201d\n\u201cYou\u2019re quite naughty, aren\u2019t you? You\u2019ve been making your presence known little by little, emanating threat, to see how quickly I catch on.\u201d\n\u201cSo you noticed that as well.\u201d Arnold joined Rishe on the balcony. She tensed, but all he did was cast a curious glance at the view. \u201cWhat were you looking at?\u201d\n\u201cThe city.\u201d Rishe was hardly going to tell him she\u2019d been looking at nothing, merely ruminating on her mother\u2019s overbearing advice. The view from the balcony was spectacular, though. \u201cWhat\u2019s that over there?\u201d\n\u201cYou mean the library? The state invested funds to expand it. We have books from all over the world.\u201d\n\u201cReally? You have a library that big?\u201d Rishe\u2019s eyes sparkled with delight. She pointed out another building. \u201cWhat about that spire? It\u2019s beautiful.\u201d\n\u201cThe church and clock tower. The bells ring out the hour.\u201d\n\u201cOoh, how wonderful! And it looks like there\u2019s a rather big market there too?\u201d\n\u201cYes, the largest market in the city. Carts line up in the early morning. Most of the offerings are made fresh every day.\u201d\n",
    "query_text": "\u201cAmazing! And what about that pretty mountain over there?\u201d\nRishe tried and failed to contain her excitement. She couldn\u2019t help but imagine what seeing all these places up close would be like. The grand library, the beautiful church that told the time, and the"

Anything to stave off the outbreak of war.\nOliver had no idea what was going through Rishe\u2019s head. Brightly, he continued their conversation. \u201cThe ceremony will be held in three months\u2019 time. All preparations must be complete by then. And now\u2026we need to discuss tonight\u2019s party.\u201d\n\u201cTonight\u2019s what?\u201d\nOliver stiffened. \u201cDid His Highness not tell you?\u201d\n\u201cNo, he most certainly did not! There\u2019s to be a party?\u201d\n\u201cUgh, not again!\u201d Oliver dug his knuckles into his forehead.\nRishe put two and two together. She hesitated, then said, \u201cSo there is one, then. As you must know, His Highness is trying to stamp it down without telling me.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d Oliver replied. \u201cHe should have mentioned it to you. You don\u2019t need to attend, but he will. At least, I hope he will. I think I managed to convince him.\u201d\nShe sympathized with Oliver. Under normal circumstances, it would be unheard of for the crown prince and his fianc\u00e9e to fail to appear at a banquet. \u201cDon\u2019t worry, Oliver. I\u2019ll go.\u201d\nOliver let out a sigh of relief. \u201cReally? Thank you so much, my lady. I\u2019ll put finding you a maid at the top of my to-do list.\u201d\n\u201cNo need.\u201d Rishe smiled. \u201cI can prepare for the party on my own.\u201d\nThis maid-selection process made Rishe uneasy. After witnessing that exchange between the servants in the garden, she imagined quarrels breaking out all through the palace. And she doubted the disputes would go away even after they decided.\nOliver frowned. \u201cBut won\u2019t dressing be difficult without a lady\u2019s maid?\u201d \nShe shook her head. \u201cI can do my hair and put on a gown by myself. I brought dresses and cosmetics from home. Don\u2019t worry.\u201d\nRishe ignored Oliver\u2019s stunned look, already reevaluating her cleaning plans.\n \n***\n \nThe first thing Rishe said to Arnold that night was, \u201cYour Highness, I have a request.\u201d Her gown rustled as she leaned in close. \u201cI would like some herb seed and a corner of the gardens. I made a list. I hope we can discuss this in more detail later.\u201d\nArnold was silent a moment. \u201cRishe.\u201d\n\u201cWhat? Didn\u2019t you tell me to let you know if there was anything I wanted?\u201d She looked at him quizzically, and Arnold sighed.\nShe\u2019d heard that he\u2019d finished his mountain of work and even managed to sleep for a while. He was dressed in his usual military black, trimmed with a red mantle and black gloves.\nArnold shook his head. \u201cThat\u2019s not what I mean. I\u2019m guessing that Oliver didn\u2019t tell you the reason for this party? It\u2019s merely for appearance\u2019s sake. I need to look like I\u2019m searching for a bride within our borders as well. There\u2019s no reason for you to attend.\u201d\nIt made sense. The crown prince\u2014the greatest catch in the kingdom\u2014marrying a foreigner without even the slightest nod to propriety would invite unwanted discontent from the nobility.\n\u201cHowever, we\u2019re betrothed,\u201d Arnold said. \u201cThis whole evening is merely a formality. And with news that you\u2019re my \u2018hostage\u2019 going around, you\u2019ll be an object of curiosity. I don\u2019t want to put you through that.\u201d\n\u201cWell, I already went to the trouble of getting ready.\u201d Rishe plucked at her soft blue dress, draped in fluttering layers around her like a flower bud. She\u2019d braided her hair, decorating it with accessories. Her makeup was light, her shoes polished to a mirror shine. Her only jewelry was a pair of pearl earrings.\n\u201cRishe\u2026\u201d\n\u201cYour Highness, the court may consider my status as a captive princess shameful in the extreme, but I don\u2019t.\u201d She\u2019d chosen this course, after all.\nArnold was again watching her with a mixture of wonder and confusion.\n\u201cSo don\u2019t worry,\u201d she said, extending her hand. \u201cFeel free to show off your fianc\u00e9e.\u201d\nArnold relented, his dashing smile creeping out once again. \u201cVery well. I should take advantage of this opportunity to touch my betrothed.\u201d\n\u201cWe\u2019re wearing gloves.\u201d\nArnold took Rishe\u2019s hand.\nA throng of guests was gathered in the ballroom as a group of musicians performed on a platform. Women in gowns stood clustered, while gentlemen in military attire grouped together. A mere glance was enough to tell their clothes were of the highest quality. They mingled happily, making small talk with glasses in hand.\nRishe let her hand rest on Arnold\u2019s arm as she paused at the threshold to take it all in. \u201cThis is a bigger event than I was expecting.\u201d\n\u201cIs it? I\u2019d say it\u2019s a rather small gathering, actually.\u201d\n\u201cMaybe for a military powerhouse,\u201d Rishe muttered. \nYet another reminder of Galkhein\u2019s wealth took her off guard. Arnold just looked bored.\n\u201cThe size doesn\u2019t matter,\u201d he said. \u201cIn the end, they\u2019re only here for gossip. Look, here they come.\u201d\nIn the blink of an eye, they were surrounded by guests.\n\u201cPrince Arnold, thank you for gracing us with an invitation,\u201d said one man. \u201cSuch a pleasure.\u201d \n\u201cThe pleasure is mine, Lord Abel,\u201d Arnold drawled.\n\u201cYour Highness! We were so glad to hear of your safe return,\u201d another guest chirped. \u201cPlease, our daughter is simply dying to be regaled with tales of your trip.\u201d\n\u201cI can\u2019t imagine I\u2019d have anything particularly exciting to share with her,\u201d Arnold said curtly.\nAfter the last few days, Rishe found this look of glazed apathy disturbing. His good looks only compounded it\u2014he was so handsome that every expression was stark.\nHe looks more like Emperor Arnold Hein now, but still not the same.\nArnold appeared to notice her watching him. When he looked at her, his sourness disappeared, replaced by a genuine smile. All around him, women found themselves flushing. Arnold paid no heed to their fervent gazes, instead leaning in to give Rishe a brief moment of consideration.\nThen he leaned in close enough to kiss her.\n\u201cA dull trip,\u201d he said again, pulling away. \u201cBut fortuitous. Without it, I would have never met the woman destined to be my wife.\u201d\nA shocked murmur rolled through the crowd. Rishe, who hadn\u2019t recovered from seeing Arnold\u2019s beautiful face at close range, barely noticed the looks of utter loathing the assembled women were throwing her.\n\u201cH-His Highness is smiling? At his hostage bride?\u201d\n\u201cHe called her his wife?! He\u2019s never even looked at us!\u201d\nThey were whispers, but they carried.\nA portly man stepped forward with his daughter in tow. \u201cYour Highness, do you mean to say that this lovely young woman is your fianc\u00e9e?\u201d\nEvery eye in the ballroom was on Rishe, alight with curiosity, envy, or schemes. None of them could hide their contempt. But Rishe didn\u2019t falter.\nThis is nothing compared to being publicly dumped in a banquet hall. And I\u2019ve done that seven times!\nShe offered a polite smile and an astoundingly correct curtsy. Left leg at a diagonal behind the right, back straight, head bowed. \u201cHow do you do? My name is Rishe Irmgard Weitzner.\u201d\nEven the most hostile guests could find nothing impolite in her greeting, no sign of rough manners from the rustic daughter of a backwater nation. Rishe had years of training in expectation of ascending to the throne. Occasionally, habits from her other lives slipped through, but Arnold appeared to be the only one who noticed.\nNow he was looking at her with satisfaction. \u201cLady Rishe has only just arrived, and her acquaintances are few and far between. I hope I can count on you all to hold me accountable should I prove an incompetent husband.\u201d\n\u201cB-but of course, Your Highness.\u201d\n\u201cCome, Rishe.\u201d Arnold guided her out of the ring of spectators. The stares continued to follow them as they walked away.\nRishe dropped her voice to a whisper. \u201cYou sure know how to invite the ire of women.\u201d\n\u201cWhatever do you mean?\u201d\n\u201cThe way you harped on about me. Everything you said was tailor-made to stoke their jealousy. You\u2019ve gained me enemies, so thanks for that.\u201d\nArnold snorted. \u201cEverything I said was to protect you from enemies. They need to know you aren\u2019t just some trophy they can eliminate without recourse. We need to show them this to forestall any potential moves against you in the future.\n\u201cShow them what, exactly?\u201d\n\u201cThat I\u2019ll protect you no matter what.\u201d\nHe said it with such nonchalance that it brought her up short. Protect me? Arnold Hein, protect me?\nSuch an ironic position to take. She couldn\u2019t tell him that, of course. Her response came out somewhat strangled. \u201cI doubt they\u2019ll be anything to worry about. In fact, the biggest threat facing me is you.\u201d\n\u201cOh? And why do you say that?\u201d\n\u201cFor many reasons, the most obvious being that I\u2019m no match for you with a blade.\u201d As much as it pained her to admit it.\nArnold looked pleased. \u201cPerhaps we should duel.\u201d\n\u201cYes,",

She\u2019d never be a match in speed or raw power, but any insight would be invaluable.\n\u201cSure.\u201d Arnold shrugged. \u201cI don\u2019t mind.\u201d\n\u201cTruly?\u201d Her eyes glittered with anticipation.\nHe chuckled. \u201cYour answers never disappoint me.\u201d\n\u201cWhat\u2019s that supposed to mean? Oh, it looks like they\u2019re playing a new song.\u201d\nA soft melody drifted across the hall. The crowd divided, heading toward the center of"

Rishe found that sort of thing inelegant in the extreme, and she was embarrassed.\nArnold sighed at Rishe\u2019s apologetic bow. \u201cThere\u2019s nothing wrong with a wife invoking her husband\u2019s name.\u201d\nRishe hesitated. \u201cWe\u2019re not married yet.\u201d\n\u201cThat\u2019s a formality. It\u2019s as good as done, if you ask me.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2026see.\u201d\nHe took her distraction as an opportunity to swipe her glass back. Instead of dumping it out, Arnold gulped the rest of it down. \n\u201cDamn, that packs a punch,\u201d he grumbled.\n\u201cI told you that!\u201d Rishe snapped. \u201cAre you all right? Let me get you some water!\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m fine. But now you\u2019ve fulfilled your obligation to the wine, haven\u2019t you?\u201d\nRishe didn\u2019t know what to say. He\u2019d helped her\u2014not by taking charge but by following her lead. Without cutting her down and telling her she was being foolish. Without rolling his eyes and dismissing her desires as trifles.\n\u201cThank you,\u201d Rishe said stiffly, which just made him laugh.\n\u201cWhat were you thinking about when we were dancing?\u201d he asked.\n\u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d\n\u201cYou were thinking about someone else, weren\u2019t you? Who?\u201d\nRishe didn\u2019t know a delicate way to say I was thinking about a future version of you I met in another life.\n\u201cHmm?\u201d His tone was oddly light, teasing even. But the gleam in his hunter\u2019s eyes said she wouldn\u2019t get away so easily.\nObviously, Rishe couldn\u2019t give him an honest answer. \u201cI wasn\u2019t thinking about anyone else. I was worried about you.\u201d\n\u201cWhy?\u201d\nThis was the closest she could come to the truth. \u201cWere you injured here?\u201d She patted her own left shoulder with her forefinger. \nArnold went silent. His left shoulder was slightly slower to react than his right\u2014if his right was at one hundred, then his left was at maybe ninety-eight. It was hardly noticeable, but Rishe had picked up on it. He was right-handed, and she wouldn\u2019t have noticed it if they\u2019d been dancing normally. \nThat, and if it hadn\u2019t been for memories from her past life.\nRishe had only managed to inflict a single injury on him. An instant, a moment\u2019s hesitation where she saw her chance and slashed left. Of course, he\u2019d shrugged off the injury and effortlessly run her through. \n\u201cHeh.\u201d Arnold finally broke his silence with grim laughter. His eyes sent shivers down her spine, cold and bewitching. In lieu of an answer, he reached for his collar, unfastening the clasp with a snap and drawing his jacket open with a rough tug.\nOh my.\nRishe drew in a breath. A great scar was engraved into the nape of his neck, just low enough to be concealed by clothing. It looked several years old. \u201cIt\u2019s an old wound. It continues to the top of my shoulder and pulls the skin taut.\u201d\n\u201cHow awful.\u201d Rishe couldn\u2019t help but reach out to gingerly touch the nape of his neck.\nArnold accepted her touch without a word. She\u2019d half expected to be slapped aside.\nHer fingers slowly traced the shape of it. She could feel the rough skin through her gloves.\nHe must have gotten this over a decade ago. Someone stabbed him\u2014and not just once or twice. They must have done it over and over to make this scar pattern.\nHer medical training had her shuddering at the image of a nine-year-old Arnold ashen and trembling with blood loss. The fact that he\u2019d survived and retained the use of his arm was incredible. And then to go on to wield a sword so skillfully\u2014his suffering must have been immense.\n\u201cOnly a few people know about this injury. You\u2019re the first to notice on your own.\u201d\n\u201cHow did it happen?\u201d\nThat grim smile returned as he looked down at Rishe. With the moon hanging behind him, he was as opaque as ever, but Rishe understood the sentiment.\nI shouldn\u2019t pry.\nRishe pulled her hand away, and that ominous smile that sent chills down her spine disappeared. Arnold put his jacket back in order, reclasping it at the neck.\nSomeone tried to kill Arnold Hein about ten years ago. But who and why? Rishe cast her eyes down as she ruminated. The most obvious beneficiaries of a dead crown prince would be potential heirs and those loyal to them. I believe Arnold has a younger brother, but I haven\u2019t met him yet.\nOdd. Rishe might be a hostage, but shouldn\u2019t she meet her future relatives? Perhaps it was Arnold\u2019s doing and not the will of the imperial family themselves. He didn\u2019t seem to want to involve her in anything unless it was absolutely necessary\u2014he hadn\u2019t told her about this ball, after all. \nRishe looked up at him. \u201cYour Highness, may I select my maids some time over the next few days?\u201d \n\u201cVery well. I\u2019ll tell Oliver to make that a priority.\u201d\n\u201cAh, I can do the selection myself. We needn\u2019t trouble him.\u201d\nArnold arched an amused brow. Gone was that unsettling smile, replaced with his easy manner. \u201cWhat are you planning this time?\u201d\n\u201cOh, nothing important,\u201d Rishe said. She picked up her empty glass. \u201cI\u2019m merely concerned about the servants\u2019 working conditions.\u201d\nTo protect her life and well-being, she needed to keep from dying at twenty years old again. And to do that, she had to prevent Arnold Hein\u2019s war. Her best bet would be to appeal to the important people she\u2019d known in her past lives. People with influence.\nPlus, there was a mountain of things she needed to do in preparation for the marriage ceremony.\nI need to sow a plot of land, grow herbs, do lots of shopping, get cheap alcohol, and then\u2026 \nRishe began a to-do list that had nothing to do with war in the least.\n \n***\n \nAs the ball wound to a close, a lone boy stood in the gloomy courtyard of the imperial palace. He had soft black hair and round blue eyes. No older than sixteen, he had an androgynous grace to him, gaze fixed on the balcony above. \nHe was watching a girl.\nShe had coral-colored hair, and even from this distance, he could tell she was beautiful. She stood there alone, apparently waiting for someone. Whoever it was must have shown up because her hand slipped from the banister, and she stepped away. Not too long after, a man appeared where she had been standing.\nThe man turned a silent glare down into the garden, as if he\u2019d known the boy had been there the whole time, despite the shadows.\nA shiver ran down the boy\u2019s spine and he smiled reflexively, delighting in the intense aura of threat the man gave off. It was just a warning, it seemed, as the man abruptly turned on his heel and disappeared. \n\u201cAww, we can\u2019t play together either?\u201d The boy hung his head. \u201cI miss you, Brother.\u201d\nIt had to be the woman. The beauty. She\u2019d made the boy\u2019s life hell since the day she arrived. \nHis brother had prohibited him from attending balls like this one. That was fine; he\u2019d sooner avoid them altogether. Still, he\u2019d wanted to meet that girl. \n\u201cBut we\u2019ll meet soon enough, won\u2019t we?\u201d He spoke to himself in a soft voice. \u201cI\u2019ve got plans for you, Sister.\u201d \n\n(2) chapter number given is likely out of range: 0\nChapter: 8\n\nChapter 3\nChapter 3\n \n\u201cYOU\u2019RE ALL SO USELESS!\u201d Diana the redheaded maid\u2019s voice rang out inside the stone washhouse. \nThree days had passed since the afternoon Rishe shook off her guard and came out to the well. Rishe was once again dressed to fit in with the maids. At Diana\u2019s shout, she looked up without pausing in her work. \n\u201cIs even laundry beyond your capabilities? I asked you to wash these this morning, and now it\u2019s past noon! Meanwhile, we\u2019ve finished cleaning the entire first floor in a third of the time!\u201d\n\u201cI-I\u2019m sorry, Diana.\u201d\nThe new maids went silent with shame. Among them was Elsie, the girl Rishe stood up for the other day. Rishe pulled her hands out of the soapy water, gently rinsed them, and said, \u201cLet me help. What still needs to be done?\u201d\n\u201cYou again?\u201d Diana rounded on Rishe. \u201cI don\u2019t know who you serve, but I\u2019m amazed you have the time to do other people\u2019s work. I wish I had so much free time.\u201d\nHuffily, she turned from Rishe. \u201cLet\u2019s just ignore these useless fools. Laura, Maya. Come on. If we want to be chosen as Lady Rishe\u2019s maids, we mustn\u2019t waste our time.\u201d\nDiana took out a slip of paper from her pocket, smoothing it out. \u201cIt looks like the new bedsheets for her palace will arrive today. We should inspect them to make sure everything is perfect!\u201d\n\u201cWait up, Diana!\u201d\nThe two maids followed Diana out. Rishe waited for the door to close before turning to Elsie and the others. \u201cLet\u2019s keep working. If there\u2019s anything too large and cumbersome, feel free to pass it over to me.\u201d\n\u201cTh-thank you so much!\u201d The new maids went weak with gratitude. One of them, a girl on the verge of tears, even fell into a full bow. Rishe muttered encouragement as she scrubbed some bedsheets.\nElsie, who was washing the sheets with her, wore a rueful look. \u201cI\u2019m so sorry for the trouble. We\u2019re just not learning fast enough.\u201d\n\u201cYou haven\u2019t been working here long, have you? It takes time to learn a new job, no matter who you are,\u201d Rishe said as she kept scrubbing. \u201cAnd it\u2019s not like you\u2019ve never washed a single thing in your life before, right?\u201d\nElsie nodded nervously. \nRishe had realized over the past few days doing the laundry that not all the newcomers were complete amateurs. They\u2019d obviously done chores at home, or something similar. When set a specific task, they could perform it properly, but Diana\u2019s complaints weren\u2019t unfounded. They did take far too much time with laundry.\nBut it\u2019s obvious why. \u201cDo you know anything about Diana?\u201d Rishe asked Elsie. \u201cLike, is she from a well-off family?\u201d\nElsie said, \u201cI heard that her father was a business owner. She worked with him.\u201d\n\u201cI heard that as well,\u201d added another maid. \u201cBut he fell into debt and had to sell off.\u201d \nRishe stopped scrubbing for a moment to consider this.\n\u201cUm, is something the matter?\u201d Elsie asked.\nRishe smiled and shook her head. \u201cNo, nothing. Let\u2019s just focus on getting these washed for the time being.\u201d\n \n***\n \nThat afternoon, thirty maids were assembled in the detached wing of the palace. Ten of them were old hands, long in service to the royal family, while the other twenty were freshly hired. The crown princess was to choose her maids from among these thirty. They wore their nerves plainly on their sleeves. \n\u201cHey, I thought this palace was in a terrible state of neglect,\u201d one maid whispered. \u201cWhy is it so sparkling clean?\u201d\n\u201cYeah, you\u2019re right,\u201d said another. \u201cSomeone must have sorted it out before we arrived.\u201d\n\u201cI wonder what kind of person Lady Rishe is. Ooh, I\u2019m so nervous.\u201d\nThe girls looked around anxiously.\n\u201cHey, Elsie, that girl who was always helping us isn\u2019t here.\u201d\nElsie blinked. \u201cYou\u2019re right.\u201d\n\u201cLook, Diana. That impertinent newbie didn\u2019t get picked.\u201d \nAt her friend\u2019s observation, Diana preened with satisfaction. \u201cNo surprise there. You need some manners to attend to Lady Rishe. I bet she got kicked out of the running!\u201d Her eyes sparkled with confidence.\nAt last, there was a knock at the door.\n\u201cHer Royal Highness, Princess Rishe.\u201d\nThe maids quickly fell into bows. Diana\u2019s chest ached with anticipation as heels clicked on the floor, approaching the line of girls. From the corner of their eyes, the maids saw a wide-skirted court dress. A gentle scent washed over them.\nWithout even looking at her, they could tell Crown Princess Rishe was a lovely woman. Diana and her friends swelled with pride that she was to become their mistress.\nBut then Laura whispered to Diana, \u201cHey, isn\u2019t this scent familiar?\u201d\n\u201cQuiet!\u201d Clearly it was some sort of expensive perfume. Or so Diana thought, but then she realized what it was. The words just slipped out. \u201cIt\u2019s soap.\u201d\n\u201cHuh? Did you just say something?\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s soap. The same kind we always use.\u201d Diana was sure of it.\nThe princess said, \u201cPlease rise.\u201d \nWhy did her voice sound so familiar? An incredible foreboding gripping her, Diana looked up. She gasped.\n\u201cMy name is Rishe Irmgard Weitzner.\u201d\nBefore her stood the beautiful newcomer\u2014the thorn in her side for the past few days. The smile she wore was peaceful and just the slightest bit satisfied.\n \n***\n \nI\u2019m so glad I managed to finish washing the sheets in time!\nStanding before the maids with Arnold\u2019s attendant Oliver at her side, Rishe was panicking on the inside. She\u2019d had so much to do this morning that she\u2019d put off the laundry to the last minute. She took deep, controlled breaths, praying no one would notice that she\u2019d raced here at a dead sprint.\nOliver was none the wiser as he spoke to the assembled girls. Rishe took the opportunity to look them over. She locked eyes with Elsie, who was gaping at her. It was a nice change\u2014usually her face was as blank as a rock wall.\nI\u2019m sorry for the deception. I figured blending in would give me the best picture of your working conditions.\nThe new maids wore similarly shocked expressions, while others watched her with delight. Meanwhile, the veterans, including Diana, had all gone pale. They trembled, stunned into silence. One seemed locked in a terrifying trance, while another looked on the verge of tears. All of them had spoken to Rishe with derision. As the ringleader, Diana was covering her mouth with both hands, like she was holding in a scream.\nOliver had finished his introduction. \u201cYour Highness, if you would?\u201d\nRishe stepped forward. \u201cFirst, I must apologize to you for what has transpired prior to this meeting. My deception, that is. However, it has granted me insight into how each one of you works.\u201d\nOliver\u2019s face creased in confusion. The newcomer maids began to panic, whispering among themselves.\n\u201cDoesn\u2019t this mean that she helped us out with the laundry?\u201d\n\u201cWe\u2019re going to be fired!\u201d\n\u201cIf I lose my position, my brother will have to quit school!\u201d\nNoticing the commotion, Oliver glanced at Rishe. \u201cYour Highness, two-thirds of these maids are newly recruited from the city. Since the majority of the castle maids were elderly, His Highness assumed you would prefer maids closer in age to yourself.\u201d\nRishe was startled. She had found it odd that most of her potential servants were new hires, but she hadn\u2019t expected this to be the reason.\n\u201cWhile the prince has entrusted the selection of your maids to you,\u201d Oliver went on. \u201cHiring someone with no experience will not do. Despite Prince Arnold\u2019s views, I urge you to reject the newcomers.\u201d\n\u201cOliver.\u201d\n\u201cI have a list of their names here. Elsie\u2014\u201d\n\u201cElsie, Nichole, Hilde, Marguerite, Rosa.\u201d Rishe began listing the names of the newly recruited maids. She\u2019d made a point to memorize them in the washhouse. \u201cElke, Amelia, and\u2014\u201d\nOliver looked at her wildly. \u201cYou know them all?! Even though they\u2019ve never served you in the past?\u201d\n\u201cYes, of course I do. Servants are essential to the maintenance of our lifestyle,",
    "query_text": " why wouldn\u2019t I get to know them?\u201d Rishe listed the remaining names for good measure. \u201cAll twenty of you, listen to me.\u201d \nThe new maids stiffened. Diana and the other maids whose names hadn\u2019t been called were getting their wind back, wearing increasingly triumphant looks.\nRishe said, \u201cThe twenty names I just called will be my maids.\u201d\nTime seemed to stand still a moment, and then Oliver broke in with an astonished, \u201cB-but, my lady! They are all inexperienced\u2014\u201d\n\u201cYes. And my palace will be the perfect place to learn.\u201d\nThe new recruits were completely speechless, unsure of exactly what was happening. \nRishe smiled at Elsie. \u201cI hope you\u2019ll serve me well, Elsie.\u201d\nElsie was still frozen in place. \u201cHuh? Y-yes, my lady, but\u2014\u201d\n"

If time\u2019s just going to keep resetting, I wish I could start at an earlier point. I need more time to prepare!\n\u201cWait! Rishe!\u201d\nThe crown prince was on the verge of tears, and the spectators struggled to suppress their snickers. \nA thought occurred to Rishe, and she stopped. She then turned, her eyes gleaming beneath long lashes as she stared down her ex-fianc\u00e9. \u201cAh, Your Highness, I almost forgot.\u201d \n\u201cYes, tell me!\u201d the prince fumed. \u201cLet me guess, you are hurt beyond measure and yet love me still\u2026correct?\u201d\nAs if. Rishe was grateful to be granted her freedom. In fact, she was smiling as she said, \u201cI hope you and Lady Mary are happy together.\u201d\n\u201cWhat?!\u201d\n\u201cMay we both lead fulfilling lives. Farewell!\u201d Rishe lifted the skirts of her evening gown and turned on her heel, departing as briskly as she could.\n\u201cHow do you know about Mary? I haven\u2019t told you I love her!\u201d The prince was shouting something behind her, but she paid him no mind. She had things to do.\nDuring her first loop, the prince\u2019s accusations had shocked her to the core and she\u2014foolishly so\u2014had attempted to defend herself. Now she knew better than to expect the prince to behave reasonably. \nHow will life unfold this time? I\u2019m excited to find out! Rishe fixed her mind on the future.\nThis is my seventh \u201cdo-over.\u201d I\u2019ve led happy and carefree lives before, but this time\u2014this time, I swear I\u2019ll live a long happy and carefree life!\nIn other words, she needed to avoid getting killed. At any cost. \n \n***\n \nIn the first loop, with her engagement broken and her reputation in tatters, Rishe roamed with nothing but the clothes on jewelry. Finding them a good-natured band, she hitched a ride to a neighboring country.\nFrom the merchant caravan, she learned a trade, studying how to procure stock and balance ledgers. Eventually, she set out on her own to travel the world. Her upbringing as a daughter of the nobility meant that, even at fifteen years old, Rishe possessed a keen sense for beauty.\nShe collected things that caught her eye and sold them to whoever found delight in her wares. Before she realized it, she had become a major vendor, employing a full staff. She had even done business with the king of a desert nation and the prince of a frozen country up north. She traveled to many distant places, realizing a dream born from her cossetted former life spent doing nothing but preparing to be queen.\nFive years passed, and just as she had only one country left to visit, Rishe fell victim to the war sweeping across the continent.\nThe next thing she knew, she was fifteen years old again and back at that party, with the prince poised to make his pronouncement.\n\u201cRishe Irmgard Weitzner! You are a vile woman! A truly malicious creature unworthy of the crown prince! As of this instant, our engagement is off!\u201d\nNaturally, she didn\u2019t understand what was going on at first. She looked around. Everything was the same. She stood in the same place wearing the same dress and draped in the same jewelry she\u2019d sold to the caravan.\nWas it a dream? Or was everything that had happened up until then the dream? In her confusion, all she could do was stare.\nRishe hurried out of the ballroom, the impending threat of exile hanging over her and the prince\u2019s entreaties to halt ringing in her ears.\nThis is perfect! Now I can get it right! I\u2019ll grab everything valuable from my room.\nRishe had enjoyed her life as a merchant, but she had always felt a stirring of regret about this night. If only she\u2019d brought some funds from home, she would\u2019ve had the capital to establish her business much sooner!\nSpeaking of this regret always prompted disbelief from her customers, including the king of the desert. \u201cWhat? That\u2019s what you\u2019d want to do over?!\u201d\nWhen she arrived back at home on the night of her second life, Rishe grabbed her jewelry box and as many of the books her late grandmother had left her as she could carry, then made haste to the forest to meet the caravan. But the stop at her house took time, and she missed them completely.\nIn that moment, Rishe made a stark realization. Different choices meant different mistakes. Opening one door would close another.\nAnd so the easy path to a life in commerce was closed to her.\nSure, she could try to build her business from the ground up, but personal connections were almost as essential to being a merchant as business savvy. It just wasn\u2019t realistic without a single acquaintance. \nSorting through her belongings in resignation, she came across a foreign encyclopedia of herbs among her grandmother\u2019s books. Taking it as a sign, Rishe sold her jewels elsewhere and used the funds to cross the sea and pursue the study of medicine.\nFortunately, Rishe retained all her knowledge from her previous life. She remembered that certain expensive herbs could be acquired cheaply in other regions. When word spread of a disease running rampant in a neighboring country, she recalled that too. This foreknowledge proved invaluable, as did her wide travel and exposure to many different teachers with many different points of view.\nAs such, Rishe led a successful life as an apothecary. She saved a feeble prince, synthesized a number of rare medicines with her mercantile knowledge, and thus spent her days in the simple joy of helping those in need.\nUnfortunately, all the joy in the world couldn\u2019t stand up to an epidemic. Thus ended her second life. \nOnce again, she found herself in the moment of her broken engagement, the curtain rising on the third loop. Her next four lives proceeded much the same way. As a skilled lady\u2019s maid, she helped a young noblewoman to a fortuitous marriage. Once, she even disguised herself as a man and became a knight. Every life was worth living, and she enjoyed them all. She enjoyed living, period.\nThere was just one problem.\nNo matter what I do, I die at twenty.\nShe enjoyed her lives, but she was not permitted to do so for long. With this time limit always hanging over her, she spent each loop in a state of constant activity.\nI would love to take it easy for a while. Is a little leisure time too much to ask? Obviously I don\u2019t want to die either! This time, I\u2019ll make as much money as I can in the first five years. Then, when I turn twenty, I\u2019ll live a life free of worldly cares. I\u2019ll do whatever\u2019s necessary to stay alive!\nHer mind made up, Rishe began her seventh life in a dead sprint through the palace. Regardless of her future plans, she was in a race against time. She needed to beat the messenger bearing news of her scandal.\nAs she ran, she yanked off her hair ornaments; she planned to sell them and didn\u2019t want to risk losing one. Her hair billowed out behind her, falling in loose waves.\nSuddenly, an idea occurred to her, one she hadn\u2019t had in any of her previous six lives.\nLeaving through the palace gardens would be faster. I can climb down a tree from the balcony.\nRishe had gone to war as a knight in the life just before this one. After the punishing battlefield training, climbing trees was nothing.\nSeamlessly, she changed direction. She raced for the balcony, where she ran into something at full speed.\n\u201cBwargh!\u201d Rishe let out a very unladylike grunt, staggering a few steps. She looked up to see what she\u2019d bounced off of. \u201cOh\u2026\u201d\nAn exceptionally handsome man stood in her path.\nHe had refined, patrician features and cruel, thin lips.",
    "query_text": " He was slender yet powerful; even through his clothes, Rishe could tell his body was well conditioned. His jet-black hair covered his ears, creeping down to the nape of his neck. The tips of his locks bounced with his movements. They looked to be soft to the touch.\nFrom head to toe, he was a pleasure to look at\u2014but what held Rishe\u2019s attention were his eyes. They were long in shape and impossibly blue, but they possessed a blade-sharp intensity. His gaze was"

He would plan a mad coup d\u2019\u00e9tat against the king, attempting to provoke the citizens to war. His plan would be discovered in its early stages, rendering him a laughingstock across the kingdom.\n\u201cYou must shape your future with your own hands\u2014you mustn\u2019t entrust your desires to others.\u201d \n\u201cMy\u2026my desires?\nRishe nodded.\nMary was looking at her like she was speaking a foreign language. \u201cBut I\u2019m their elder sister.\u201d Her voice quivered. \u201cI must endure, no matter what. Otherwise, my brothers will never be happy.\u201d\n\u201cAnd you believe their happiness can only be achieved by sacrificing your own?\u201d\nMary gasped as she gaped at Rishe.\n\u201cYou don\u2019t need to throw away your own future to protect those you love,\u201d Rishe told her. \u201cNo matter what path you choose, never forget that.\u201d\n\u201cMy future?\u201d Mary\u2019s voice went ragged, like she was barely suppressing a wail of pain.\n\u201cI wish you a life where both you and your family can be happy,\u201d said Rishe.\nMary stood frozen in place, eyes gleaming like precious stones. Rishe couldn\u2019t help but admire how pretty she was. She truly did wish her happiness. But right now, she needed to take care of herself. \n\u201cWell.\u201d Rishe suddenly broke into a smile, making Dietrich flinch. \u201cI think it\u2019s time for me to be on my way.\u201d\nShe regretted losing access to her room, but she knew her parents wouldn\u2019t let her in. Turning her back on the crowd, Rishe contemplated her next move.\n\u201cWait, Lady Rishe!\u201d Mary\u2019s voice rang out.\n\u201cThat\u2019s right. You\u2019re not going anywhere, Rishe!\u201d The prince joined her. \u201cYou won\u2019t get away with treating me like trash to relieve your own injured heart.\u201d\n\u201cUgh, enough already!\u201d Rishe\u2019s patience was fraying. \u201cI don\u2019t have anything else to say to you. Goodbye!\u201d\n\u201cKnights, stop her!\u201d\nReluctantly, the knights moved to tail Rishe as she walked briskly back down the path. She sympathized with them, but she wasn\u2019t about to let them keep her here. Rounding a corner, she sensed something uncanny. She stopped, the knights quickly catching up with her.\n\u201cMy apologies, Lady Rishe. If you could please remain for just a\u2014whoa!\u201d\nRishe grabbed the hilt of the knight\u2019s sword. Yanking it from his belt, she spun around and stood at the ready. Metal rang against metal as Rishe parried a blow. She glared at her would-be attacker as he stepped out of the shadows.\nArnold Hein!\n\u201cWell, what do you know.\u201d The man smiling so sweetly while their swords locked was the very man who had ended her life. \u201cYou do have some skill.\u201d\nMetal screeched and slid, before Arnold sheathed his sword. Rishe lowered hers. Neither looked away.\n\u201cWho the hell are you?\u201d demanded one of the knights.\n\u201cStand down, good sirs,\u201d Rishe said. \u201cYour interference will only make this worse.\u201d\nThis mostly served to befuddle the knights further. Rishe absolutely couldn\u2019t allow them to come to blows with the crown prince of a friendly nation. And they couldn\u2019t beat him\u2014not even if they took him all at once. Rishe had blocked his blow, but her arm was completely numb. To think he\u2019d be even more powerful in five years.\nHe regarded her unabashedly. \u201cRishe, was that your name? Where did you learn such swordsmanship?\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m afraid I cannot say. Besides, you were clearly going easy on me.\u201d\n\u201cHa! You could tell?\u201d\nArnold\u2019s manner was throwing her off. He seemed to be enjoying himself. He\u2019s laughing. This monstrous prince is\u2026actually laughing.\nWhen she had met him in her other life, he was cold and merciless, like a genuine monster. And yet here he stood, mellow and smiling.\nThe Emperor Arnold Hein I knew was twenty-four years old, so he\u2019s, what? Nineteen now? This is so weird. He\u2019s grinning like a boy getting into a scrape.\nThat attack had been good-natured as well, almost playful. It had muscle behind it but certainly not any lethal intent. He\u2019d just wanted to force Rishe to catch the blow. She found it unbelievable that he could exude such an overpowering air of menace when he was just messing around.\nWhile Rishe was focused on Arnold, Mary and Dietrich caught up, seemingly recovered.\n\u201cExcuse me, my lord!\u201d Mary squeaked. \u201cI-I-I don\u2019t know who you are, but kindly step away from Lady Rishe!\u201d\n\u201cYes, do as she says! Who the hell are you, anyway?!\u201d\nDon\u2019t tell me Prince Dietrich doesn\u2019t recognize one of his personal guests.\nDietrich\u2019s interests did not lean toward diplomacy; he likely hadn\u2019t bothered to introduce himself to Arnold. Mary, for her part, seemed to grasp that Arnold wasn\u2019t ordinary. She stood up to defend Rishe, despite the tremble in her voice. In a better world, perhaps the two of them could have become friends.\n\u201cThat\u2019s your ex-fianc\u00e9?\u201d Arnold cocked a brow. \u201cHe\u2019s even worse than I imagined. Pathetic.\u201d\nDietrich flushed. \u201cI\u2019ll have your head!\u201d\n\u201cDietrich, I beg of you, contain yourself,\u201d Rishe said, then rounded on Arnold. \u201cAs for you, Your Highness\u2014you know who Dietrich is, and you know what speaking carelessly could mean. Are you trying to pick a fight?\u201d\n\u201cWhatever do you mean?\u201d Arnold\u2019s brows lifted high, making him the picture of innocence. \u201cBelieve me, Lady Rishe, every word I speak is chosen with extreme care.\u201d\nFinally realizing who Arnold was, Dietrich visibly paled. \u201cArnold? He\u2019s the crown prince of Galkhein?\u201d\nMary yelped. The knights stood down, shamefaced. The gossip-hungry neighbors who\u2019d gathered to witness a scandal play out drew back in fear.\n\u201cHe\u2019s the demon prince? The one who single-handedly destroyed a whole order of enemy knights?\u201d\n\u201cWatch your tongue, fool! Do you want him to do the same to you?\u201d\nThe two nations enjoyed peaceful relations, but Arnold remained the dreaded prince, heir to the throne of a former enemy. Current rumor wasn\u2019t as widespread as it would be in five years, but he was still regarded with distrust.\nThe onlookers stood rooted to the spot, too terrified to flee.\nWell, this has devolved into a full-fledged disaster.\nRishe heaved a frustrated sigh. \u201cPrince Arnold, to what do we owe this honor? Surely a crown prince would not draw his sword for a mere jest.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m here on business,\u201d Arnold said. \u201cBut first, I must beg forgiveness for my rudeness.\u201d\nHuh, what do you know? Once he became emperor, he\u2019d gladly behead any subject who so much as dared speak a word against him.\nI guess at nineteen he still knew how to apologize.\nIf that surprised her, Arnold\u2019s next act completely obliterated her sense of reality. \nWith a flourish, he fell to his knees. \n\u201cHuh?\u201d Is this actually happening? \nHe was a man destined for an imperial crown. A man who would stand at the head of a military powerhouse and spread his rule across continents.\nArnold, known for his frigid pride, knelt to the disgraced daughter of a duke.\nAnd not only that\u2014his head was bowed, looking nothing so much as a knight swearing allegiance to his lady. If it were anyone else, it would be a delightful, pious image. Instead, the assembled looked on in terrified awe.\nNot Rishe, though.\n\u201cWhat are you doing?\u201d she hissed. \u201cGet up!\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m apologizing for my baseless impertinence. Also, I\u2019m asking you\u2026\u201d He trailed off to take Rishe\u2019s hand, tugging her forward so forcefully she staggered. He gazed up at her.\nUgh. He\u2019s so beautiful. No matter how many times she looked at him, it didn\u2019t become any less disarming. Long eyelashes, arched brows, a noble nose. His bright blue eyes reminded her of the drift ice she\u2019d seen in a northern kingdom, gazing out from a ship in one of her past lives. She knew she was dwelling on this to buy time, even as the reality before her sank in.\n\u201c\u2026to become my wife.\u201d\nShe froze, unable to process the words. \u201cWhat?\u201d Rishe glanced around, desperately searching the faces of the crowd. They all seemed as stunned as she felt. She looked down at Arnold again. \u201cYour wife?\u201d \n\u201cYes, that\u2019s right.\u201d\n\u201cYou want me to become your wife?\u201d\n\u201cYes.\u201d\nRishe couldn\u2019t speak. This was truly happening. It was real. It clicked into place in her head, and she let out a strangled grunt.\nWhat is going on? Why is this happening?\nShock lapped at her, fuzzing at the corners of her vision. He wanted to marry her. Arnold wanted to marry Rishe. Her murderer wanted to marry her.\nWhy is he doing this? He must have some ulterior motive, a broader goal. But I have to give him an answer.\nThe onlookers were holding their breath as Rishe said flatly, \u201cI reject your proposal.\u201d\nArnold said nothing.\nShe had to reject him. She was going to live a long, peaceful, carefree life, damn it, and no one would stop her. And yet\u2026\nArnold began to laugh, and the deep, creeping sense of dread inside Rishe only grew. Why does he seem so amused by this?!\n \n***\n \nHer previous life was her sixth. Disguised as a man, Rishe rose as a warrior of an island country she came upon in her travels. It was a conventional yet charming kingdom formed of red brick. After striking up a friendship with a group of knights who didn\u2019t realize she was a woman, Rishe followed their advice and joined them.\nThe training was grueling enough to make her wish she were dead. Back when she had lived as a noble, she\u2019d learned how to wield a sword for basic self-defense, but training as a noble lady had in no way prepared her for this. She drilled relentlessly, barely taking the time to sleep. Just as she became a full-fledged knight, Emperor Arnold\u2019s forces lay siege to the castle.\n \n***\n \nHow could this happen? \nIn her seventh life, Rishe wearily sank into her chair. Across from her sat Arnold, his legs crossed and chin propped up on his hand, watching her lazily.\n\u201cWhat\u2019s the matter?\u201d he asked. \u201cYou seem unhappy.\u201d\n\u201cYou could say that.\u201d Even her voice was grumpy. Still, she couldn\u2019t very well tell him it was because she bore a grudge from a previous life. After the first time her life rewound to that pivotal moment, she\u2019d resolved to keep her loops a secret. \u201cI had plans for my exile. A brand-new life. And now because of you, my parents are involved. Even the king has heard about it!\u201d\nAfter Rishe rejected Arnold, Dietrich had immediately cried out, \u201cTh-the crown prince of Galkhein proposed to Rishe?!\u201d\nHis shrieks were loud enough to attract the attention of the master and mistress of the manor.\nWhen her parents came out, Rishe had protested, \u201cI\u2019m not going to marry him! I\u2019m leaving the country just as Dietrich commanded.\u201d\nNo one listened. Their faces just paled with nervous confusion.\nJust then, a glittering coach arrived. Half-stuck in the mud, the man inside it was forced to trudge over the swampy ground, and so the king of Hermity himself arrived, staggering and dirt-stained. \nHe grabbed hold of his son\u2019s collar, pushing him into a low bow. He then turned to Prince Arnold and said, rather loudly, \u201cYour Highness! Allow me to apologize for my son\u2019s foolishness! You are an esteemed guest all the way from Galkhein! It is unthinkable he would not offer you the courtesy you are due!\u201d\n\u201cYou\u2019re hurting me, Father! My back!\u201d\nThe king then turned to Rishe. \u201cMy lady, allow me to sincerely apologize as both a king and a father. My son\u2019s behavior toward you has been utterly disgraceful. I beg you to please give Prince Arnold\u2019s proposal due consideration. Not only for your own sake but for the sake of your country.\u201d\nThe king bowed to her as deeply as his son had to Arnold, and her parents joined him. Rishe felt dizzy at the sight of this abject debasement in the presence of citizens.\nArnold, who had been watching the proceedings with a detached amusement, sobered and stepped toward the king. \u201cYour Majesty, please rise.\u201d\nWithout the smirk, Arnold\u2019s face immediately reverted to its cold mask. The king didn\u2019t move. Maybe something in Arnold\u2019s voice kept him frozen.\n\u201cSuch a trifle won\u2019t cause discord between our kingdoms,\u201d he went on. \u201cHowever, I would beg a little time to speak with Lady Rishe.\u201d\nLater, Rishe would learn that Arnold\u2019s attendant had spoken to the king\u2019s own gentleman, certain that his words would reach their target. \u201cMy master took such trouble to attend these festivities, and this is the welcome he is offered? I wonder, what will the emperor think when he learns of his son\u2019s slighting at your nation\u2019s hands?\u201d\n\u201cIf you would, Lady Rishe?\u201d The plump king looked to be on the verge of tears.\nRishe had no obligation to accept and no desire to spend a moment longer in this country than was absolutely necessary. But acquiescence seemed the fastest way to move things along.\nAs her mind whirled, Arnold leaned in to whisper, \u201cIf you refuse to hear my suit, you won\u2019t deter me. I\u2019ll simply move on to Plan B.\u201d\nAnd that was how she found herself",

It was just the two of them.\n\u201cI want to know what you\u2019re planning,\u201d Rishe said flatly.\n\u201cPlanning? Me?\u201d\n\u201cBy asking me to marry you. You don\u2019t know me. A proposal like this wouldn\u2019t come out of the blue.\u201d\nThis man was destined to become an aggressive warmonger over the next few years. He wouldn\u2019t do anything without a dozen motives.\nPrince Arnold just smiled. \u201cI have no plans. I\u2019m simply enamored with you.\u201d\n\u201cEnamored\u2026?\u201d\nThat was the last thing she\u2019d expected him to say. Asking him to elaborate didn\u2019t seem worth the breath"

    "prefix_text": " them to do business with someone else could be difficult.\nI want to establish a connection with Aria as soon as possible, Rishe thought. It was, of course, the company that had taken her in during her first life.\nThe company had been established just two years prior to picking her up by its owner, a man named Tully. They were still in their growth stage, but in just a few years, they would be the grandest trading company in all the world. They\u2019d proven a great boon in her life as an apothecary as well, helping to distribute her newest medicines. She\u2019d struggled to win their trust initially, but she pledged to work much harder this time around.\nThis marriage isn\u2019t going to happen\u2014I need an escape plan for when it all falls apart. I must bring to bear all my knowledge and influence as a crown princess.\nRishe didn\u2019t know Arnold\u2019s plans, but she had no intention of sitting around and waiting for him to use her as he pleased. She\u2019d spend her time as his consort wisely. Everything must serve her ultimate goal: to live longer than five years, and live well.\nHer fierce determination must have shown on her face because Arnold gave her a little bemused smile. \u201cYes?\u201d\nGod! Rishe grimaced at that flawlessly handsome countenance. Such beauty, possessed by such powerful destruction. The fact that he\u2019d been the man to kill her did nothing to lessen her fascination. In fact, it almost made it worse. The study of contrasts.\n\u201cSorry, I just\u2014\u201d\nShe was interrupted by the horses\u2019 loud whinnies.\n\u201cStop! Hey, stop the coach!\u201d\nShouts drifted back from conveyance ahead of theirs, which contained the luggage and attendants. The squadron of knights tailing the column of coaches sped off toward the front.\n\u201cWho do you think you\u2014graaargh!\u201d\nThat didn\u2019t sound good. Rishe moved to climb out, but Arnold was faster. He drew his sword.\n\u201cHey!\u201d\nArnold locked the door from the outside. \u201cStay hidden.\u201d\nWhy is he putting himself in danger? That\u2019s what knights are for! The fact that Rishe had been about to do the same thing didn\u2019t occur to her. It\u2019s probably bandits. He told me to stay hidden in here, but I\u2019m not so sure about that.\nArnold had left her locked in from the outside, hoping to keep her safe, but Rishe didn\u2019t like her odds. There were five coaches, but this one was certainly the grandest. It locked on the inside as well, but that wouldn\u2019t stop someone with enough determination. If she did as she was told, she\u2019d just be waiting patiently for a bandit to break a window and drag her out.\nKeeping one eye on the coachmen fleeing into the forest, Rishe began a methodical search for something to help her. Right\u2014her hairpin!\nThis sure brings me back. She unfastened it, twisting it into the gap in the door. Back when I was a maid, my lady would lock herself in her chambers all the time to avoid her studies. I had to break her out just like this.\nThe lock on the coach was simple, and it came open easily. Once she was free, she scanned her surroundings. She didn\u2019t see anyone who looked immediately hostile, but there was noise up ahead. Cautiously, she headed toward it.\nBefore long, she found Arnold.\nWow.\nRoughly ten men\u2014the bandits, she presumed\u2014lay crumpled on the ground. In their midst stood Arnold, in the process of tripping another man into the dirt. He scowled, blade at the man\u2019s throat. \u201cIs that it, then?\u201d\n\u201cGwugh!\u201d\nArnold kicked the bandit in the stomach, eyes blazing with cruelty. \u201cThat\u2019s all the thrill you offer me after I went to the trouble of drawing my sword? Barely worth it. I\u2019m bored already.\u201d\nHe wasn\u2019t angry; on the contrary, he stared his enemies down with chilly disappointment, as if this had all been a letdown. Even Arnold\u2019s own knights seemed terrified of their master when he was in a mood. Arnold smoothly flicked the blood off his sword, wiping the blade on the bandit\u2019s shirt before sheathing it. The rest of the men on the ground seemed to be unconscious.\nWait, he didn\u2019t kill anyone? Why not? Is it because we haven\u2019t reached Galkhein?\nShe supposed even Arnold knew better than to go around killing the citizens of other countries. Or perhaps he had yet to become the ruthless monster she knew him as.\nArnold seemed to sense her gaze, turning around with a start. Genuine emotion bloomed on his face, worlds away from the blank mask he wore to face down the bandits. \u201cHow did you get out of the coach?\u201d\nRishe shrugged. \u201cIf I tell you, you\u2019ll be able to prevent me from doing it again.\u201d\nArnold snickered. \u201cYou continue to amaze me.\u201d\nHow can you go from ice-cold to suddenly looking like a normal nineteen-year-old? It\u2019s disconcerting. \nRishe fought down her disquiet as a man alighted from a coach and shouted, \u201cYour Highness! Not again!\u201d He was Oliver, one of the prince\u2019s attendants. He had silver hair and was roughly as tall as Arnold.\n\u201cWhat do you think all these knights are for, decoration? Why do you insist on endangering yourself?\u201d\nRishe had only met Oliver briefly a few days ago, but he didn\u2019t appear to be intimidated by Arnold at all. And, well\u2026he\u2019s not wrong.\nShe feared the menace would return to Arnold\u2019s expression, but he just looked annoyed. \u201cI could tell they were prepared to kill. I\u2019d prefer to take the burden on myself than risk multiple injuries so far afield. And we already have casualties.\u201d\nHe was right. Several injured knights leaned listlessly among the trees. Arnold issued orders to those still able-bodied. \u201cFirst squad, see to the wounded. Second squad, arrest these men.\u201d\n\u201cYes, sir!\u201d\nOliver appeared unsatisfied. \u201cYour Highness, that is a weak justification. I\u2019m overjoyed you\u2019re well, but you must consider Lady Rishe. Perhaps next time we run into a team of murderous brigands, you could allow your consort to remain in the coach.\u201d\n\u201cI told her to remain in the coach!\u201d\nRishe quickly averted her gaze, turning her attention to the wounded knights. They didn\u2019t appear badly injured, yet they all seemed exhausted.\n\u201cExcuse me, can I take a look?\u201d Rishe approached the knight acting as a medic. He looked round, startled by her presence.\n\u201cNonsense, my lady. Don\u2019t trouble yourself, you must have had quite a scare.\u201d\nThis was not unreasonable, but the wariness in his eyes made it clear he wanted her nowhere near his comrade. He isn\u2019t just being polite. He truly is on guard. \nBeside them, an injured knight groaned as another helped him up. \u201cWhat\u2019s wrong with you?\u201d the second knight asked the first. \n\u201cI-I feel\u2026numb.\u201d\n\u201cWhat? Damn.\u201d The knight grabbed up one of the fallen bandit\u2019s swords, going pale as he inspected the blade. \u201cYour Highness, look at this. Poison.\u201d\nArnold clicked his tongue. \u201cLocate every laceration and bind them close to the heart. Suck the poison from the wounds.\u201d\nHe mostly got that right, at least. In the meantime, Rishe located the nearest bound bandit and pulled his dagger out of its sheath. Its wet coating gleamed in the sunlight, just as the knight had said.\nThey applied the poison liberally\u2014whatever it is must be cheap and easily bought in bulk.\nShe wafted the smell toward her, bracing for something rancid, but detected nothing. Then she brought it closer to her nose.\nIt smells sweet, like an overripe apple. Shea grass and\u2026bluecap mushrooms. All the knights appear to have the same symptoms, so I won\u2019t have to check every blade.\nRishe stood back up and headed for the coach.\nOliver took a step after her. \u201cYour Highness, Lady Rishe is\u2014\u201d\n\u201cLeave her. She may do as she pleases.\u201d\n\u201cShe\u2019s well trained,\u201d Oliver mused. \u201cBut a battlefield is no place for a young lady. She probably wasn\u2019t prepared for such a dreadful spectacle.\u201d\nRishe ignored the murmurs and focused on her work. There they are. I\u2019ll take these, these, and\u2026\n\u201cThe poison must be a sleeping drug,\u201d she overheard Arnold saying. \u201cHunters use such drugs to weaken larger prey. I doubt this dose is lethal.\u201d\n\u201cBut it certainly is annoying,\u201d replied Oliver. \u201cWe\u2019re still two days out from Galkhein. Lugging a company of sleeping men in armor won\u2019t be pleasant.\u201d\n\u201cWe\u2019ll have to stop somewhere nearby. A hunter\u2019s settlement. Perhaps they will have an antidote\u2014\u201d\n\u201cExcuse me.\u201d Rishe, who\u2019d returned from the carriage, raised a hand. \u201cI have an antidote.\u201d\n\u201cWhat?\u201d\nThe entire company stared at her in awe.\n \n***\n \nAs it turned out, Arnold\u2019s guess was right. \nThis sweet-smelling substance was a hunter\u2019s drug, made from ingredients that were only toxic in their raw form. Heat rendered them harmless. Rishe had encountered this poison several times before, curing a customer afflicted with it during her life as an apothecary.\n\u201cA lethal dose for a grown man would fill a wine glass. They likely got less than a hundredth of that,\u201d Rishe explained to Arnold, not looking up from her work. \u201cStill, the numbness can block their airways with the roots of their tongues. It\u2019s best to lay them on their sides.\u201d\n\u201cYes, I understand the theory and the solution.\u201d Arnold gazed down at Rishe\u2019s hands. \u201cThe part I\u2019m struggling with is why you\u2019re the one telling me this.\u201d\n\u201cWell, I know how to make the antidote,\u201d Rishe said patiently as she muddled the herbs together in the white soup bowl she\u2019d borrowed for her flowers. She crushed them with the back of a spoon before adding another dried flower, crushing that as well, and combining them to form a paste. This process would be easier with a pestle, but she wasn\u2019t about to complain. \u201cThis poison is common\u2014it\u2019s cheap and easy to make, which often means the antidote is simple as well.\u201d\nThe antidote was synthesized, in fact, when hunters witnessed a deer showing no symptoms after eating a certain mushroom. They tested those along with other common herbs the deer ate. Rishe mentally thanked them for their scientific rigor as she added a bit of water, straining it all through a cloth.\nRishe stood up, brandishing the bowl of bright green medicine. \u201cBoiling would make the antidote more potent, but this works in a pinch.\u201d\nThat was when she noticed the astonished stares. Unsure of what social faux paus she\u2019d perpetrated, she looked away. Oliver was completely stunned. Arnold looked thoughtful. It was imperative the knights were treated as soon as possible, but to Rishe\u2019s dismay, no one was moving. \nDo they not trust me? That makes sense. Anyone would be reluctant to use medicine concocted by a complete stranger. But the longer we wait, the harder the poison will become to cure. \nShe needed to dispel their doubts. Rolling up her sleeve, Rishe approached Arnold and drew his sword from its scabbard. \u201cI need to borrow this for a moment, Your Highness.\u201d\n\u201cWhat are you\u2014\u201d\nShe pushed the blade against the soft skin of her inner arm. Blood welled up, along with the sharp sting of pain. Nothing compared to her injuries sustained during her life as a knight, though.\nArnold did not share her nonchalance. \u201cWhat do you think you\u2019re doing?!\u201d\nHe grabbed for her arm. She stepped out of his grasp. Was blood truly so shocking? She didn\u2019t have the time to worry about it. Clutching the overfull bowl, Rishe hurried back to the knights.\n\u201cDon\u2019t worry. This isn\u2019t poison,\u201d Rishe said. She demonstrated as much by drizzling it with a spoon over her own fresh wound. It stung. That meant the ingredients were working.\n\u201cThis is crushed liquori grass, luqua flowers, and carilya nuts. I\u2019ll swallow some if that\u2019s what it takes to prove it\u2019s safe.\u201d It was horribly bitter; she hoped it wouldn\u2019t come to that. \u201cThe paralysis will last for days. Please make up your mind quickly.\u201d\n\u201cMake up our mind?\u201d\n\u201cWill you allow me to cure the poison? Or would you rather drag paralyzed soldiers all the way to Galkhein? I suppose you could waste His Highness\u2019s time searching for a hunter\u2019s settlement to use their antidote.\u201d She smiled serenely. \u201cIt makes no difference to us. Right, Your Highness?\u201d\nIn the end, Rishe applied the antidote.\nThe recovery took a few hours. While they waited, Rishe picked herbs in the same meadow she\u2019d been gazing at with yearning from the carriage. A fortuitous turn of events. She found anti-inflammatory herbs and flowers to ease sour bellies, ingredients for curing headaches, and mushrooms for inducing slumber. She wrapped them all up in a handkerchief.\nIn the meantime, Arnold dispatched a messenger to this region\u2019s lord, making arrangements to deliver the apprehended bandits. After coordinating with Oliver, he drifted over to Rishe.\n\u201cI see your interest in flowers is mercenary, rather than ornamental,\u201d he said, surveying the heaps of herbs gathered on the bank of the pond. He sat down beside her.\nWhen he didn\u2019t say anything more, Rishe went back to work plucking leaves from plants with valuable stems. The leaves had no medicinal effects, but they did make a decent broth. Slumber mushroom spores were a nuisance unless dried; they were spread out beside her in the sun.\nI wonder, would he be annoyed if I attached herbs to the roof of the coach? That would be unusual adornment for a crown prince\u2019s retinue, but it wouldn\u2019t hurt to ask.\nShe realized, quite suddenly, that Arnold was looking at her. At her hands, specifically. He sat cross-legged with his chin propped on his fist, staring absently, like a kid watching a column of ants march by.\nWhat is so fascinating about herbs?\nTheir eyes met. \u201cAm I bothering you?\u201d he asked.\nRishe shook her head slowly. \u201cNot at all. I was just curious what caught your eye.\u201d\n\u201cNothing specific. I was just thinking how very unusual you are.\u201d He was smiling again. \u201cI\u2019m looking forward to how you\u2019ll surprise me next.\u201d\nLike I\u2019m some sort of rare pet he bought to entertain him. She didn\u2019t like that. Nothing she\u2019d done was at all remarkable\u2014normal tasks performed by a normal person.\n\u201cI didn\u2019t make that antidote for your amusement.\u201d\n\u201cI realize that.\u201d The instigating smile faded from his lips. \u201cYou know, those knights you coerced into taking your home-brewed medicine were all born in the slums.\u201d\n\u201cCoerced? That\u2019s hardly the word I\u2019d use.\u201d\n\u201cGalkhein claims to value merit above all else, but in the end, people are judged by where they came from. Despite this, those men fought their way up from nothing.\u201d\nRishe paused in plucking the seeds from a flower and looked up at Arnold.\n\u201cThe men with the worst cases of the paralysis were all newly assigned. They\u2019ve spent weeks training to ensure this mission was a success. That older knight\u2014the one who bowed to you\u2014sustained an injury protecting the rookies. He cares deeply about his men.\u201d\n\u201cYou seem to care about them too,\u201d Rishe commented.\n\u201cI handpicked them for my retinue.\u201d Arnold clambered to his feet, only to fall into a bow. \u201cAnd you kept them safe. You have my deepest gratitude.\u201d\nRishe found herself at a loss for words. Was this Arnold putting on a mask to hide the monster within? Or was this the real him? She remembered the way he\u2019d looked when he held his blade to the bandit\u2019s throat, like a child poised to break a toy he had grown bored of.\n\u201cDon\u2019t mention it,\u201d Rishe said, uncomfortable. \u201cI knew how to do it, so I did.\u201d\nArnold laughed softly. \u201cBe that as it may, I\u2019d still count a noblewoman who can brew remedies from wildflowers by the side of the road a rare find.\u201d\n\u201cEarlier, when you grabbed my wrist\u2026\u201d Rishe steered the subject away from her incongruous knowledge. \u201cYou broke your promise. You said you wouldn\u2019t touch me.\u201d\n\u201cThat was reflex,\u201d Arnold protested. \u201cI thought you were going to hurt yourself.\u201d\nSuch a simple conversation, so casual. It had Rishe feeling positively peculiar.\n\u201cWhy are your knights so wary around me?\u201d she asked. \n\u201cWary? Oh, they were all at the palace when you broke your first engagement. They\u2019re most likely concerned I\u2019m bringing home a villainous jilt who will lead to my ruin. Something silly like that.\u201d\n\u201cI see.\u201d Apparently, being dumped by a prince called into question one\u2019s herbalist abilities.\n\u201cI\u2019m glad you mentioned it,\u201d Arnold went on, \u201cbecause there may be people in Galkhein who will oppose our union. I will do everything in my power to protect you, but you must bring any insults or threats to me right away.\u201d\n\u201cAre there likely to be many?\u201d\n\u201cIn theory, the crown prince may choose his own wife, but the done thing is, of course, to marry a princess. I assume a duke\u2019s daughter would have at least some ties to the royal family?\u201d\nHe assumed correctly. She was in the family tree, if a rather distant branch.\n\u201cMy father has ordered me to choose a bride from a different kingdom rather than a woman of my own land because\u2014\u201d\n\u201cOne never knows when a hostage will come in handy,\u201d Rishe finished",

If Galkhein demanded any of the countries to hand over a princess bride, then none were in a position to refuse.

Rishe had pictured decay and clutter, but it was mostly just bare. Bare and musty, but not rotten or falling apart.\n\u201cYou can do whatever you want with this place. I\u2019ll be occupied over the next few days, but feel free to use the guest apartments in the main palace if you get tired of choking to death,\u201d Arnold said before he left.\nAccording to Oliver, work had piled up while the prince was away, and it wasn\u2019t just a few things that could be dispensed with over a few days working around the clock.\nEmperor Arnold Hein\u2026 He\u2019s just a crown prince right now, but I still wish I knew what\u2019s going on in his head. For now, I\u2019ll just focus on what I can do. Like make this place livable.\nShe changed into her plainest dress and rolled up her sleeves. The knights who\u2019d remained to serve as her guard kept watch over her as she went from window to window, throwing them all open.\nIn a stroke of luck, the weather was good, and the detached wing was well placed to soak up the sun. The lack of any creature comforts made it look ascetic and drab, but once it was furnished, Rishe had no doubt it would be lovely.\nLeaving the top floors to air out, Rishe found the stairs to the basement. She pushed the heavy wooden doors open, and mice skittered over her feet. The knights yelped as Rishe descended into the darkness.\n\u201cL-Lady Rishe, why are you going down here?\u201d\n\u201cCleaning supplies are usually kept in the basement. See?\u201d\nThe knights followed her gaze to a duster, broom, dustpan, and pile of fresh cloths. She filled a bucket with water and went to work, rolling up a handkerchief to cover her mouth as she swept dust down from high on the walls. Then she swept up all the dust on the floor.\nIt\u2019s always satisfying to tackle a place this filthy.\nShe corralled the dust bunnies until they were piled up like snow in the center of the hall, and then she swept them out the open door. Once the floors were free of debris, she attacked them with the cloth.\n\u201cLady Rishe, is there anything we can do to help?\nRishe was grateful for the knight\u2019s offer, but she shook her head. \u201cYour job is to guard me, not do my housekeeping.\u201d\n\u201cThis is quite the place to clean on your own, detached though it may be,\u201d the knight said hesitantly. \u201cIt\u2019s not too late to move into the guest chambers instead.\u201d\n\u201cThat\u2019s all right. I like the place already.\u201d\nRishe remained steadfast in her refusal for one reason: readying guest chambers was an awful chore. The palace maids would be expected to work overnight to prepare them, even if the guests were only staying a single night. No speck of dust or strand of hair could remain. Certainly no wrinkled sheets. Rishe knew how exhausting and rigorous a maid\u2019s job was, how nerve-racking.\nShe refused to put the poor dears through such an ordeal for just a few days\u2019 stay. From the sound of things, the palace wasn\u2019t equipped with many housemaids. No doubt they already had their hands full.\n\u201cBesides, take a look.\u201d She held out her arms wide, gesturing to her sparkling clean floor. The knights stared at the bright room in admiration. \u201cCleaning a place with your own hands makes living there that much more satisfying, you see.\u201d\nThe knights smiled their awkward but good-natured agreement.\nRishe worked tirelessly, and before long, the chambers where she would spend the night were ready. The knights offered to carry in the bed, which she allowed.\nWhile they brought in furniture, Rishe started cleaning another room. She had run out of clean water, so she quietly slipped out to the well without informing the knights. It wasn\u2019t quite fair to them, but these were the palace grounds. Surely she didn\u2019t need to be chaperoned everywhere.\nBesides, they\u2019re guards in name only. They\u2019re clearly just here to report my movements to Arnold Hein, Rishe reflected as she walked through a courtyard full of flowers, bucket in hand. Iridescent butterflies cavorted playfully around her feet. He doesn\u2019t seem in a hurry to introduce me to the king. Although if I\u2019m just a hostage, that doesn\u2019t surprise me.\nShe hoped she got to meet the current emperor at least once. The future Arnold\u2019s violent conquest only began after he killed the man and made himself emperor, after all.\nI wonder what happened to Arnold Hein after I died in my past life. Did he reign supreme after winning his war? Or did some country manage to put a stop to his conquest? Whatever the case, I absolutely cannot allow him to start a conflict this time. Being the empress of a wartime nation sounds like so much work! The very thought is unacceptable!\nPerhaps they could divorce, but Rishe had a feeling that if Arnold decided to discard her in the middle of a war, she would fail in her mission to make it past the age of twenty. Better to avoid the situation all together.\nWait. When she thought about it, the cause of every single one of Rishe\u2019s deaths was Arnold and his war. I died fighting. I died when Galkhein\u2019s army invaded\u2026\nLooking at her six lives, all of them had ended in more or less the same way.\nRishe found herself crouched on the ground, cradling her head in her hands. Maybe we should get a divorce right now. But it wasn\u2019t in Rishe\u2019s nature to take back her decisions once she\u2019d made them. \nIf I leave, I\u2019ll probably just die in some war-related disaster again. If I can\u2019t live apart from him, I should take this opportunity to learn everything that I can. \nRishe didn\u2019t know the cause of her repeating lives, but there was no guarantee that the loops were infinite. She had to operate under the possibility that this life could be her last. This required some thought, but standing around seething with anxiety wouldn\u2019t help.\nRight now I\u2019ll focus on cleaning. Once the bath is here, I\u2019ll scrub off all the dust and travel exhaustion. And then I can finally relax! \nBrimming with new determination, she stood up and headed for the well. She was forestalled by the sound of jeering giggles. \n\u201cAww, look at the new girl, trying so hard,\u201d said one voice.\n\u201cAll the enthusiasm in the world won\u2019t make a difference,\u201d said another. \u201cWe\u2019re going to be the crown princess\u2019s maids, not you.\u201d\nThe first added, \u201cHey, are you even listening? Stop wasting your time!\u201d\nRishe heard a weak scream, followed by a thump, like a body hitting the ground. She broke into a run, finding a blonde girl sprawled in the dirt, surrounded by four other women.\n\u201cAre you all right?\u201d Rishe hurried over to help the girl up. Her maid\u2019s uniform\u2014a loose navy-blue dress with a white apron\u2014was smeared with mud. The others were dressed identically.\n\u201cWho are you?\u201d one of the girls snapped at Rishe. She had a mop of blazing-red hair. \u201cAnother newbie?\u201d\nAn understandable mistake. Rishe\u2019s dress was simple, free of ornamentation, and her hair was bound back in a ponytail to keep it out of the way. She was dust-streaked, sweaty, and carrying a bucket in her arms.\nTelling them who I am will be more trouble than it\u2019s worth. Her silence only angered the girls more.\n\u201cAre you one of the crown princess\u2019s maids? They\u2019ve been snatching up every new girl. Those pretty hands of yours don\u2019t look like they\u2019ve ever held a broom,\u201d said one of them.\n\u201cUnfortunately for you, we\u2019ve been working here three years, and we\u2019ll be the ones to serve Prince Arnold as the maids of his palace.\u201d\n\u201cCan you stand? Oh, good, it looks like you\u2019re not injured.\u201d Rishe helped the girl up out of the dirt. \n\u201cHey, don\u2019t ignore us!\u201d the redheaded maid shouted. \u201cYou\u2019ve got some nerve. If you want to make it here, you\u2019ll know your place!",
    "query_text": " I doubt the two of you will last a week!\u201d\nRishe didn\u2019t respond, her attention snagging on something else. The redhead was carrying curtains, probably to bring them to the wash. Rishe stared at them so hard the maid began to shift uncomfortably. \u201cWhat\u2019s your problem?\u201d\n\u201cYou should wait to wash those,\u201d Rishe said.\nThe girl glared daggers at her. \u201cExcuse me? Are you telling me it\u2019s too late in the day? You really are an amateur! The light lasts longer in the spring, you know. And it\u2019s hot today. There\u2019ll be plenty of\u2014\u201d \n\u201cIt\u2019s going to rain, is all"

Or a merchant weeding out potential merchandise from a wide array of choices.\nIn other words, he was appraising her.\nOliver moved into a deep, sweeping bow. \u201cMy sincerest apologies, my lady. I have been unaccountably rude to my lord\u2019s consort. My behavior was unacceptable.\u201d\nRishe shook her head. \u201cPlease don\u2019t, it\u2019s fine.\u201d It wasn\u2019t unreasonable for the prince\u2019s closest attendant to be wary of strangers. But it did make her curious. \u201cHow long have you worked for Arnold? Have you always been a valet?\u201d\n\u201cI trained as a squire, actually,\u201d Oliver replied. \u201cBut I was injured and dismissed from the order. His Highness took me into his household soon after. I have served him for nearly a decade.\u201d\n\u201cThen maybe you can answer this,\u201d Rishe said. \u201cWhy is Prince Arnold so very intent on making me his wife?\u201d\nOliver hesitated, as if weighing the pros and cons of speaking, \u201cTo be quite honest, I was as surprised as you were. He\u2019s always insisted he had no interest in marriage. But the sight of you in Hermity has changed his mind. Apparently.\u201d\nSo not even his attendant understood his motives. Rishe remained at a complete loss.\n\u201cIf I may, however?\u201d Oliver mistook Rishe\u2019s confusion for anxiety and added, \u201cI have served Prince Arnold for a long time, and never before have I seen him so happy. When he is with you, he laughs. His smiles are sincere.\u201d\nRishe was taken aback. She\u2019d figured all of Arnold\u2019s laughter and teasing was at her expense. His own private jokes.\n\u201cAre you\u2026unhappy with him?\u201d Oliver ventured. \u201cWith his looks, His Highness is exceedingly popular with the ladies of the court, you know.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m sure he has many admirers.\u201d She paused. \u201cWould you really call the way he acts around me \u2018happy\u2019? To me, it seems more like a cat with a mouse.\u201d\nOliver laughed. He didn\u2019t deny it. \u201cI am pleased you understand His Highness so well. Oh, I nearly forgot. Here.\u201d\nHe held out a sheaf of three documents. \u201cThis is the guest list for your wedding. His Highness bids you look over it.\u201d\n\u201cThank you,\u201d Rishe said, pleasantly surprised. She hadn\u2019t even needed to ask. She gave it a quick glance, quickly identifying the most prominent and powerful names.\nKing Zahad, Prince Kyle, Princess Harriet. And from the Kingdom of Domana, we have Lord Jonal attending as the representative of the king. No surprise there.\nMore than a wedding guest register, this was a list of key people from the countries Arnold would go on to antagonize. Even before the murder of the king and the start of the war, there must have been a trigger\u2014a sea change in the affairs of state. Everyone on this list was most likely involved.\nKing Zahad. I hope we can be friends again like in my first life. Hmm\u2026 Prince Kyle is rather frail. I hope he isn\u2019t working himself too hard. He has a strong sense of responsibility\u2014he\u2019ll attend the wedding even though it\u2019ll be a long trip.\nThe sight of these names filled Rishe with a longing for those lives, for the people she\u2019d once known. And sometime in the very near future, they would all be Galkhein\u2019s enemies.\nIf I take matters into my own hands, perhaps I can salvage some of these relationships before they sour. Even if we aren\u2019t allies, we don\u2019t have to be enemies. Anything to stave off the outbreak of war.\nOliver had no idea what was going through Rishe\u2019s head. Brightly, he continued their conversation. \u201cThe ceremony will be held in three months\u2019 time. All preparations must be complete by then. And now\u2026we need to discuss tonight\u2019s party.\u201d\n\u201cTonight\u2019s what?\u201d\nOliver stiffened. \u201cDid His Highness not tell you?\u201d\n\u201cNo, he most certainly did not! There\u2019s to be a party?\u201d\n\u201cUgh, not again!\u201d Oliver dug his knuckles into his forehead.\nRishe put two and two together. She hesitated, then said, \u201cSo there is one, then. As you must know, His Highness is trying to stamp it down without telling me.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d Oliver replied. \u201cHe should have mentioned it to you. You don\u2019t need to attend, but he will. At least, I hope he will. I think I managed to convince him.\u201d\nShe sympathized with Oliver. Under normal circumstances, it would be unheard of for the crown prince and his fianc\u00e9e to fail to appear at a banquet. \u201cDon\u2019t worry, Oliver. I\u2019ll go.\u201d\nOliver let out a sigh of relief. \u201cReally? Thank you so much, my lady. I\u2019ll put finding you a maid at the top of my to-do list.\u201d\n\u201cNo need.\u201d Rishe smiled. \u201cI can prepare for the party on my own.\u201d\nThis maid-selection process made Rishe uneasy. After witnessing that exchange between the servants in the garden, she imagined quarrels breaking out all through the palace. And she doubted the disputes would go away even after they decided.\nOliver frowned. \u201cBut won\u2019t dressing be difficult without a lady\u2019s maid?\u201d \nShe shook her head. \u201cI can do my hair and put on a gown by myself. I brought dresses and cosmetics from home. Don\u2019t worry.\u201d\nRishe ignored Oliver\u2019s stunned look, already reevaluating her cleaning plans.\n \n***\n \nThe first thing Rishe said to Arnold that night was, \u201cYour Highness, I have a request.\u201d Her gown rustled as she leaned in close. \u201cI would like some herb seed and a corner of the gardens. I made a list. I hope we can discuss this in more detail later.\u201d\nArnold was silent a moment. \u201cRishe.\u201d\n\u201cWhat? Didn\u2019t you tell me to let you know if there was anything I wanted?\u201d She looked at him quizzically, and Arnold sighed.\nShe\u2019d heard that he\u2019d finished his mountain of work and even managed to sleep for a while. He was dressed in his usual military black, trimmed with a red mantle and black gloves.\nArnold shook his head. \u201cThat\u2019s not what I mean. I\u2019m guessing that Oliver didn\u2019t tell you the reason for this party? It\u2019s merely for appearance\u2019s sake. I need to look like I\u2019m searching for a bride within our borders as well. There\u2019s no reason for you to attend.\u201d\nIt made sense. The crown prince\u2014the greatest catch in the kingdom\u2014marrying a foreigner without even the slightest nod to propriety would invite unwanted discontent from the nobility.\n\u201cHowever, we\u2019re betrothed,\u201d Arnold said. \u201cThis whole evening is merely a formality. And with news that you\u2019re my \u2018hostage\u2019 going around, you\u2019ll be an object of curiosity. I don\u2019t want to put you through that.\u201d\n\u201cWell, I already went to the trouble of getting ready.\u201d Rishe plucked at her soft blue dress, draped in fluttering layers around her like a flower bud. She\u2019d braided her hair, decorating it with accessories. Her makeup was light, her shoes polished to a mirror shine. Her only jewelry was a pair of pearl earrings.\n\u201cRishe\u2026\u201d\n\u201cYour Highness, the court may consider my status as a captive princess shameful in the extreme, but I don\u2019t.\u201d She\u2019d chosen this course, after all.\nArnold was again watching her with a mixture of wonder and confusion.\n\u201cSo don\u2019t worry,\u201d she said, extending her hand. \u201cFeel free to show off your fianc\u00e9e.\u201d\nArnold relented, his dashing smile creeping out once again. \u201cVery well. I should take advantage of this opportunity to touch my betrothed.\u201d\n\u201cWe\u2019re wearing gloves.\u201d\nArnold took Rishe\u2019s hand.\nA throng of guests was gathered in the ballroom as a group of musicians performed on a platform. Women in gowns stood clustered, while gentlemen in military attire grouped together. A mere glance was enough to tell their clothes were of the highest quality. They mingled happily, making small talk with glasses in hand.\nRishe let her hand rest on Arnold\u2019s arm as she paused at the threshold to take it all in. \u201cThis is a bigger event than I was expecting.\u201d\n\u201cIs it? I\u2019d say it\u2019s a rather small gathering, actually.\u201d\n\u201cMaybe for a military powerhouse,\u201d Rishe muttered. \nYet another reminder of Galkhein\u2019s wealth took her off guard. Arnold just looked bored.\n\u201cThe size doesn\u2019t matter,\u201d he said. \u201cIn the end, they\u2019re only here for gossip. Look, here they come.\u201d\nIn the blink of an eye, they were surrounded by guests.\n\u201cPrince Arnold, thank you for gracing us with an invitation,\u201d said one man. \u201cSuch a pleasure.\u201d \n\u201cThe pleasure is mine, Lord Abel,\u201d Arnold drawled.\n\u201cYour Highness! We were so glad to hear of your safe return,\u201d another guest chirped. \u201cPlease, our daughter is simply dying to be regaled with tales of your trip.\u201d\n\u201cI can\u2019t imagine I\u2019d have anything particularly exciting to share with her,\u201d Arnold said curtly.\nAfter the last few days, Rishe found this look of glazed apathy disturbing. His good looks only compounded it\u2014he was so handsome that every expression was stark.\nHe looks more like Emperor Arnold Hein now, but still not the same.\nArnold appeared to notice her watching him. When he looked at her, his sourness disappeared, replaced by a genuine smile. All around him, women found themselves flushing. Arnold paid no heed to their fervent gazes, instead leaning in to give Rishe a brief moment of consideration.\nThen he leaned in close enough to kiss her.\n\u201cA dull trip,\u201d he said again, pulling away. \u201cBut fortuitous. Without it, I would have never met the woman destined to be my wife.\u201d\nA shocked murmur rolled through the crowd. Rishe, who hadn\u2019t recovered from seeing Arnold\u2019s beautiful face at close range, barely noticed the looks of utter loathing the assembled women were throwing her.\n\u201cH-His Highness is smiling? At his hostage bride?\u201d\n\u201cHe called her his wife?! He\u2019s never even looked at us!\u201d\nThey were whispers, but they carried.\nA portly man stepped forward with his daughter in tow. \u201cYour Highness, do you mean to say that this lovely young woman is your fianc\u00e9e?\u201d\nEvery eye in the ballroom was on Rishe, alight with curiosity, envy, or schemes. None of them could hide their contempt. But Rishe didn\u2019t falter.\nThis is nothing compared to being publicly dumped in a banquet hall. And I\u2019ve done that seven times!\nShe offered a polite smile and an astoundingly correct curtsy. Left leg at a diagonal behind the right, back straight, head bowed. \u201cHow do you do? My name is Rishe Irmgard Weitzner.\u201d\nEven the most hostile guests could find nothing impolite in her greeting, no sign of rough manners from the rustic daughter of a backwater nation. Rishe had years of training in expectation of ascending to the throne. Occasionally, habits from her other lives slipped through, but Arnold appeared to be the only one who noticed.\nNow he was looking at her with satisfaction. \u201cLady Rishe has only just arrived, and her acquaintances are few and far between. I hope I can count on you all to hold me accountable should I prove an incompetent husband.\u201d\n\u201cB-but of course, Your Highness.\u201d\n\u201cCome, Ris",
    "query_text": "he.\u201d Arnold guided her out of the ring of spectators. The stares continued to follow them as they walked away.\nRishe dropped her voice to a whisper. \u201cYou sure know how to invite the ire of women.\u201d\n\u201cWhatever do you mean?\u201d\n\u201cThe way you harped on about me. Everything you said was tailor-made to stoke their jealousy. You\u2019ve gained me enemies, so thanks for that.\u201d\nArnold snorted. \u201cEverything I said was to protect you from enemies. They need to know you aren\u2019t just some trophy they can eliminate without recourse. We need to show them this to forestall any potential moves against you in the future.\n\u201cShow them what, exactly?\u201d\n\u201cThat I\u2019ll protect you no matter what.\u201d\nHe said it with such nonchalance that"

    "prefix_text": " pretty face, Lady Toona. Why don\u2019t you smile?\nRishe leaned in close to Cornelia. \u201cThis vintage isn\u2019t available where I\u2019m from. I\u2019m ever so anxious to learn more. Should I perhaps invite Prince Arnold over to enjoy a glass? Which tray did you get this from?\u201d\n\u201cWhat? Oh, um\u2026\u201d Rishe had a policy of never backing down from a fight, but it seemed Cornelia didn\u2019t share it. \u201cS-sorry, but I don\u2019t remember. Such a large hall, you see.\u201d\n\u201cA shame. I\u2019ll just give His Highness this one, then. I\u2019ll be sure to let him know who it\u2019s from.\u201d\n\u201cUh, wait!\u201d Cornelia rapidly shook her head. \u201cI-I got that glass for you, so I think you should\u2014you know what? Never mind! Maybe I should just take that\u2014oh no!\u201d\nRishe ignored the ashen-faced Cornelia, raising the glass and swallowing down a gulp. \n\u201cI-I can\u2019t believe\u2026\u201d\n\u201cSuch a spicy flavor, just as I imagined.\u201d Rishe smiled again to the assembled group\u2019s astonishment. \u201cWhat a warm welcome. I do hope the two of us can spend more time together. Perhaps\u2026a tea party?\u201d\n\u201cTh-the two of us?\u201d Cornelia stammered.\n\u201cYes. I want to know all about House Toona.\u201d\nCornelia looked flabbergasted, but she recovered herself and nodded.\nThat should do. One of Rishe\u2019s eventual plans required a plot of land in a temperate climate. House Toona\u2019s would likely be perfect, but she needed to confirm a few things with Cornelia. Never back down from a fight. Even further\u2026\nShe recalled the words of her mentor from her days as a merchant.\nDon\u2019t bother with fights you can\u2019t win.\nThe other ladies fled, fearful of this strange girl who gulped down painfully spicy wine like it was nothing. \n \n***\n \nRishe retreated to the empty balcony to enjoy the music, grimacing with every stinging mouthful of wine. She drank it in decreasing sips until Arnold joined her.\n\u201cWhat are you making that face for?\u201d\nRishe swirled the glass. \u201cDon\u2019t worry, it\u2019s not you. It\u2019s just this wine is so spicy.\u201d\n\u201cSpicy? The wine is?\u201d\n\u201cMm. It\u2019s seasoned with capsicum. I barely managed to get that first mouthful down without gagging.\u201d\nArnold swiped the glass from her hand. \u201cDon\u2019t tell me this was a poisoning attempt!\u201d\nRishe clicked her tongue in annoyance at her own lack of vigilance. No one else would be able to grab something from her so easily.\nArnold glared at the wine. \u201cYou don\u2019t need to drink this. I\u2019ll get rid of it.\u201d\n\u201cHey, give that back! They ruined a perfectly good glass of wine because of me. I\u2019m not going to waste it.\u201d She grabbed it back and took another sip, shuddering at the taste.\nArnold glowered. \u201cTell me who did this. I\u2019ll have them executed.\u201d\n\u201cDon\u2019t be ridiculous. You don\u2019t kill people like her\u2014you use them.\u201d Just the tiniest bit of wine to go, but it was getting harder to make herself drink it. She gave the glass a reproachful look, then glanced back at Arnold. \u201cOh, and I owe you an apology.\u201d\n\u201cDo you?\u201d\n\u201cI used your name to defend myself.\u201d The girls had only backed off when she threatened to tattle to Arnold. Rishe found that sort of thing inelegant in the extreme, and she was embarrassed.\nArnold sighed at Rishe\u2019s apologetic bow. \u201cThere\u2019s nothing wrong with a wife invoking her husband\u2019s name.\u201d\nRishe hesitated. \u201cWe\u2019re not married yet.\u201d\n\u201cThat\u2019s a formality. It\u2019s as good as done, if you ask me.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2026see.\u201d\nHe took her distraction as an opportunity to swipe her glass back. Instead of dumping it out, Arnold gulped the rest of it down. \n\u201cDamn, that packs a punch,\u201d he grumbled.\n\u201cI told you that!\u201d Rishe snapped. \u201cAre you all right? Let me get you some water!\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m fine. But now you\u2019ve fulfilled your obligation to the wine, haven\u2019t you?\u201d\nRishe didn\u2019t know what to say. He\u2019d helped her\u2014not by taking charge but by following her lead. Without cutting her down and telling her she was being foolish. Without rolling his eyes and dismissing her desires as trifles.\n\u201cThank you,\u201d Rishe said stiffly, which just made him laugh.\n\u201cWhat were you thinking about when we were dancing?\u201d he asked.\n\u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d\n\u201cYou were thinking about someone else, weren\u2019t you? Who?\u201d\nRishe didn\u2019t know a delicate way to say I was thinking about a future version of you I met in another life.\n\u201cHmm?\u201d His tone was oddly light, teasing even. But the gleam in his hunter\u2019s eyes said she wouldn\u2019t get away so easily.\nObviously, Rishe couldn\u2019t give him an honest answer. \u201cI wasn\u2019t thinking about anyone else. I was worried about you.\u201d\n\u201cWhy?\u201d\nThis was the closest she could come to the truth. \u201cWere you injured here?\u201d She patted her own left shoulder with her forefinger. \nArnold went silent. His left shoulder was slightly slower to react than his right\u2014if his right was at one hundred, then his left was at maybe ninety-eight. It was hardly noticeable, but Rishe had picked up on it. He was right-handed, and she wouldn\u2019t have noticed it if they\u2019d been dancing normally. \nThat, and if it hadn\u2019t been for memories from her past life.\nRishe had only managed to inflict a single injury on him. An instant, a moment\u2019s hesitation where she saw her chance and slashed left. Of course, he\u2019d shrugged off the injury and effortlessly run her through. \n\u201cHeh.\u201d Arnold finally broke his silence with grim laughter. His eyes sent shivers down her spine, cold and bewitching. In lieu of an answer, he reached for his collar, unfastening the clasp with a snap and drawing his jacket open with a rough tug.\nOh my.\nRishe drew in a breath. A great scar was engraved into the nape of his neck, just low enough to be concealed by clothing. It looked several years old. \u201cIt\u2019s an old wound. It continues to the top of my shoulder and pulls the skin taut.\u201d\n\u201cHow awful.\u201d Rishe couldn\u2019t help but reach out to gingerly touch the nape of his neck.\nArnold accepted her touch without a word. She\u2019d half expected to be slapped aside.\nHer fingers slowly traced the shape of it. She could feel the rough skin through her gloves.\nHe must have gotten this over a decade ago. Someone stabbed him\u2014and not just once or twice. They must have done it over and over to make this scar pattern.\nHer medical training had her shuddering at the image of a nine-year-old Arnold ashen and trembling with blood loss. The fact that he\u2019d survived and retained the use of his arm was incredible. And then to go on to wield a sword so skillfully\u2014his suffering must have been immense.\n\u201cOnly a few people know about this injury. You\u2019re the first to notice on your own.\u201d\n\u201cHow did it happen?\u201d\nThat grim smile returned as he looked down at Rishe. With the moon hanging behind him, he was as opaque as ever, but Rishe understood the sentiment.\nI shouldn\u2019t pry.\nRishe pulled her hand away, and that ominous smile that sent chills down her spine disappeared. Arnold put his jacket back in order, reclasping it at the neck.\nSomeone tried to kill Arnold Hein about ten years ago. But who and why? Rishe cast her eyes down as she ruminated. The most obvious beneficiaries of a dead crown prince would be potential heirs and those loyal to them. I believe Arnold has a younger brother, but I haven\u2019t met him yet.\nOdd. Rishe might be a hostage, but shouldn\u2019t she meet her future relatives? Perhaps it was Arnold\u2019s doing and not the will of the imperial family themselves. He didn\u2019t seem to want to involve her in anything unless it was absolutely necessary\u2014he hadn\u2019t told her about this ball, after all. \nRishe looked up at him. \u201cYour Highness, may I select my maids some time over the next few days?\u201d \n\u201cVery well. I\u2019ll tell Oliver to make that a priority.\u201d\n\u201cAh, I can do the selection myself. We needn\u2019t trouble him.\u201d\nArnold arched an amused brow. Gone was that unsettling smile, replaced with his easy manner. \u201cWhat are you planning this time?\u201d\n\u201cOh, nothing important,\u201d Rishe said. She picked up her empty glass. \u201cI\u2019m merely concerned about the servants\u2019 working conditions.\u201d\nTo protect her life and well-being, she needed to keep from dying at twenty years old again. And to do that, she had to prevent Arnold Hein\u2019s war. Her best bet would be to appeal to the important people she\u2019d known in her past lives. People with influence.\nPlus, there was a mountain of things she needed to do in preparation for the marriage ceremony.\nI need to sow a plot of land, grow herbs, do lots of shopping, get cheap alcohol, and then\u2026 \nRishe began a to-do list that had nothing to do with war in the least.\n \n***\n \nAs the ball wound to a close, a lone boy stood in the gloomy courtyard of the imperial palace. He had soft black hair and round blue eyes. No older than sixteen, he had an androgynous grace to him, gaze fixed on the balcony above. \nHe was watching a girl.\nShe had coral-colored hair, and even from this distance, he could tell she was beautiful. She stood there alone, apparently waiting for someone. Whoever it was must have shown up because her hand slipped from the banister, and she stepped away. Not too long after, a man appeared where she had been standing.\nThe man turned a silent glare down into the garden, as if he\u2019d known the boy had been there the whole time, despite the shadows.\nA shiver ran down the boy\u2019s spine and he smiled reflexively, delighting in the intense aura of threat the man gave off. It was just a warning, it seemed, as the man abruptly turned on his heel and disappeared. \n\u201cAww, we can\u2019t play together either?\u201d The boy hung his head. \u201cI miss you, Brother.\u201d\nIt had to be the woman. The beauty. She\u2019d made the boy\u2019s life hell since the day she arrived. \nHis brother had prohibited him from attending balls like this one. That was fine; he\u2019d sooner avoid them altogether. Still, he\u2019d wanted to meet that girl. \n\u201cBut we\u2019ll meet soon enough, won\u2019t we?\u201d He spoke to himself in a soft voice. \u201cI\u2019ve got plans for you, Sister.\u201d \n\n(2) chapter number given is likely out of range: 0\nChapter: 8\n\nChapter 3\nChapter 3\n \n\u201cYOU\u2019RE ALL SO USELESS!\u201d Diana the redheaded maid\u2019s voice rang out inside the stone washhouse. \nThree days had passed since the afternoon Rishe shook off her guard and came out to the well. Rishe was once again dressed to fit in with the maids. At Diana\u2019s shout, she looked up without pausing in her work. \n\u201cIs even laundry beyond your capabilities? I asked you to wash these this morning, and now it\u2019s past noon! Meanwhile, we\u2019ve finished cleaning the entire first floor in a third of the time!\u201d\n\u201cI-I\u2019m sorry, Diana.\u201d\nThe new maids went silent with shame. Among them was Elsie, the girl Rishe stood up for the other day. Rishe pulled her hands out of the soapy water, gently rinsed them, and said, \u201cLet me help. What still needs to be done?\u201d\n\u201cYou again?\u201d Diana rounded on Rishe. \u201cI don\u2019t know who you serve, but I\u2019m amazed you have the time to do other people\u2019s work. I wish I had so much free time.\u201d\nHuffily, she turned from Rishe. \u201cLet\u2019s just ignore these useless fools. Laura, Maya. Come on. If we want to be chosen as Lady Rishe\u2019s maids, we mustn\u2019t waste our time.\u201d\nDiana took out a slip of paper from her pocket, smoothing it out. \u201cIt looks like the new bedsheets for her palace will arrive today. We should inspect them to make sure everything is perfect!\u201d\n\u201cWait up, Diana!\u201d\nThe two maids followed Diana out. Rishe waited for the door to close before turning to Elsie and the others. \u201cLet\u2019s keep working. If there\u2019s anything too large and cumbersome, feel free to pass it over to me.\u201d\n\u201cTh-thank you so much!\u201d The new maids went weak with gratitude. One of them",
    "query_text": ", a girl on the verge of tears, even fell into a full bow. Rishe muttered encouragement as she scrubbed some bedsheets.\nElsie, who was washing the sheets with her, wore a rueful look. \u201cI\u2019m so sorry for the trouble. We\u2019re just not learning fast enough"

Very few families had the means to afford an education, especially for daughters. Diana had been born to a merchant\u2019s family\u2014she\u2019d received formal schooling. The maids she was close friends with were likely from similar backgrounds. The majority of those in service were not so fortunate.\n\u201cWhat if you only received instructions on how to do a job once and weren\u2019t able to write it down to remind yourself later?\u201d Rishe asked. \u201cWould you be so confident?\u201d\n\u201cI-I don\u2019t\u2014\u201d Diana reflexively thrust a hand into her apron pocket, where she had a list of daily tasks recorded in her neat handwriting to reference throughout the day. Hopefully now she would understand how much of an edge her privileged literacy gave her over the other maids.\n\u201cEveryone else works as hard as they can, just like you do,\u201d Rishe said. \u201cRemember how it was for you at first? They all have to start somewhere. I hope you\u2019ll keep that in mind.\u201d\n\u201cThey\u2019re no different from me,\u201d Diana mumbled begrudgingly, glancing around the room, looking at the less experienced maids. As if coming to a decision, she said, \u201cI\u2019m sorry.\u201d\n\u201cDiana?\u201d\nLike a child enumerating her regrets, Diana went on, \u201cI\u2019ve done you wrong, all of you. It\u2019s just, I had nothing. Or so it felt like. No money, no title. I thought I had to make my way in the world on my own. That I had to start from zero.\u201d Her shoulders trembled as she buried her face in her hands. \u201cBut I was wrong! I wasn\u2019t starting from zero. I had everything that I learned growing up. I didn\u2019t realize how fortunate I was. I let it all go to my he\n \n\u201cRISHE IRMGARD WEITZNER! You are a vile woman! A truly malicious creature unworthy of the crown prince! As of this instant, our engagement is off!\u201d \n\u201cAs you wish, Your Highness.\u201d\n\u201c\u2026Huh?\u201d\nThe prince\u2019s declaration echoed throughout the ballroom. Rishe, the duke\u2019s daughter, bowed in response, her coral-toned hair swaying gracefully. The assembled guests found themselves captivated by her dignified beauty. Despite having just witnessed a broken engagement, they couldn\u2019t bring themselves to pity her.\nSlowly, Rishe lifted her head and fixed the prince with a pale-emerald gaze. It caught him off guard, but he quickly recovered.\n\u201cDidn\u2019t you hear what I just said?! I\u2019m calling off our engagement! Doesn\u2019t that trouble you?\u201d\n\u201cNot really.\u201d\nRishe already knew what happened next: false accusations, exile, and her family severing all ties and leaving her to survive on her own. She turned from the prince. There was no point wasting any time.\nThis is my seventh loop, after all.\nRishe had done this all before.\nThe next few hours will be busy. I must hurry and retrieve my things before I\u2019m barred from the family estate. I don\u2019t want this to be one of the times I\u2019m too slow and I have to start my new life with nothing.\n\u201cRishe, halt and hear me! I have spent the past week perfecting my recitation of your crimes!\u201d\nI should take more than dresses this time\u2014there\u2019s plenty of things I could use out in the world. What trade should I take up? In my first life, I was a merchant. In my second, an apothecary. I\u2019ve got a few more I want to try out\u2026 Augh! If time\u2019s just going to keep resetting, I wish I could start at an earlier point. I need more time to prepare!\n\u201cWait! Rishe!\u201d\nThe crown prince was on the verge of tears, and the spectators struggled to suppress their snickers. \nA thought occurred to Rishe, and she stopped. She then turned, her eyes gleaming beneath long lashes as she stared down her ex-fianc\u00e9. \u201cAh, Your Highness, I almost forgot.\u201d \n\u201cYes, tell me!\u201d the prince fumed. \u201cLet me guess, you are hurt beyond measure and yet love me still\u2026correct?\u201d\nAs if. Rishe was grateful to be granted her freedom. In fact, she was smiling as she said, \u201cI hope you and Lady Mary are happy together.\u201d\n\u201cWhat?!\u201d\n\u201cMay we both lead fulfilling lives. Farewell!\u201d Rishe lifted the skirts of her evening gown and turned on her heel, departing as briskly as she could.\n\u201cHow do you know about Mary? I haven\u2019t told you I love her!\u201d The prince was shouting something behind her, but she paid him no mind. She had things to do.\nDuring her first loop, the prince\u2019s accusations had shocked her to the core and she\u2014foolishly so\u2014had attempted to defend herself. Now she knew better than to expect the prince to behave reasonably. \nHow will life unfold this time? I\u2019m excited to find out! Rishe fixed her mind on the future.\nThis is my seventh \u201cdo-over.\u201d I\u2019ve led happy and carefree lives before, but this time\u2014this time, I swear I\u2019ll live a long happy and carefree life!\nIn other words, she needed to avoid getting killed. At any cost. \n \n***\n \nIn the first loop, with her engagement broken and her reputation in tatters, Rishe roamed with nothing but the clothes on jewelry. Finding them a good-natured band, she hitched a ride to a neighboring country.\nFrom the merchant caravan, she learned a trade, studying how to procure stock and balance ledgers. Eventually, she set out on her own to travel the world. Her upbringing as a daughter of the nobility meant that, even at fifteen years old, Rishe possessed a keen sense for beauty.\nShe collected things that caught her eye and sold them to whoever found delight in her wares. Before she realized it, she had become a major vendor, employing a full staff. She had even done business with the king of a desert nation and the prince of a frozen country up north. She traveled to many distant places, realizing a dream born from her cossetted former life spent doing nothing but preparing to be queen.\nFive years passed, and just as she had only one country left to visit, Rishe fell victim to the war sweeping across the continent.\nThe next thing she knew, she was fifteen years old again and back at that party, with the prince poised to make his pronouncement.\n\u201cRishe Irmgard Weitzner! You are a vile woman! A truly malicious creature unworthy of the crown prince! As of this instant, our engagement is off!\u201d\nNaturally, she didn\u2019t understand what was going on at first. She looked around. Everything was the same. She stood in the same place wearing the same dress and draped in the same jewelry she\u2019d sold to the caravan.\nWas it a dream? Or was everything that had happened up until then the dream? In her confusion, all she could do was stare.\nRishe hurried out of the ballroom, the impending threat of exile hanging over her and the prince\u2019s entreaties to halt ringing in her ears.\nThis is perfect! Now I can get it right! I\u2019ll grab everything valuable from my room.\nRishe had enjoyed her life as a merchant, but she had always felt a stirring of regret about this night. If only she\u2019d brought some funds from home, she would\u2019ve had the capital to establish her business much sooner!\nSpeaking of this regret always prompted disbelief from her customers, including the king of the desert. \u201cWhat? That\u2019s what you\u2019d want to do over?!\u201d\nWhen she arrived back at home on the night of her second life, Rishe grabbed her jewelry box and as many of the books her late grandmother had left her as she could carry, then made haste to the forest to meet the caravan. But the stop at her house took time, and she missed them completely.\nIn that moment, Rishe made a stark realization. Different choices meant different mistakes. Opening one door would close another.\nAnd so the easy path to a life in commerce was closed to her.\nSure, she could try to build her business from the ground up, but personal connections were almost as essential to being a merchant as business savvy. It just wasn\u2019t realistic without a single acquaintance. \nSorting through her belongings in resignation, she came across a foreign encyclopedia of herbs among her grandmother\u2019s books. Taking it as a sign, Rishe sold her jewels elsewhere and used the funds to cross the sea and pursue the study of medicine.\nFortunately, Rishe retained all her knowledge from her previous life. She remembered that certain expensive herbs could be acquired cheaply in other regions. When word spread of a disease running rampant in a neighboring country, she recalled that too. This foreknowledge proved invaluable, as did her wide travel and exposure to many different teachers with many different points of view.\nAs such, Rishe led a successful life as an apothecary. She saved a feeble prince, synthesized a number of rare medicines with her mercantile knowledge, and thus spent her days in the simple joy of helping those in need.\nUnfortunately, all the joy in the world couldn\u2019t stand up to an epidemic. Thus ended her second life. \nOnce again, she found herself in the moment of her broken engagement, the curtain rising on the third loop. Her next four lives proceeded much the same way. As a skilled lady\u2019s maid, she helped a young noblewoman to a fortuitous marriage. Once, she even disguised herself as a man and became a knight. Every life was worth living, and she enjoyed them all. She enjoyed living, period.\nThere was just one problem.\nNo matter what I do, I die at twenty.\nShe enjoyed her lives, but she was not permitted to do so for long. With this time limit always hanging over her, she spent each loop in a state of constant activity.\nI would love to take it easy for a while. Is a little leisure time too much to ask? Obviously I don\u2019t want to die either! This time, I\u2019ll make as much money as I can in the first five years. Then, when I turn twenty, I\u2019ll live a life free of worldly cares. I\u2019ll do whatever\u2019s necessary",
    "query_text": " to stay alive!\nHer mind made up, Rishe began her seventh life in a dead sprint through the palace. Regardless of her future plans, she was in a race against time. She needed to beat the messenger bearing news of her scandal.\nAs she ran, she yanked off her hair ornaments; she planned to sell them and didn\u2019t want to risk losing one. Her hair billowed out behind her, falling in loose waves.\nSuddenly, an idea occurred to her, one she hadn\u2019t had in any of her previous six lives.\nLeaving through the palace gardens would be faster. I can climb down a tree from the balcony.\nRishe had gone to war as a knight in the life just before this one. After the punishing battlefield training, climbing trees was nothing.\nSeamlessly, she changed direction. She raced for"

    "prefix_text": "he! You\u2019ve brought my beloved Mary to tears! She\u2019s told me everything. How you bullied her, ridiculed her. How you find it amusing to lock her in the classroom overnight! Such a wicked woman could never be queen!\u201d\nNone of that\u2019s true.\nRishe glanced at Mary, who averted her gaze a little awkwardly.\n\u201cMore importantly,\u201d Rishe said, \u201chave you already brought your concerns to my parents, Your Highness?\u201d\n\u201cMore importantly?! I did, if you must know! Your parents are furious. They have vowed to disown you.\u201d\n\u201cAh. Then I\u2019m too late.\u201d Her parents held their reputation above all else. Rishe had little hope of retrieving any of her money or belongings now.\n\u201cWhy are you acting so strangely?\u201d Dietrich sniffed. \u201cAh, I understand. You\u2019re in such shock from this turn of events that\u2014\u201d\n\u201cListen, Dietrich.\u201d In her exasperation, Rishe dropped his title. \u201cI accept your decree. We are no longer engaged. I shall never darken your doorstep again. So\u2026relax a little.\u201d\n\u201cHuh? What are you saying?\u201d\n\u201cSince I was a child, I believed that my only value was in our betrothal. Being engaged to the crown prince was my whole reason for living. I was wrong about that. Only I determine my value\u2014no one else. That\u2019s why I don\u2019t care about this. I\u2019m beyond it.\u201d Rishe made sure to look him directly in the eye as she spoke. \u201cYou are an unnecessary element in my life.\u201d\nDietrich staggered back. His legs seemed to go out from under him, and he crumpled. At that, the knights finally let go of their composure, laughing along with the courtiers.\n\u201cSt-stop!\u201d the prince wailed. \u201cYou are my subjects. This\u2026this shows such flagrant disrespect!\u201d\n\u201cDietrich, don\u2019t pay them any mind,\u201d Lady Mary said. \u201cLady Rishe, is this cruelty necessary?\u201d\n\u201cPerhaps this is a blessing in disguise.\u201d Rishe\u2019s attention moved to Mary, making the girl\u2019s slender shoulders jump. She had no reason to worry; Rishe didn\u2019t bite. \u201cI\u2019ve been wanting the opportunity to speak to you, Lady Mary. You\u2019re strong. I admire you very much.\u201d\n\u201cWhat are you talking about?\u201d\n\u201cYou\u2019re a lovely girl who never fails to smile despite your troubles. You don\u2019t put up walls around your heart, and you do your utmost to put others at ease. Even now, you bravely stand before me to protect the prince.\u201d\nMary\u2019s eyes were wide with confusion. Rishe picked her words carefully, attempting to diminish the girl\u2019s guilty feelings, if only a little. \u201cYou need to marry the prince for your family\u2019s sake, right?\u201d\n\u201cHow do you\u2014?\u201d\nRishe had learned this truth in one of her past lives. Mary was born to a poor family, and she had studied like mad to be accepted into the academy to hunt for a husband. She intended to make sure neither she nor her brothers ever went hungry again.\nShe went on, \u201cRemember this: you are the one in control of your life. Don\u2019t sell it to anyone else. Can you trust a man who so easily discards the woman he\u2019s been engaged to since childhood? Do you truly believe he cares for you?\u201d\nAstonishment bloomed across Mary\u2019s face. She looked over at Dietrich, who hadn\u2019t bothered to stand up. The truth was\u2026within a year, Prince Dietrich would be in prison, his title stripped from him. He would plan a mad coup d\u2019\u00e9tat against the king, attempting to provoke the citizens to war. His plan would be discovered in its early stages, rendering him a laughingstock across the kingdom.\n\u201cYou must shape your future with your own hands\u2014you mustn\u2019t entrust your desires to others.\u201d \n\u201cMy\u2026my desires?\nRishe nodded.\nMary was looking at her like she was speaking a foreign language. \u201cBut I\u2019m their elder sister.\u201d Her voice quivered. \u201cI must endure, no matter what. Otherwise, my brothers will never be happy.\u201d\n\u201cAnd you believe their happiness can only be achieved by sacrificing your own?\u201d\nMary gasped as she gaped at Rishe.\n\u201cYou don\u2019t need to throw away your own future to protect those you love,\u201d Rishe told her. \u201cNo matter what path you choose, never forget that.\u201d\n\u201cMy future?\u201d Mary\u2019s voice went ragged, like she was barely suppressing a wail of pain.\n\u201cI wish you a life where both you and your family can be happy,\u201d said Rishe.\nMary stood frozen in place, eyes gleaming like precious stones. Rishe couldn\u2019t help but admire how pretty she was. She truly did wish her happiness. But right now, she needed to take care of herself. \n\u201cWell.\u201d Rishe suddenly broke into a smile, making Dietrich flinch. \u201cI think it\u2019s time for me to be on my way.\u201d\nShe regretted losing access to her room, but she knew her parents wouldn\u2019t let her in. Turning her back on the crowd, Rishe contemplated her next move.\n\u201cWait, Lady Rishe!\u201d Mary\u2019s voice rang out.\n\u201cThat\u2019s right. You\u2019re not going anywhere, Rishe!\u201d The prince joined her. \u201cYou won\u2019t get away with treating me like trash to relieve your own injured heart.\u201d\n\u201cUgh, enough already!\u201d Rishe\u2019s patience was fraying. \u201cI don\u2019t have anything else to say to you. Goodbye!\u201d\n\u201cKnights, stop her!\u201d\nReluctantly, the knights moved to tail Rishe as she walked briskly back down the path. She sympathized with them, but she wasn\u2019t about to let them keep her here. Rounding a corner, she sensed something uncanny. She stopped, the knights quickly catching up with her.\n\u201cMy apologies, Lady Rishe. If you could please remain for just a\u2014whoa!\u201d\nRishe grabbed the hilt of the knight\u2019s sword. Yanking it from his belt, she spun around and stood at the ready. Metal rang against metal as Rishe parried a blow. She glared at her would-be attacker as he stepped out of the shadows.\nArnold Hein!\n\u201cWell, what do you know.\u201d The man smiling so sweetly while their swords locked was the very man who had ended her life. \u201cYou do have some skill.\u201d\nMetal screeched and slid, before Arnold sheathed his sword. Rishe lowered hers. Neither looked away.\n\u201cWho the hell are you?\u201d demanded one of the knights.\n\u201cStand down, good sirs,\u201d Rishe said. \u201cYour interference will only make this worse.\u201d\nThis mostly served to befuddle the knights further. Rishe absolutely couldn\u2019t allow them to come to blows with the crown prince of a friendly nation. And they couldn\u2019t beat him\u2014not even if they took him all at once. Rishe had blocked his blow, but her arm was completely numb. To think he\u2019d be even more powerful in five years.\nHe regarded her unabashedly. \u201cRishe, was that your name? Where did you learn such swordsmanship?\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m afraid I cannot say. Besides, you were clearly going easy on me.\u201d\n\u201cHa! You could tell?\u201d\nArnold\u2019s manner was throwing her off. He seemed to be enjoying himself. He\u2019s laughing. This monstrous prince is\u2026actually laughing.\nWhen she had met him in her other life, he was cold and merciless, like a genuine monster. And yet here he stood, mellow and smiling.\nThe Emperor Arnold Hein I knew was twenty-four years old, so he\u2019s, what? Nineteen now? This is so weird. He\u2019s grinning like a boy getting into a scrape.\nThat attack had been good-natured as well, almost playful. It had muscle behind it but certainly not any lethal intent. He\u2019d just wanted to force Rishe to catch the blow. She found it unbelievable that he could exude such an overpowering air of menace when he was just messing around.\nWhile Rishe was focused on Arnold, Mary and Dietrich caught up, seemingly recovered.\n\u201cExcuse me, my lord!\u201d Mary squeaked. \u201cI-I-I don\u2019t know who you are, but kindly step away from Lady Rishe!\u201d\n\u201cYes, do as she says! Who the hell are you, anyway?!\u201d\nDon\u2019t tell me Prince Dietrich doesn\u2019t recognize one of his personal guests.\nDietrich\u2019s interests did not lean toward diplomacy; he likely hadn\u2019t bothered to introduce himself to Arnold. Mary, for her part, seemed to grasp that Arnold wasn\u2019t ordinary. She stood up to defend Rishe, despite the tremble in her voice. In a better world, perhaps the two of them could have become friends.\n\u201cThat\u2019s your ex-fianc\u00e9?\u201d Arnold cocked a brow. \u201cHe\u2019s even worse than I imagined. Pathetic.\u201d\nDietrich flushed. \u201cI\u2019ll have your head!\u201d\n\u201cDietrich, I beg of you, contain yourself,\u201d Rishe said, then rounded on Arnold. \u201cAs for you, Your Highness\u2014you know who Dietrich is, and you know what speaking carelessly could mean. Are you trying to pick a fight?\u201d\n\u201cWhatever do you mean?\u201d Arnold\u2019s brows lifted high, making him the picture of innocence. \u201cBelieve me, Lady Rishe, every word I speak is chosen with extreme care.\u201d\nFinally realizing who Arnold was, Dietrich visibly paled. \u201cArnold? He\u2019s the crown prince of Galkhein?\u201d\nMary yelped. The knights stood down, shamefaced. The gossip-hungry neighbors who\u2019d gathered to witness a scandal play out drew back in fear.\n\u201cHe\u2019s the demon prince? The one who single-handedly destroyed a whole order of enemy knights?\u201d\n\u201cWatch your tongue, fool! Do you want him to do the same to you?\u201d\nThe two nations enjoyed peaceful relations, but Arnold remained the dreaded prince, heir to the throne of a former enemy. Current rumor wasn\u2019t as widespread as it would be in five years, but he was still regarded with distrust.\nThe onlookers stood rooted to the spot, too terrified to flee.\nWell, this has devolved into a full-fledged disaster.\nRishe heaved a frustrated sigh. \u201cPrince Arnold, to what do we owe this honor? Surely a crown prince would not draw his sword for a mere jest.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m here on business,\u201d Arnold said. \u201cBut first, I must beg forgiveness for my rudeness.\u201d\nHuh, what do you know? Once he became emperor, he\u2019d gladly behead any subject who so much as dared speak a word against him.\nI guess at nineteen he still knew how to apologize.\nIf that surprised her, Arnold\u2019s next act completely obliterated her sense of reality. \nWith a flourish, he fell to his knees. \n\u201cHuh?\u201d Is this actually happening? \nHe was a man destined for an imperial crown. A man who would stand at the head of a military powerhouse and spread his rule across continents.\nArnold, known for his frigid pride, knelt to the disgraced daughter of a duke.\nAnd not only that\u2014his head was bowed, looking nothing so much as a knight swearing allegiance to his lady. If it were anyone else, it would be a delightful, pious image. Instead, the assembled looked on in terrified awe.\nNot Rishe, though.\n\u201cWhat are you doing?\u201d she hissed. \u201cGet up!\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m apologizing for my baseless impertinence. Also, I\u2019m asking you\u2026\u201d He trailed off to take Rishe\u2019s hand, tugging her forward so forcefully she staggered. He gazed up at her.\nUgh. He\u2019s so beautiful. No matter how many times she looked at him, it didn\u2019t become any less disarming. Long eyelashes, arched brows, a noble nose. His bright blue eyes reminded her of the drift ice she\u2019d seen in a northern kingdom, gazing out from a ship in one of her past lives. She knew she was dwelling on this to buy time, even as the reality before her sank in.\n\u201c\u2026to become my wife.\u201d\nShe froze, unable to process the words. \u201cWhat?\u201d Rishe glanced around, desperately searching the faces of the crowd. They all seemed as stunned as she felt. She looked down at Arnold again. \u201cYour wife?\u201d \n\u201cYes, that\u2019s right.\u201d\n\u201cYou want me to become your wife?\u201d\n\u201cYes.\u201d\nRishe couldn\u2019t speak. This was truly happening. It was real. It clicked into place in her head, and she let out a strangled grunt.\nWhat is going on? Why is this happening?\nShock lapped at her, fuzzing at the corners of her vision. He wanted to marry her. Arnold wanted to marry Rishe. Her murderer wanted to marry her.\nWhy is he doing this? He must have some ulterior motive, a broader goal. But I have to give him an answer.\nThe onlookers were holding their breath as Rishe said flatly, \u201cI reject your proposal.\u201d\nArnold said nothing.\nShe had to reject him. She was going to live a long, peaceful, carefree life, damn it, and no one would stop her. And yet\u2026\nArnold began to laugh, and the deep, creeping sense of dread inside Rishe only grew. Why does he seem so amused by this?!\n \n***\n \nHer previous life was her sixth. Disguised as a man, Rishe rose as a warrior of an island country she came upon in her travels. It was a conventional yet charming kingdom formed of red brick. After striking up a friendship with a group of knights who didn\u2019t realize she was a woman, Rishe followed their advice and joined them.\nThe training was grueling enough to make her wish she were dead. Back when she had lived as a noble, she\u2019d learned how to wield a sword for basic self-defense, but training as a noble lady had in no way prepared her for this. She drilled relentlessly, barely taking the time to sleep. Just as she became a full-fledged knight, Emperor Arnold\u2019s forces lay siege to the castle.\n \n***\n \nHow could this happen? \nIn her seventh life, Rishe wearily sank into her chair. Across from her sat Arnold, his legs crossed and chin propped up on his hand, watching her lazily.\n\u201cWhat\u2019s the matter?\u201d he asked. \u201cYou seem unhappy.\u201d\n\u201cYou could say that.\u201d Even her voice was grumpy. Still, she couldn\u2019t very well tell him it was because she bore a grudge from a previous life. After the first time her life rewound to that pivotal moment, she\u2019d resolved to keep her loops a secret. \u201cI had plans for my exile. A brand-new life. And now because of you, my parents are involved. Even the king has heard about it!\u201d\nAfter Rishe rejected Arnold, Dietrich had immediately cried out, \u201cTh-the crown prince of Galkhein proposed to Rishe?!\u201d\nHis shrieks were loud enough to attract the attention of the master and mistress of the manor.\nWhen her parents came out, Rishe had protested, \u201cI\u2019m not going to marry him! I\u2019m leaving the country just as Dietrich commanded.\u201d\nNo one listened. Their faces just paled with nervous confusion.\nJust then, a glittering coach arrived. Half-stuck in the mud, the man inside it was forced to trudge over the swampy ground, and so the king of Hermity himself arrived, staggering and dirt-stained. \nHe grabbed hold of his son\u2019s collar, pushing him into a low bow. He then turned to Prince Arnold and said, rather loudly, \u201cYour Highness! Allow me to apologize for my son\u2019s foolishness! You are an esteemed guest all the way from Galkhein! It is unthinkable he would not offer you the courtesy you are due!\u201d\n\u201cYou\u2019re hurting me, Father! My back!\u201d\nThe king then turned to Rishe. \u201cMy lady, allow me to sincerely apologize as both a king and a father. My son\u2019s behavior toward you has been utterly disgraceful. I beg you to please give Prince Arnold\u2019s proposal due consideration. Not only for your own sake but for the sake of your country.\u201d\nThe king bowed to her as deeply as his son had to Arnold, and her parents joined him. Rishe felt dizzy at the sight",
    "query_text": " of this abject debasement in the presence of citizens.\nArnold, who had been watching the proceedings with a detached amusement, sobered and stepped toward the king. \u201cYour Majesty, please rise.\u201d\nWithout the smirk, Arnold\u2019s face immediately reverted to its cold mask. The king didn\u2019t move. Maybe something in Arnold\u2019s voice kept him frozen.\n\u201cSuch a trifle won\u2019t cause discord between our kingdoms,\u201d he went on. \u201cHowever, I would beg a little time to speak with Lady Rishe.\u201d\nLater, Rishe would learn that Arnold\u2019s attendant had spoken to the king\u2019s own gentleman, certain that his words would reach their target. \u201cMy master took such trouble to attend these festivities, and this is the welcome he is offered? I wonder, what will the emperor think"

    "prefix_text": " from her, one hand outstretched. \u201cWhat do you think you\u2019re doing?\u201d she demanded.\nWhen they\u2019d boarded the coach, Rishe had warned him not to lay a single finger on her throughout the trip to his kingdom. Ordering the prince not to touch his consort was absurd, but Arnold readily agreed. He had, after all, promised to follow her every direction.\nAnd yet, here he was, already breaking his promise.\nArnold appeared unperturbed by her glare. \u201cDon\u2019t look at me like that. I was merely trying to recover what you took from me.\u201d\nConfused, Rishe looked at the sword in her hand. It had a black lacquered scabbard with a simple golden decoration. Engraved on the hilt was the Galkhein crest.\n\u201cOh!\u201d Rishe thrust the sword back at Arnold. \u201cMy apologies.\u201d\nArnold chuckled. \u201cYou caught me off guard. You were nodding off, and then you suddenly snatched up my sword. You looked quite content snuggling up with it.\u201d\nArnold propped the sword beside him. Rishe pressed a hand to her chest to quell her racing heart. The sword that gutted me in my previous life is now my bedmate. What a world. Her recent stint as a knight had left her ill at ease without a blade at hand. She just couldn\u2019t believe it was Arnold\u2019s she\u2019d reached for.\n\u201cI didn\u2019t mean to disturb you, but I doubted sleeping with a weapon would be comfortable. I\u2019m impressed you sensed my intent before I even touched you.\u201d Arnold rested one elbow against the window frame, watching her with shameless fascination. \u201cOne only develops instincts like that from combat training. And you were also a member of the court? How in the world did you find the time?\u201d\nRishe shrugged. She couldn\u2019t just say, I pretended to be a man in a previous life, that\u2019s how.\n\u201cI assume there\u2019s more to you than your devotion to the sword. You seem to like flowers.\u201d\nShe followed Arnold\u2019s gaze to where she\u2019d bundled a small bouquet in a handkerchief. This was their fifth day on the road to Galkhein. Every day, without fail, she\u2019d picked flowers whenever they stopped to water the horses. The ones from today were still fresh, but the ones she\u2019d begun drying five days ago were just about ready.\n\u201cI didn\u2019t pick these because they\u2019re pretty.\u201d Rishe brought the blooms to her face, spirits rising at their sweet scent. Spring wildflowers had a soft and gentle smell. Rishe looked out the window at the forest spreading toward Galkhein, thinking of the rare native flowers going into bloom. She wished she could pick those as well, but that would cause too much delay. She gazed on wistfully.\nAfter watching her in silence for some time, Arnold said, \u201cBy the way, I sent one of my men ahead on a fast horse to deliver your order to the company you requested. They\u2019ll be invited to Galkhein to discuss the wedding ceremony.\u201d\n\u201cThank you,\u201d Rishe said. \u201cI\u2019m glad you kept your word.\u201d\n\u201cThe Aria Trading Company,\u201d Arnold mused. \u201cI\u2019ve heard of them. They\u2019re up-and-comers, aren\u2019t they? Have you done business with them before?\u201d\n\u201cNo, but I heard from a friend that they hold a very high standard of quality.\u201d\nRishe was pleasantly surprised at how easily Arnold had acceded to her request. Typically, a royal household had their own personal dealer. Getting them to do business with someone else could be difficult.\nI want to establish a connection with Aria as soon as possible, Rishe thought. It was, of course, the company that had taken her in during her first life.\nThe company had been established just two years prior to picking her up by its owner, a man named Tully. They were still in their growth stage, but in just a few years, they would be the grandest trading company in all the world. They\u2019d proven a great boon in her life as an apothecary as well, helping to distribute her newest medicines. She\u2019d struggled to win their trust initially, but she pledged to work much harder this time around.\nThis marriage isn\u2019t going to happen\u2014I need an escape plan for when it all falls apart. I must bring to bear all my knowledge and influence as a crown princess.\nRishe didn\u2019t know Arnold\u2019s plans, but she had no intention of sitting around and waiting for him to use her as he pleased. She\u2019d spend her time as his consort wisely. Everything must serve her ultimate goal: to live longer than five years, and live well.\nHer fierce determination must have shown on her face because Arnold gave her a little bemused smile. \u201cYes?\u201d\nGod! Rishe grimaced at that flawlessly handsome countenance. Such beauty, possessed by such powerful destruction. The fact that he\u2019d been the man to kill her did nothing to lessen her fascination. In fact, it almost made it worse. The study of contrasts.\n\u201cSorry, I just\u2014\u201d\nShe was interrupted by the horses\u2019 loud whinnies.\n\u201cStop! Hey, stop the coach!\u201d\nShouts drifted back from conveyance ahead of theirs, which contained the luggage and attendants. The squadron of knights tailing the column of coaches sped off toward the front.\n\u201cWho do you think you\u2014graaargh!\u201d\nThat didn\u2019t sound good. Rishe",

He drew his sword.\n\u201cHey!\u201d\nArnold locked the door from the outside. \u201cStay hidden.\u201d\nWhy is he putting himself in danger? That\u2019s what knights are for! The fact that Rishe had been about to do the same thing didn\u2019t occur to her. It\u2019s probably bandits. He told me to stay hidden in here, but I\u2019m not"

    "prefix_text": " relief, Rishe returned to her herbs.\n \n***\n \nAfter the bandit incident, Rishe felt the knights begin to ease a bit in her presence.\nDespite their initial reluctance to accept her help, they continued to report the injured men\u2019s progress and bring any concerns directly to her. In return, they took over gathering herbs from the surrounding countryside on their rest stops.\nShe hadn\u2019t done it for gratitude, but she was nonetheless touched. Gathering medicinal herbs had been second nature ever since her life as an apothecary, and it was foolish to ever turn down loyalty.\nSeveral days after the altercation with the bandits, the coach train finally arrived in the imperial capital of Galkhein.\n\u201cOh my,\u201d Rishe murmured as they passed through the gates.\nWhite stone buildings stood in straight rows, lining clean, orderly streets. The first stories all appeared to be shops, while the second-floor windows were festooned with flowers. Everywhere she looked were smiling faces, citizens turned out to witness their prince\u2019s return over the smooth brick roads. Overlooking it all was the towering magnificence of the imperial palace.\n\u201cThe capital is the seat of power in Galkhein,\u201d Arnold explained. \u201cSeveral key trade routes converge here.\u201d\nRishe nodded, suddenly anxious to be out of the coach. More and more people were gathering to watch their progress, some carrying shopping bags in both arms or holding hands with children. Many of them waved, as if greeting someone dear to them.\nHappy citizens and clean, orderly streets meant wealth. Galkhein was well-off. Rishe couldn\u2019t help but grin at an adorable little girl watching them roll by with sparkling eyes. When she saw Rishe\u2019s smile, she blushed and leapt up in the air, laughing with delight.\nThe coach made its way through the city before passing through the castle gates. Lines of disciplined knights flanked the road, ready to greet the crown prince and his fianc\u00e9e.\nArnold stepped out of the coach, holding out his hand to Rishe. She took it reflexively as she alighted. A prince would be expected to help any lady out of carriage, never mind his own consort, yet for some reason the knights looked a bit disturbed.\nRishe shot them back of look of innocent confusion.\n\u201cOur long journey is at last at its end, Your Highness, Lady Rishe.\u201d Oliver emerged from the ranks of the knights, bowing. He shot Arnold a curious glance. \u201cHow novel to see you taking the hand of your fianc\u00e9e.\u201d\nAh! Rishe realized that she herself had willingly broken the condition that she had imposed. Arnold had offered his hand, but she was the one who accepted.\nArnold gave a little laugh of triumph. Rishe felt a rush of frustration at being tricked. \nOliver stared at them before leaning in to whisper in Arnold\u2019s ear. Arnold let out a breath of annoyance. \n\u201cIs something the matter?\u201d Rishe asked.\n\u201cI sent orders ahead to have a detached wing of the palace prepared for us, but it seems the preparations are behind schedule. I\u2019m sorry, but you\u2019ll need to stay in a guest room in the main palace for a few days.\u201d\n\u201cOh, I don\u2019t mind if the wing isn\u2019t ready,\u201d Rishe said. \u201cWe can head over there now.\u201d\n\u201cIt hasn\u2019t been used in quite a while. It\u2019ll be covered in dust.\u201d\n\u201cI said that I didn\u2019t mind if it was a mess, remember? But there\u2019s no need for you to put yourself out. By all means, stay in the main palace for as long as you need.\u201d Rishe had spent a life as a maid\u2014dust didn\u2019t scare her. \u201cBesides, I\u2019m a hostage, after all.\u201d\n\u201cYou could at least attempt to sound distressed,\u201d Arnold said with the slightest trace of petulance. \nRishe, who had a huge grin spreading over her face and her chest puffed out with pride, didn\u2019t respond.\n \n***\n \nThe detached wing turned out to be just a separate palace in the distant corner of the grounds\u2014a scant four stories tall and, as advertised, absolutely swimming in dust.\nNot so bad, though. Rishe had pictured decay and clutter, but it was mostly just bare. Bare and musty, but not rotten or falling apart.\n\u201cYou can do whatever you want with this place. I\u2019ll be occupied over the next few days, but feel free to use the guest apartments in the main palace if you get tired of choking to death,\u201d Arnold said before he left.\nAccording to Oliver, work had piled up while the prince was away, and it wasn\u2019t just a few things that could be dispensed with over a few days working around the clock.\nEmperor Arnold Hein\u2026 He\u2019s just a crown prince right now, but I still wish I knew what\u2019s going on in his head. For now, I\u2019ll just focus on what I can do. Like make this place livable.\nShe changed into her plainest dress and rolled up her sleeves. The knights who\u2019d remained to serve as her guard kept watch over her as she went from window to window, throwing them all open.\nIn a stroke of luck, the weather was good, and the detached wing was well placed to soak up the sun. The lack of any creature comforts made it look ascetic and drab, but once it was furnished, Rishe had no doubt it would be lovely.\nLeaving the top floors to air out, Rishe found the stairs to the basement. She pushed the heavy wooden doors open, and mice skittered over her feet. The knights yelped as Rishe descended into the darkness.\n\u201cL-Lady Rishe, why are you going down here?\u201d\n\u201cCleaning supplies are usually kept in the basement. See?\u201d\nThe knights followed her gaze to a duster, broom, dustpan, and pile of fresh cloths. She filled a bucket with water and went to work, rolling up a handkerchief to cover her mouth as she swept dust down from high on the walls. Then she swept up all the dust on the floor.\nIt\u2019s always satisfying to tackle a place this filthy.\nShe corralled the dust bunnies until they were piled up like snow in the center of the hall, and then she swept them out the open door. Once the floors were free of debris, she attacked them with the cloth.\n\u201cLady Rishe, is there anything we can do to help?\nRishe was grateful for the knight\u2019s offer, but she shook her head. \u201cYour job is to guard me, not do my housekeeping.\u201d\n\u201cThis is quite the place to clean on your own, detached though it may be,\u201d the knight said hesitantly. \u201cIt\u2019s not too late to move into the guest chambers instead.\u201d\n\u201cThat\u2019s all right. I like the place already.\u201d\nRishe remained steadfast in her refusal for one reason: readying guest chambers was an awful chore. The palace maids would be expected to work overnight to prepare them, even if the guests were only staying a single night. No speck of dust or strand of hair could remain. Certainly no wrinkled sheets. Rishe knew how exhausting and rigorous a maid\u2019s job was, how nerve-racking.\nShe refused to put the poor dears through such an ordeal for just a few days\u2019 stay. From the sound of things, the palace wasn\u2019t equipped with many housemaids. No doubt they already had their hands full.\n\u201cBesides, take a look.\u201d She held out her arms wide, gesturing to her sparkling clean floor. The knights stared at the bright room in admiration. \u201cCleaning a place with your own hands makes living there that much more satisfying, you see.\u201d\nThe knights smiled their awkward but good-natured agreement.\nRishe worked tirelessly, and before long, the chambers where she would spend the night were ready. The knights offered to carry in the bed, which she allowed.\nWhile they brought in furniture, Rishe started cleaning another room. She had run out of clean water, so she quietly slipped out to the well without informing the knights. It wasn\u2019t quite fair to them, but these were the palace grounds. Surely she didn\u2019t need to be chaperoned everywhere.\nBesides, they\u2019re guards in name only. They\u2019re clearly just here to report my movements to Arnold Hein, Rishe reflected as she walked through a courtyard full of flowers, bucket in hand. Iridescent butterflies cavorted playfully around her feet. He doesn\u2019t seem in a hurry to introduce me to the king. Although if I\u2019m just a hostage, that doesn\u2019t surprise me.\nShe hoped she got to meet the current emperor at least once. The future Arnold\u2019s violent conquest only began after he killed the man and made himself emperor, after all.\nI wonder what happened to Arnold Hein after I died in my past life. Did he reign supreme after winning his war? Or did some country manage to put a stop to his conquest? Whatever the case, I absolutely cannot allow him to start a conflict this time. Being the empress of a wartime nation sounds like so much work! The very thought is unacceptable!\nPerhaps they could divorce, but Rishe had a feeling that if Arnold decided to discard her in the middle of a war, she would fail in her mission to make it past the age of twenty. Better to avoid the situation all together.\nWait. When she thought about it, the cause of every single one of Rishe\u2019s deaths was Arnold and his war. I died fighting. I died when Galkhein\u2019s army invaded\u2026\nLooking at her six lives, all of them had ended in more or less the same way.\nRishe found herself crouched on the ground, cradling her head in her hands. Maybe we should get a divorce right now. But it wasn\u2019t in Rishe\u2019s nature to take back her decisions once she\u2019d made them. \nIf I leave, I\u2019ll probably just die in some war-related disaster again. If I can\u2019t live apart from him, I should take this opportunity to learn everything that I can. \nRishe didn\u2019t know the cause of her repeating lives, but there was no guarantee that the loops were infinite. She had to operate under the possibility that this life could be her last. This required some thought, but standing around seething with anxiety wouldn\u2019t help.\nRight now I\u2019ll focus on cleaning. Once the bath is here, I\u2019ll scrub off all the dust and travel exhaustion. And then I can finally relax! \nBrimming with new determination, she stood up and headed for the well. She was forestalled by the sound of jeering giggles. \n\u201cAww, look at the new girl, trying so hard,\u201d said one voice.\n\u201cAll the enthusiasm in the world won\u2019t make a difference,\u201d said another. \u201cWe\u2019re going to be the crown princess\u2019s maids, not you.\u201d\nThe first added, \u201cHey, are you even listening? Stop wasting your time!\u201d\nRishe heard a weak scream, followed by a thump, like a body hitting the ground. She broke into a run, finding a blonde girl sprawled in the dirt, surrounded by four other women.\n\u201cAre you all right?\u201d Rishe hurried over to help the girl up. Her maid\u2019s uniform\u2014a loose navy-blue dress with a white apron\u2014was smeared with mud. The others were dressed identically.\n\u201cWho are you?\u201d one of the girls snapped at Rishe. She had a mop of blazing-red hair. \u201cAnother newbie?\u201d\nAn understandable mistake. Rishe\u2019s dress was simple, free of ornamentation, and her hair was bound back in a ponytail to keep it out of the way. She was dust-streaked, sweaty, and carrying a bucket in her arms.\nTelling them who I am will be more trouble than it\u2019s worth. Her silence only angered the girls more.\n\u201cAre you one of the crown princess\u2019s maids? They\u2019ve been snatching up every new girl. Those pretty hands of yours don\u2019t look like they\u2019ve ever held a broom,\u201d said one of them.\n\u201cUnfortunately for you, we\u2019ve been working here three years, and we\u2019ll be the ones to serve Prince Arnold as the maids of his palace.\u201d\n\u201cCan you stand? Oh, good, it looks like you\u2019re not injured.\u201d Rishe helped the girl up out of the dirt. \n\u201cHey, don\u2019t ignore us!\u201d the redheaded maid shouted. \u201cYou\u2019ve got some nerve. If you want to make it here, you\u2019ll know your place! I doubt the two of you will last a week!\u201d\nRishe didn\u2019t respond, her attention snagging on something else. The redhead was carrying curtains, probably to bring them to the wash. Rishe stared at them so hard the maid began to shift uncomfortably. \u201cWhat\u2019s your problem?\u201d\n\u201cYou should wait to wash those,\u201d Rishe said.\nThe girl glared daggers at her. \u201cExcuse me? Are you telling me it\u2019s too late in the day? You really are an amateur! The light lasts longer in the spring, you know. And it\u2019s hot today. There\u2019ll be plenty of\u2014\u201d \n\u201cIt\u2019s going to rain, is all.\u201d\nThe maids exchanged glances. \u201cHow can you be so sure?\u201d\n\u201cLook at the clouds amassing. The butterflies and the bees are flying low. The moisture in the air will make the drying take longer.\u201d\n\u201cWhat?\u201d\nAnother maid spoke up in a soft voice. \u201cD",
    "query_text": "iana, you were the one who said we should take the initiative to wash the bigger pieces. You said the crown prince would choose us for his household!\u201d\n\u201cStop putting the blame on me!

The weather is going to be fantastic all day. Come on, we\u2019re hauling these over to the wash!\u201d\nThe three girls meekly followed Diana.\nRishe sighed, turning to the blonde girl. \u201cAre you hurt?\u201d\n\u201cNo, I\u2019m fine.\u201d The girl\u2019s gaze darted around nervously. \u201cI\u2019m Elsie.

    "prefix_text": " interwove as she drifted into wakefulness.\nWhen Rishe finally opened her eyes, she grew even more confused.\nLight blue curtains surrounded the bed, thin enough to allow sunlight to pass through. She pulled them aside to find herself in a bare room devoid of furniture and carpet.\nOh, right. She didn\u2019t need to report for morning training, tend to her herb garden, prepare breakfast, or see how the bottles she had brewed overnight were coming along.\nRealizing that, Rishe buried her face in the pillow. \u201cSo soft,\u201d she murmured. \nJudging by the position of the sun, it was about six o\u2019clock in the morning. She was pretty sure she had gone to bed around midnight last night.\nI slept for six whole hours? Rishe couldn\u2019t believe it. Generally, she was used to getting about four hours of sleep. On bad days, at the height of an emergency as a knight or apothecary, she wouldn\u2019t even get that much. \nI\u2019ve got nothing but cleaning on the schedule today. Hostages can sleep in, right? At least a little? Excitement suffused her at the thought, but that was interrupted by a knock on the door.\n\u201cLady Rishe, are you awake? It\u2019s Oliver\u2014Prince Arnold\u2019s attendant.\u201d\nRishe sat up with a start. \u201cI\u2019m awake!\u201d\nOliver continued to speak through the door. \u201cI apologize for bothering you at such an early hour. I\u2019m here with a delivery.\u201d\n\u201cJust a moment!\u201d Rishe slipped out of the bed, dressed quickly, and tugged the bed\u2019s canopy closed. She opened the door to find Oliver standing in the hallway with a polite smile.\nHe apologized again. \u201cThis was the only time I could slip away from His Highness\u2019s office. I\u2019m glad to see that you\u2019re already dressed.\u201d\n\u201cNot at all.\u201d Rishe paused, stepping back to allow him inside. \u201cOh my. You look exhausted.\u201d\nOliver grimaced. \u201cIs it that obvious? We\u2019ve been climbing through mountains of paperwork, but never mind me. His Highness has been working around the clock.\u201d\nRishe thought back to yesterday, how he had come all the way out to the balcony. He should have used that spare time to sleep. \u201cHe\u2019s in high demand, isn\u2019t he? He was even working on the trip over.\u201d\n\u201cHe finished all the work he brought along with us,\u201d Oliver confirmed. \u201cNow he\u2019s dealing with everything that piled up during his visit to Hermity.\u201d\n\u201cOh.\u201d Rishe grimaced in sympathy. He may have killed her in a past life, but she wouldn\u2019t wish the bureaucracy of kingship on anyone. \u201cIt\u2019s a shame he had to put his work on hold to attend a silly engagement party.\u201d\n\u201cNo matter. That party was how a committed bachelor finally found a bride.\u201d\nHis smile was sincere, but Rishe knew better. She spread her arms. \u201cGo on. Shall I spin around so you have a better view?\u201d\nOliver blinked. \u201cI beg your pardon?\u201d\n\u201cYou\u2019re looking me over like I\u2019m a horse for sale. If there\u2019s anything I can help you with, please let me know.\u201d\nOliver\u2019s brows went up. He let out a little breath of resignation. \u201cHis Highness was right. You do possess the keen perception of a knight. Of course, I\u2019m purely an amateur myself.\u201d\nI\u2019d say this was a merchant\u2019s sixth sense, rather than battle intuition.\nThis wasn\u2019t the first time Rishe had caught Oliver looking at her. It reminded her of the way her noble customers would examine a product, assessing worth and authenticity. Or a merchant weeding out potential merchandise from a wide array of choices.\nIn other words, he was appraising her.\nOliver moved into a deep, sweeping bow. \u201cMy sincerest apologies, my lady. I have been unaccountably rude to my lord\u2019s consort. My behavior was unacceptable.\u201d\nRishe shook her head. \u201cPlease don\u2019t, it\u2019s fine.\u201d It wasn\u2019t unreasonable for the prince\u2019s closest attendant to be wary of strangers. But it did make her curious. \u201cHow long have you worked for Arnold? Have you always been a valet?\u201d\n\u201cI trained as a squire, actually,\u201d Oliver replied. \u201cBut I was injured and dismissed from the order. His Highness took me into his household soon after. I have served him for nearly a decade.\u201d\n\u201cThen maybe you can answer this,\u201d Rishe said. \u201cWhy is Prince Arnold so very intent on making me his wife?\u201d\nOliver hesitated, as if weighing the pros and cons of speaking, \u201cTo be quite honest, I was as surprised as you were. He\u2019s always insisted he had no interest in marriage. But the sight of you in Hermity has changed his mind. Apparently.\u201d\nSo not even his attendant understood his motives. Rishe remained at a complete loss.\n\u201cIf I may, however?\u201d Oliver mistook Rishe\u2019s confusion for anxiety and added, \u201cI have served Prince Arnold for a long time, and never before have I seen him so happy. When he is with you, he laughs. His smiles are sincere.\u201d\nRishe was taken aback. She\u2019d figured all of Arnold\u2019s laughter and teasing was at her expense. His own private jokes.\n\u201cAre you\u2026unhappy with him?\u201d Oliver ventured. \u201cWith his looks, His Highness is exceedingly popular with the ladies of the court, you know.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m sure he has many admirers.\u201d She paused. \u201cWould you really call the way he acts around me \u2018happy\u2019? To me, it seems more like a cat with a mouse.\u201d\nOliver laughed. He didn\u2019t deny it. \u201cI am pleased you understand His Highness so well. Oh, I nearly forgot. Here.\u201d\nHe held out a sheaf of three documents. \u201cThis is the guest list for your wedding. His Highness bids you look over it.\u201d\n\u201cThank you,\u201d Rishe said, pleasantly surprised. She hadn\u2019t even needed to ask. She gave it a quick glance, quickly identifying the most prominent and powerful names.\nKing Zahad, Prince Kyle, Princess Harriet. And from the Kingdom of Domana, we have Lord Jonal attending as the representative of the king. No surprise there.\nMore than a wedding guest register, this was a list of key people from the countries Arnold would go on to antagonize. Even before the murder of the king and the start of the war, there must have been a trigger\u2014a sea change in the affairs of state. Everyone on this list was most likely involved.\nKing Zahad. I hope we can be friends again like in my first life. Hmm\u2026 Prince Kyle is rather frail. I hope he isn\u2019t working himself too hard. He has a strong sense of responsibility\u2014he\u2019ll attend the wedding even though it\u2019ll be a long trip.\nThe sight of these names filled Rishe with a longing for those lives, for the people she\u2019d once known. And sometime in the very near future, they would all be Galkhein\u2019s enemies.\nIf I take matters into my own hands, perhaps I can salvage some of these relationships before they sour. Even if we aren\u2019t allies, we don\u2019t have to be enemies. Anything to stave off the outbreak of war.\nOliver had no idea what was going through Rishe\u2019s head. Brightly, he continued their conversation. \u201cThe ceremony will be held in three months\u2019 time. All preparations must be complete by then. And now\u2026we need to discuss tonight\u2019s party.\u201d\n\u201cTonight\u2019s what?\u201d\nOliver stiffened. \u201cDid His Highness not tell you?\u201d\n\u201cNo, he most certainly did not! There\u2019s to be a party?\u201d\n\u201cUgh, not again!\u201d Oliver dug his knuckles into his forehead.\nRishe put two and two together. She hesitated, then said, \u201cSo there is one, then. As you must know, His Highness is trying to stamp it down without telling me.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d Oliver replied. \u201cHe should have mentioned it to you. You don\u2019t need to attend, but he will. At least, I hope he will. I think I managed to convince him.\u201d\nShe sympathized with Oliver. Under normal circumstances, it would be unheard of for the crown prince and his fianc\u00e9e to fail to appear at a banquet. \u201cDon\u2019t worry, Oliver. I\u2019ll go.\u201d\nOliver let out a sigh of relief. \u201cReally? Thank you so much, my lady. I\u2019ll put finding you a maid at the top of my to-do list.\u201d\n\u201cNo need.\u201d Rishe smiled. \u201cI can prepare for the party on my own.\u201d\nThis maid-selection process made Rishe uneasy. After witnessing that exchange between the servants in the garden, she imagined quarrels breaking out all through the palace. And she doubted the disputes would go away even after they decided.\nOliver frowned. \u201cBut won\u2019t dressing be difficult without a lady\u2019s maid?\u201d \nShe shook her head. \u201cI can do my hair and put on a gown by myself. I brought dresses and cosmetics from home. Don\u2019t worry.\u201d\nRishe ignored Oliver\u2019s stunned look, already reevaluating her cleaning plans.\n \n***\n \nThe first thing Rishe said to Arnold that night was, \u201cYour Highness, I have a request.\u201d Her gown rustled as she leaned in close. \u201cI would like some herb seed and a corner of the gardens. I made a list. I hope we can discuss this in more detail later.\u201d\nArnold was silent a moment. \u201cRishe.\u201d\n\u201cWhat? Didn\u2019t you tell me to let you know if there was anything I wanted?\u201d She looked at him quizzically, and Arnold sighed.\nShe\u2019d heard that he\u2019d finished his mountain of work and even managed to sleep for a while. He was dressed in his usual military black, trimmed with a red mantle and black gloves.\nArnold shook his head. \u201cThat\u2019s not what I mean. I\u2019m guessing that Oliver didn\u2019t tell you the reason for this party? It\u2019s merely for appearance\u2019s sake. I need to look like I\u2019m searching for a bride within our borders as well. There\u2019s no reason for you to attend.\u201d\nIt made sense. The crown prince\u2014the greatest catch in the kingdom\u2014marrying a foreigner without even the slightest nod to propriety would invite unwanted discontent from the nobility.\n\u201cHowever, we\u2019re betrothed,\u201d Arnold said. \u201cThis whole evening is merely a formality. And with news that you\u2019re my \u2018hostage\u2019 going around, you\u2019ll be an object of curiosity. I don\u2019t want to put you through that.\u201d\n\u201cWell, I already went to the trouble of getting ready.\u201d Rishe plucked at her soft blue dress, draped in fluttering layers around her like a flower bud. She\u2019d braided her hair, decorating it with accessories. Her makeup was light, her shoes polished to a mirror shine. Her only jewelry was a pair of pearl earrings.\n\u201cRishe\u2026\u201d\n\u201cYour Highness, the court may consider my status as a captive princess shameful in the extreme, but I don\u2019t.\u201d She\u2019d chosen this course, after all.\nArnold was again watching her with a mixture of wonder and confusion.\n\u201cSo don\u2019t worry,\u201d she said, extending her hand. \u201cFeel free to show off your fianc\u00e9e.\u201d\nArnold relented, his dashing smile creeping out once again. \u201cVery well. I should take advantage of this opportunity to touch my betrothed.\u201d\n\u201cWe\u2019re wearing gloves.\u201d\nArnold took Rishe\u2019s hand.\nA throng of guests was gathered in the ballroom as a group of musicians performed on a platform. Women in gowns stood clustered, while gentlemen in military attire grouped together. A mere glance was enough to tell their clothes were of the highest quality. They mingled happily, making small talk with glasses in hand.\nRishe let her hand rest on Arnold\u2019s arm as she paused at the threshold to take it all in. \u201cThis is a bigger event than I was expecting.\u201d\n\u201cIs it? I\u2019d say it\u2019s a rather small gathering, actually.\u201d\n\u201cMaybe for a military powerhouse,\u201d Rishe muttered. \nYet another reminder of Galkhein\u2019s wealth took her off guard. Arnold just looked bored.\n\u201cThe size doesn\u2019t matter,\u201d he said. \u201cIn the end, they\u2019re only here for gossip. Look, here they come.\u201d\nIn the blink of an eye, they were surrounded by guests.\n\u201cPrince Arnold, thank you for gracing us with an invitation,\u201d said one man. \u201cSuch a pleasure.\u201d \n\u201cThe pleasure is mine, Lord Abel",
    "query_text": ",\u201d Arnold drawled.\n\u201cYour Highness! We were so glad to hear of your safe return,\u201d another guest chirped. \u201cPlease, our daughter is simply dying to be regaled with tales of your trip.\u201d\n\u201cI can\u2019t imagine I\u2019d have anything particularly exciting to share with her,\u201d Arnold said curtly.\nAfter the last"

    "prefix_text": " need information. Galkhein\u2019s political landscape was a mystery to me through all my past lives. I only know the rumors that made it abroad.\nAlthough she knew of Arnold\u2019s eventual patricide, she had no concept of the circumstances leading up to it. She needed a better picture of the factions and power balance inside the court. The lives these people led.\nI know better than to believe wartime gossip. This Arnold Hein is a lot different from what I\u2019d heard he was like at nineteen. He\u2019s not as diabolical as the rumors led me to believe. He likes to push, but he isn\u2019t unkind. The thought drifted across her mind, leaving her conflicted. Well, he\u2019s not unkind now. But I still don\u2019t like not knowing his motives. And he\u2019s a bit of a jerk, to be honest. \nShe tried to settle her mind and just observe. Gathering intelligence was necessary to lead a long, carefree life lazing around the palace.\nIf I recall correctly, that\u2019s Lord Hannawald. He seems to be on good terms with Count Gayle. Duke Hudemann and Duke Teinitz are having a friendly enough conversation, yet they don\u2019t seem close. Rishe ticked off the names of people she\u2019d met, committing them to memory.\nA wave of sweet perfume wafted over her. A pretty girl with soft blonde hair had appeared at her side. \u201cHow do you do, Lady Rishe? I\u2019m Cornelia Thea Toona.\u201d\nDuke Toona\u2019s family was the thirty-first house she\u2019d met tonight.\nRishe smiled graciously. \u201cRishe Irmgard Weitzner. A pleasure to meet you.\u201d\n\u201cThe pleasure is all mine.\u201d Cornelia smiled sweetly. Her eyes were big and bright, her lips full. She held a glass in each hand and offered one to Rishe. \u201cWine? I see you\u2019re empty-handed.\u201d\nA gaggle of other ladies nearby began giggling among themselves.\n\u201cHow dare she act so haughty when she\u2019s a captive. It\u2019s time for her learn just what she is. A pawn to be played and discarded.\u201d\n\u201cShe should enjoy her time on Prince Arnold\u2019s arm while she can.\u201d\n\u201cShe is from a minor nation, after all.\u201d\nAs Rishe took note of their whispers, Cornelia gazed at her with doe eyes. \u201cDoes my offering offend you in some way?\u201d\nIf I remember correctly, House Toona holds a vast territory in southern Galkhein.\nRishe held out a hand to accept the glass. \u201cHow could it? Thank you, Lady Cornelia.\u201d\nBefore Rishe could touch the glass, Cornelia gave a dramatic shout. \u201cOh dear! My hand slipped!\u201d She dropped it, quite obviously on purpose. Without thinking, Rishe grabbed her skirts and leaned back, plucking the glass out of the air with the other hand.\nCornelia let out a cry of surprise as Rishe caught the wine before any could spill. She swirled the glass and brought it to her nose to breathe in the bouquet.\nHmm\u2026 That\u2019s mashed capsicum. Where did she even get that? What a waste of perfectly good wine. And why bother spicing it enough to singe the tongue if she just planned to ruin my dress? Pick a plan, my dear.\nHiding her exasperation, Rishe smiled brightly. \u201cI\u2019ve never had a wine quite like this. What an unusual scent.\u201d\nCornelia bit her lip in frustration. Rishe beamed at her. You\u2019ve got such a pretty face, Lady Toona. Why don\u2019t you smile?\nRishe leaned in close to Cornelia. \u201cThis vintage isn\u2019t available where I\u2019m from. I\u2019m ever so anxious to learn more. Should I perhaps invite Prince Arnold over to enjoy a glass? Which tray did you get this from?\u201d\n\u201cWhat? Oh, um\u2026\u201d Rishe had a policy of never backing down from a fight, but it seemed Cornelia didn\u2019t share it. \u201cS-sorry, but I don\u2019t remember. Such a large hall, you see.\u201d\n\u201cA shame. I\u2019ll just give His Highness this one, then. I\u2019ll be sure to let him know who it\u2019s from.\u201d\n\u201cUh, wait!\u201d Cornelia rapidly shook her head. \u201cI-I got that glass for you, so I think you should\u2014you know what? Never mind! Maybe I should just take that\u2014oh no!\u201d\nRishe ignored the ashen-faced Cornelia, raising the glass and swallowing down a gulp. \n\u201cI-I can\u2019t believe\u2026\u201d\n\u201cSuch a spicy flavor, just as I imagined.\u201d Rishe smiled again to the assembled group\u2019s astonishment. \u201cWhat a warm welcome. I do hope the two of us can spend more time together. Perhaps\u2026a tea party?\u201d\n\u201cTh-the two of us?\u201d Cornelia stammered.\n\u201cYes. I want to know all about House Toona.\u201d\nCornelia looked flabbergasted, but she recovered herself and nodded.\nThat should do. One of Rishe\u2019s eventual plans required a plot of land in a temperate climate. House Toona\u2019s would likely be perfect, but she needed to confirm a few things with Cornelia. Never back down from a fight. Even further\u2026\nShe recalled the words of her mentor from her days as a merchant.\nDon\u2019t bother with fights you can\u2019t win.\nThe other ladies fled, fearful of this strange girl who gulped down painfully spicy wine like it was nothing. \n \n***\n \nRishe retreated to the empty balcony to enjoy the music, grimacing with every stinging mouthful of wine. She drank it in decreasing sips until Arnold joined her.\n\u201cWhat are you making that face for?\u201d\nRishe swirled the glass. \u201cDon\u2019t worry, it\u2019s not you. It\u2019s just this wine is so spicy.\u201d\n\u201cSpicy? The wine is?\u201d\n\u201cMm. It\u2019s seasoned with capsicum. I barely managed to get that first mouthful down without gagging.\u201d\nArnold swiped the glass from her hand. \u201cDon\u2019t tell me this was a poisoning attempt!\u201d\nRishe clicked her tongue in annoyance at her own lack of vigilance. No one else would be able to grab something from her so easily.\nArnold glared at the wine. \u201cYou don\u2019t need to drink this. I\u2019ll get rid of it.\u201d\n\u201cHey, give that back! They ruined a perfectly good glass of wine because of me. I\u2019m not going to waste it.\u201d She grabbed it back and took another sip, shuddering at the taste.\nArnold glowered. \u201cTell me who did this. I\u2019ll have them executed.\u201d\n\u201cDon\u2019t be ridiculous. You don\u2019t kill people like her\u2014you use them.\u201d Just the tiniest bit of wine to go, but it was getting harder to make herself drink it. She gave the glass a reproachful look, then glanced back at Arnold. \u201cOh, and I owe you an apology.\u201d\n\u201cDo you?\u201d\n\u201cI used your name to defend myself.\u201d The girls had only backed off when she threatened to tattle to Arnold. Rishe found that sort of thing inelegant in the extreme, and she was embarrassed.\nArnold sighed at Rishe\u2019s apologetic bow. \u201cThere\u2019s nothing wrong with a wife invoking her husband\u2019s name.\u201d\nRishe hesitated. \u201cWe\u2019re not married yet.\u201d\n\u201cThat\u2019s a formality. It\u2019s as good as done, if you ask me.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2026see.\u201d\nHe took her distraction as an opportunity to swipe her glass back. Instead of dumping it out, Arnold gulped the rest of it down. \n\u201cDamn, that packs a punch,\u201d he grumbled.\n\u201cI told you that!\u201d Rishe snapped. \u201cAre you all right? Let me get you some water!\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m fine. But now you\u2019ve fulfilled your obligation to the wine, haven\u2019t you?\u201d\nRishe didn\u2019t know what to say. He\u2019d helped her\u2014not by taking charge but by following her lead. Without cutting her down and telling her she was being foolish. Without rolling his eyes and dismissing her desires as trifles.\n\u201cThank you,\u201d Rishe said stiffly, which just made him laugh.\n\u201cWhat were you thinking about when we were dancing?\u201d he asked.\n\u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d\n\u201cYou were thinking about someone else, weren\u2019t you? Who?\u201d\nRishe didn\u2019t know a delicate way to say I was thinking about a future version of you I met in another life.\n\u201cHmm?\u201d His tone was oddly light, teasing even. But the gleam in his hunter\u2019s eyes said she wouldn\u2019t get away so easily.\nObviously, Rishe couldn\u2019t give him an honest answer. \u201cI wasn\u2019t thinking about anyone else. I was worried about you.\u201d\n\u201cWhy?\u201d\nThis was the closest she could come to the truth. \u201cWere you injured here?\u201d She patted her own left shoulder with her forefinger. \nArnold went silent. His left shoulder was slightly slower to react than his right\u2014if his right was at one hundred, then his left was at maybe ninety-eight. It was hardly noticeable, but Rishe had picked up on it. He was right-handed, and she wouldn\u2019t have noticed it if they\u2019d been dancing normally. \nThat, and if it hadn\u2019t been for memories from her past life.\nRishe had only managed to inflict a single injury on him. An instant, a moment\u2019s hesitation where she saw her chance and slashed left. Of course, he\u2019d shrugged off the injury and effortlessly run her through. \n\u201cHeh.\u201d Arnold finally broke his silence with grim laughter. His eyes sent shivers down her spine, cold and bewitching. In lieu of an answer, he reached for his collar, unfastening the clasp with a snap and drawing his jacket open with a rough tug.\nOh my.\nRishe drew in a breath. A great scar was engraved into the nape of his neck, just low enough to be concealed by clothing. It looked several years old. \u201cIt\u2019s an old wound. It continues to the top of my shoulder and pulls the skin taut.\u201d\n\u201cHow awful.\u201d Rishe couldn\u2019t help but reach out to gingerly touch the nape of his neck.\nArnold accepted her touch without a word. She\u2019d half expected to be slapped aside.\nHer fingers slowly traced the shape of it. She could feel the rough skin through her gloves.\nHe must have gotten this over a decade ago. Someone stabbed him\u2014and not just once or twice. They must have done it over and over to make this scar pattern.\nHer medical training had her shuddering at the image of a nine-year-old Arnold ashen and trembling with blood loss. The fact that he\u2019d survived and retained the use of his arm was incredible. And then to go on to wield a sword so skillfully\u2014his suffering must have been immense.\n\u201cOnly a few people know about this injury. You\u2019re the first to notice on your own.\u201d\n\u201cHow did it happen?\u201d\nThat grim smile returned as he looked down at Rishe. With the moon hanging behind him, he was as opaque as ever, but Rishe understood the sentiment.\nI shouldn\u2019t pry.\nRishe pulled her hand away, and that ominous smile that sent chills down her spine disappeared. Arnold put his jacket back in order, reclasping it at the neck.\nSomeone tried to kill Arnold Hein about ten years ago. But who and why? Rishe cast her eyes down as she ruminated. The most obvious beneficiaries of a dead crown prince would be potential heirs and those loyal to them. I believe Arnold has a younger brother, but I haven\u2019t met him yet.\nOdd. Rishe might be a hostage, but shouldn\u2019t she meet her future relatives? Perhaps it was Arnold\u2019s doing and not the will of the imperial family themselves. He didn\u2019t seem to want to involve her in anything unless it was absolutely necessary\u2014he hadn\u2019t told her about this ball, after all. \nRishe looked up at him. \u201cYour Highness, may I select my maids some time over the next few days?\u201d \n\u201cVery well. I\u2019ll tell Oliver to make that a priority.\u201d\n\u201cAh, I can do the selection myself. We needn\u2019t trouble him.\u201d\nArnold arched an amused brow. Gone was that unsettling smile, replaced with his easy manner. \u201cWhat are you planning this time?\u201d\n\u201cOh, nothing important,\u201d Rishe said. She picked up her empty glass. \u201cI\u2019m merely concerned about the servants\u2019 working conditions.\u201d\nTo protect her life and well-being, she needed to keep from dying at twenty years old again. And to do that, she had to prevent Arnold Hein\u2019s war. Her best bet would be to appeal to the important people she\u2019d known in her past lives. People with influence.\nPlus, there was a mountain of things she needed to do in preparation for the marriage ceremony.\nI need to sow a plot of land, grow herbs, do lots of shopping, get cheap alcohol, and then\u2026 \nRishe began a to-do list that had nothing to do with war in the least.\n \n***\n \nAs the ball wound to a close, a lone boy stood in the gloomy courtyard of the imperial palace. He had soft black hair and round blue eyes. No older than sixteen, he had an androgynous grace to him, gaze fixed on the balcony above. \nHe was watching a girl.\nShe had coral-colored hair, and even from this distance, he could tell she was beautiful. She stood there alone, apparently waiting for someone. Whoever it was must have shown up because her hand slipped from the banister, and she stepped away. Not too long after, a man appeared where she had been standing.\nThe man turned a silent glare down into the garden, as if he\u2019d known the boy had been there the whole time, despite the shadows.\nA shiver ran down the boy\u2019s spine and he smiled reflexively, delighting in the intense aura of threat the man gave off. It was just a warning, it seemed, as the man abruptly turned on his heel and disappeared. \n\u201cAww, we can\u2019t play together either?\u201d The boy hung his head. \u201cI miss you, Brother.\u201d\nIt had to be the woman. The beauty. She\u2019d made the boy\u2019s life hell since the day she arrived. \nHis brother had prohibited him from attending balls like this one. That was fine; he\u2019d sooner avoid them altogether. Still, he\u2019d wanted to meet that girl. \n\u201cBut we\u2019ll meet soon enough, won\u2019t we?\u201d He spoke to himself in a soft voice. \u201cI\u2019ve got plans for you, Sister.\u201d \n\n(2) chapter number given is likely out of range: 0\nChapter: 8\n\nChapter 3\nChapter 3\n \n\u201cYOU\u2019RE ALL SO USELESS!\u201d Diana the redheaded maid\u2019s voice rang out inside the stone washhouse. \nThree days had passed since the afternoon Rishe shook off her guard and came out to the well. Rishe was once again dressed to fit in with the maids. At Diana\u2019s shout, she looked up without pausing in her work. \n\u201cIs even laundry beyond your capabilities? I asked you to wash these this morning, and now it\u2019s past noon! Meanwhile, we\u2019ve finished cleaning the entire first floor in a third of the time!\u201d\n\u201cI-I\u2019m sorry, Diana.\u201d\nThe new maids went silent with shame. Among them was Elsie, the girl Rishe stood up for the other day. Rishe pulled her hands out of the soapy water, gently rinsed them, and said, \u201cLet me help. What still needs to be done?\u201d\n\u201cYou again?\u201d Diana rounded on Rishe. \u201cI don\u2019t know who you serve, but I\u2019m amazed you have the time to do other people\u2019s work. I wish I had so much free time.\u201d\nHuffily, she turned from Rishe. \u201cLet\u2019s just ignore these useless fools. Laura, Maya. Come on. If we want to be chosen as Lady Rishe\u2019s maids, we mustn\u2019t waste our time.\u201d\nDiana took out a slip of paper from her pocket, smoothing it out. \u201cIt looks like the new bedsheets for her palace will arrive today. We should inspect them to make sure everything is perfect!\u201d\n\u201cWait up, Diana!\u201d\nThe two maids followed Diana out. Rishe waited for the door to close before turning to Elsie and the others. \u201cLet\u2019s keep working. If there\u2019s anything too large and cumbersome, feel free to pass it over to me.\u201d\n\u201cTh-thank you so much!\u201d The new maids went weak with gratitude. One of them, a girl on the verge of tears, even fell into a full bow. Rishe muttered encouragement as she scrubbed some bedsheets.\nElsie, who was",
    "query_text": " washing the sheets with her, wore a rueful look. \u201cI\u2019m so sorry for the trouble. We\u2019re just not learning fast enough.\u201d\n\u201cYou haven\u2019t been working here long, have you? It takes time to learn a new job, no matter who you are,\u201d Rishe said as she kept scrub"

    "prefix_text": " palace will be the perfect place to learn.\u201d\nThe new recruits were completely speechless, unsure of exactly what was happening. \nRishe smiled at Elsie. \u201cI hope you\u2019ll serve me well, Elsie.\u201d\nElsie was still frozen in place. \u201cHuh? Y-yes, my lady, but\u2014\u201d\nA shaking Diana cried out, \u201cBut why, my lady?! You\u2019ve seen their work! They\u2019re useless, the lot of them! The rest of us get so much more done in a shorter amount of time!\u201d\n\u201cWatch your tongue, girl,\u201d Oliver said sharply.\nDiana ignored him. \u201cWe\u2019re hard workers! Any job you assign us, we can do it! Please, I beg you, my lady!\u201d\n\u201cStep back,\u201d Oliver warned. \u201cDo not take a single step closer to Lady Rishe.\u201d\nDiana spoke in a rush, words pouring out of her. \u201cI-I freely admit that I was impolite before, but I didn\u2019t know who she was! I\u2019ll take any punishment, so please, give me the chance to show you how well I can work!\u201d\nRishe said, \u201cDiana, I have a request.\u201d\n\u201cTh-thank you, my lady!\u201d Diana heaved a sigh of relief. \u201cYou mean you\u2019ll\u2014\u201d \nRishe cut across her. \u201cAs of today, you are no longer a maid in this palace.\u201d \n\u201cWhat?\u201d Her face, usually so fixed with determination, paled. \u201cBut why? I\u2019m so much better than any of them! I\u2019ll do a perfect job no matter what task you set before me. Please don\u2019t dismiss me, my lady!\u201d \n\u201cListen to me, Diana.\u201d Rishe dropped her lofty tone, speaking as one woman would to another. \u201cYou have noticed it, haven\u2019t you? No matter what you claim, these new girls aren\u2019t worthless.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2026I don\u2019t understand.\u201d\n\u201cCan you remember your first month in service? How difficult it was?\u201d\nDiana looked completely bewildered. Her gaze darted around as if looking for help.\nPulling herself together, she forced herself to follow Rishe\u2019s directions. She thought back and finally alighted on a response. \u201cI\u2026I didn\u2019t know how to do the job. Before, when my family was still prominent, I\u2019d washed shirts and bedsheets. Never gowns or military uniforms.\u201d\n\u201cPerfectly reasonable,\u201d Rishe said. \u201cOnly natural for someone just starting out.\u201d\n\u201cThe older girls were so busy, they told me to just watch them since they didn\u2019t have time to teach me. When I had questions\u2026well, there was nobody to ask.\u201d\n\u201cI bet. And did you have any other problems?\u201d\n\u201cWell, yes. There was a lot to learn. Different kinds of soap and washboards depending on the cloth. You use different tools for different materials. I had to learn how they worked and how to put them away. I was\u2026punished if I didn\u2019t get it right the first time.\u201d\nThe newcomers were exchanging surprised looks. Rishe understood why.\nEverything Diana said was familiar to them. They spent valuable time searching for their materials and the proper ways to use them, but they shrank from asking for help. Everyone always looked so busy. This was a universal problem.\n\u201cDespite all that, I got better!\u201d Diana protested. \u201cI only needed to be taught once. Unlike them! They\u2019re useless!\u201d\n\u201cYes, well. There\u2019s a difference between you and them,\u201d Rishe told Diana. \u201cYou can read and write.\u201d\n\u201cOh!\u201d Diana started in surprise. Elsie looked at the floor.\nThe literacy rate among commoners was low no matter where you went. Very few families had the means to afford an education, especially for daughters. Diana had been born to a merchant\u2019s family\u2014she\u2019d received formal schooling. The maids she was close friends with were likely from similar backgrounds. The majority of those in service were not so fortunate.\n\u201cWhat if you only received instructions on how to do a job once and weren\u2019t able to write it down to remind yourself later?\u201d Rishe asked. \u201cWould you be so confident?\u201d\n\u201cI-I don\u2019t\u2014\u201d Diana reflexively thrust a hand into her apron pocket, where she had a list of daily tasks recorded in her neat handwriting to reference throughout the day. Hopefully now she would understand how much of an edge her privileged literacy gave her over the other maids.\n\u201cEveryone else works as hard as they can, just like you do,\u201d Rishe said. \u201cRemember how it was for you at first? They all have to start somewhere. I hope you\u2019ll keep that in mind.\u201d\n\u201cThey\u2019re no different from me,\u201d Diana mumbled begrudgingly, glancing around the room, looking at the less experienced maids. As if coming to a decision, she said, \u201cI\u2019m sorry.\u201d\n\u201cDiana?\u201d\nLike a child enumerating her regrets, Diana went on, \u201cI\u2019ve done you wrong, all of you. It\u2019s just, I had nothing. Or so it felt like. No money, no title. I thought I had to make my way in the world on my own. That I had to start from zero.\u201d Her shoulders trembled as she buried her face in her hands. \u201cBut I was wrong! I wasn\u2019t starting from zero. I had everything that I learned growing up. I didn\u2019t realize how fortunate I was. I let it all go to my he\n \n\u201cRISHE IRMGARD WEITZNER! You are a vile woman! A truly malicious creature unworthy of the crown prince! As of this instant, our engagement is off!\u201d \n\u201cAs you wish, Your Highness.\u201d\n\u201c\u2026Huh?\u201d\nThe prince\u2019s declaration echoed throughout the ballroom. Rishe, the duke\u2019s daughter, bowed in response, her coral-toned hair swaying gracefully. The assembled guests found themselves captivated by her dignified beauty. Despite having just witnessed a broken engagement, they couldn\u2019t bring themselves to pity her.\nSlowly, Rishe lifted her head and fixed the prince with a pale-emerald gaze. It caught him off guard, but he quickly recovered.\n\u201cDidn\u2019t you hear what I just said?! I\u2019m calling off our engagement! Doesn\u2019t that trouble you?\u201d\n\u201cNot really.\u201d\nRishe already knew what happened next: false accusations, exile, and her family severing all ties and leaving her to survive on her own. She turned from the prince. There was no point wasting any time.\nThis is my seventh loop, after all.\nRishe had done this all before.\nThe next few hours will be busy. I must hurry and retrieve my things before I\u2019m barred from the family estate. I don\u2019t want this to be one of the times I\u2019m too slow and I have to start my new life with nothing.\n\u201cRishe, halt and hear me! I have spent the past week perfecting my recitation of your crimes!\u201d\nI should take more than dresses this time\u2014there\u2019s plenty of things I could use out in the world. What trade should I take up? In my first life, I was a merchant. In my second, an apothecary. I\u2019ve got a few more I want to try out\u2026 Augh! If time\u2019s just going to keep resetting, I wish I could start at an earlier point. I need more time to prepare!\n\u201cWait! Rishe!\u201d\nThe crown prince was on the verge of tears, and the spectators struggled to suppress their snickers. \nA thought occurred to Rishe, and she stopped. She then turned, her eyes gleaming beneath long lashes as she stared down her ex-fianc\u00e9. \u201cAh, Your Highness, I almost forgot.\u201d \n\u201cYes, tell me!\u201d the prince fumed. \u201cLet me guess, you are hurt beyond measure and yet love me still\u2026correct?\u201d\nAs if. Rishe was grateful to be granted her freedom. In fact, she was smiling as she said, \u201cI hope you and Lady Mary are happy together.\u201d\n\u201cWhat?!\u201d\n\u201cMay we both lead fulfilling lives. Farewell!\u201d Rishe lifted the skirts of her evening gown and turned on her heel, departing as briskly as she could.\n\u201cHow do you know about Mary? I haven\u2019t told you I love her!\u201d The prince was shouting something behind her, but she paid him no mind. She had things to do.\nDuring her first loop, the prince\u2019s accusations had shocked her to the core and she\u2014foolishly so\u2014had attempted to defend herself. Now she knew better than to expect the prince to behave reasonably. \nHow will life unfold this time? I\u2019m excited to find out! Rishe fixed her mind on the future.\nThis is my seventh \u201cdo-over.\u201d I\u2019ve led happy and carefree lives before, but this time\u2014this time, I swear I\u2019ll live a long happy and carefree life!\nIn other words, she needed to avoid getting killed. At any cost. \n \n***\n \nIn the first loop, with her engagement broken and her reputation in tatters, Rishe roamed with nothing but the clothes on jewelry. Finding them a good-natured band, she hitched a ride to a neighboring country.\nFrom the merchant caravan, she learned a trade, studying how to procure stock and balance ledgers. Eventually, she set out on her own to travel the world. Her upbringing as a daughter of the nobility meant that, even at fifteen years old, Rishe possessed a keen sense for beauty.\nShe collected things that caught her eye and sold them to whoever found delight in her wares. Before she realized it, she had become a major vendor, employing a full staff. She had even done business with the king of a desert nation and the prince of a frozen country up north. She traveled to many distant places, realizing a dream born from her cossetted former life spent doing nothing but preparing to be queen.\nFive years passed, and just as she had only one country left to visit, Rishe fell victim to the war sweeping across the continent.\nThe next thing she knew, she was fifteen years old again and back at that party, with the prince poised to make his pronouncement.\n\u201cRishe Irmgard Weitzner! You are a vile woman! A truly malicious creature unworthy of the crown prince! As of this instant, our engagement is off!\u201d\nNaturally, she didn\u2019t understand what was going on at first. She looked around. Everything was the same. She stood in the same place wearing the same dress and draped in the same jewelry she\u2019d sold to the caravan.\nWas it a dream? Or was everything that had happened up until then the dream? In her confusion, all she could do was stare.\nRishe hurried out of the ballroom, the impending threat of exile hanging over her and the prince\u2019s entreaties to halt ringing in her ears.\nThis is perfect! Now I can get it right! I\u2019ll grab everything valuable from my room.\nRishe had enjoyed her life as a merchant, but she had always felt a stirring of regret about this night. If only she\u2019d brought some funds from home, she would\u2019ve had the capital to establish her business much sooner!\nSpeaking of this regret always prompted disbelief from her customers, including the king of the desert. \u201cWhat? That\u2019s what you\u2019d want to do over?!\u201d\nWhen she arrived back at home on the night of her second life, Rishe grabbed her jewelry box and as many of the books her late grandmother had left her as she could carry, then made haste to the forest to meet the caravan. But the stop at her house took time, and she missed them completely.\nIn that moment, Rishe made a stark realization. Different choices meant different mistakes. Opening one door would close another.\nAnd so the easy path to a life in commerce was closed to her.\nSure, she could try to build her business from the ground up, but personal connections were almost as essential to being a merchant as business savvy. It just wasn\u2019t realistic without a single acquaintance. \nSorting through her belongings in resignation, she came across a foreign encyclopedia of herbs among her grandmother\u2019s books. Taking it as a sign, Rishe sold her jewels elsewhere and used the funds to cross the sea and pursue the study of medicine.\nFortunately, Rishe retained all her knowledge from her previous life. She remembered that certain expensive herbs could be acquired cheaply in other regions. When word spread of a disease running rampant in a neighboring country, she recalled that too. This foreknowledge proved invaluable, as did her wide travel and exposure to many different teachers with many different points of view.\nAs such, Rishe led a successful life as an apothecary. She saved a feeble prince, synthesized a number of rare medicines with her mercantile knowledge, and thus spent her days in the simple joy of helping those in need.\nUnfortunately, all the joy in the world couldn\u2019t stand up to an epidemic. Thus ended her second life. \nOnce again, she found herself in the moment of her broken engagement, the curtain rising on the third loop. Her next four lives proceeded much the same way. As a skilled lady\u2019s maid, she helped a young noblewoman to a fortuitous marriage. Once, she even disguised herself as a man and became a knight. Every life was worth living, and she enjoyed them all. She enjoyed living, period.\nThere was just one problem.\nNo matter what I do, I die at twenty.\nShe enjoyed her lives, but she was not permitted to do so for long. With this time limit always hanging over her, she spent each loop in a state of constant activity.\nI would love to take it easy for a while. Is a little leisure time too much to ask? Obviously I don\u2019t want to die either! This time, I\u2019ll make as much money as I can in the first five years. Then, when I turn twenty, I\u2019ll live a life free of worldly cares. I\u2019ll do whatever\u2019s necessary to stay alive!\nHer mind made up, Rishe began her seventh life in a dead sprint through the palace. Regardless of her future plans, she was in a race against time. She needed to beat the messenger bearing news of her scandal.\nAs she ran, she yanked off her hair ornaments; she planned to sell them and didn\u2019t want to risk losing one. Her hair billowed out behind her, falling in loose waves.\nSuddenly, an idea occurred to her, one she hadn\u2019t had in any of her previous six lives.\nLeaving through the palace gardens would be faster. I can climb down a tree from the balcony.\nRishe had gone to war as a knight in the life just before this one. After the punishing battlefield training, climbing trees was nothing.\nSeamlessly, she changed direction. She raced for the balcony, where she ran into something at full speed.\n\u201cBwargh!\u201d Rishe let out a very unladylike grunt, staggering a few steps. She looked up to see what she\u2019d bounced off of. \u201cOh\u2026\u201d\nAn exceptionally handsome man stood in her path.\nHe had refined, patrician features and cruel, thin lips. He was slender yet powerful; even through",
    "query_text": " his clothes, Rishe could tell his body was well conditioned. His jet-black hair covered his ears, creeping down to the nape of his neck. The tips of his locks bounced with his movements. They looked to be soft to the touch.\nFrom head to toe, he was a pleasure to look at\u2014but what held Ris"

    "prefix_text": " you again.\u201d\n\u201cHmm? What are you grumbling about?\u201d Dietrich looked Rishe up and down. \u201cI knew it. You put on a brave face, but I can sense the sorrow in your heart.\u201d\n\u201cI beg your pardon?\u201d\n\u201cYour heart!\u201d the prince repeated. \u201cYour heart! It must be absolutely crushed! Because I called off our engagement!\u201d\nRishe wasn\u2019t sure where he was drawing these conclusions from. Possibly the same place he mined for all his bottomless self-confidence.\n\u201cI can tell you\u2019ve been wandering aimlessly, distraught,\u201d the prince went on. \u201cLook at you. Your dress is caked in mud, your shoes are broken, and there are cuts marring your face and arms. What other possible cause could there be than heartbreak?\u201d\nRishe narrowed her eyes. \u201cDo you ever stop to think about the words coming out of your mouth?\u201d\n\u201cWhat?\u201d\nHis interpretation of events was fanciful to the point of absurdity. \u201cI did not dirty my dress or snap my shoes out of heartbreak. Because I feel none. You\u2019ve always been a little slow, so I\u2019ll make this clear: I do not have a single shred of fondness for you, or for our broken engagement.\u201d\n\u201cWhat?!\u201d the prince said. \u201cWhat are you saying?!\u201d\nThe surrounding crowd began to snicker.\n\u201cIsn\u2019t that the crown prince? Did Lady Rishe just dump him?\u201d\n\u201cWait, but wasn\u2019t he trying to dump her?\u201d\n\u201cCan\u2019t be! Look at her! She doesn\u2019t care at all!\u201d\n\u201cHow dare you nobodies make sport of me?\u201d Dietrich screeched. \u201cI am your prince!\u201d\nTemper aside, Dietrich was a handsome man. He had azure-blue eyes and blond hair\u2014a prince straight out of a picture book. His looks and place in the succession meant a never-ending swarm of women vying for his affections. He was brought up a pampered princeling, never wanting for anything. It manifested in a pompous manner and an overconfidence in his own abilities. Rishe had cautioned him about his attitude before, but he never paid her any mind.\nI\u2019m so glad I don\u2019t have to marry him.\nShe wished she could go back and tell the shocked, scared girl from her first life not to worry about her shattered engagement. Still, she might as well say it all here and now, with the assembled knights and citizens to bear witness.\n\u201cYour Highness, you exist to love and protect your people. It\u2019s unbecoming to speak of them in this manner.\u201d\n\u201cYou\u2019re the unbecoming one!\u201d the prince snapped. \u201cBeg me for forgiveness!\u201d\n\u201cI won\u2019t. Calling off our betrothal is the best course, and I applaud Your Highness for your good sense.\u201d\nNow even the knights were trembling with suppressed mirth. \nDietrich was turning red. \u201cD-don\u2019t laugh at me!\u201d\n\u201cLady Rishe,\u201d came a sweet voice. \u201cAren\u2019t you ashamed of yourself?\u201d \nRishe fought down a groan.\nOut of the crowd stepped a charming, dainty girl. Her big eyes moist with tears, she took her place at Dietrich\u2019s side. \u201cI do not allow the people I care about to be treated so very ill!\u201d \n\u201cWhy, Lady Mary. You\u2019re here.\u201d Rishe sighed. \u201cHow nice.\u201d\nThe young Mary scowled through her tears. Hidden behind her skirts, Dietrich continued to shout his disapproval. \u201cRishe! You\u2019ve brought my beloved Mary to tears! She\u2019s told me everything. How you bullied her, ridiculed her. How you find it amusing to lock her in the classroom overnight! Such a wicked woman could never be queen!\u201d\nNone of that\u2019s true.\nRishe glanced at Mary, who averted her gaze a little awkwardly.\n\u201cMore importantly,\u201d Rishe said, \u201chave you already brought your concerns to my parents, Your Highness?\u201d\n\u201cMore importantly?! I did, if you must know! Your parents are furious. They have vowed to disown you.\u201d\n\u201cAh. Then I\u2019m too late.\u201d Her parents held their reputation above all else. Rishe had little hope of retrieving any of her money or belongings now.\n\u201cWhy are you acting so strangely?\u201d Dietrich sniffed. \u201cAh, I understand. You\u2019re in such shock from this turn of events that\u2014\u201d\n\u201cListen, Dietrich.\u201d In her exasperation, Rishe dropped his title. \u201cI accept your decree. We are no longer engaged. I shall never darken your doorstep again. So\u2026relax a little.\u201d\n\u201cHuh? What are you saying?\u201d\n\u201cSince I was a child, I believed that my only value was in our betrothal. Being engaged to the crown prince was my whole reason for living. I was wrong about that. Only I determine my value\u2014no one else. That\u2019s why I don\u2019t care about this. I\u2019m beyond it.\u201d Rishe made sure to look him directly in the eye as she spoke. \u201cYou are an unnecessary element in my life.\u201d\nDietrich staggered back. His legs seemed to go out from under him, and he crumpled. At that, the knights finally let go of their composure, laughing along with the courtiers.\n\u201cSt-stop!\u201d the prince wailed. \u201cYou are my subjects. This\u2026this shows such flagrant disrespect!\u201d\n\u201cDietrich, don\u2019t pay them any mind,\u201d Lady Mary said. \u201cLady Rishe, is this cruelty necessary?\u201d\n\u201cPerhaps this is a blessing in disguise.\u201d Rishe\u2019s attention moved to Mary, making the girl\u2019s slender shoulders jump. She had no reason to worry; Rishe didn\u2019t bite. \u201cI\u2019ve been wanting the opportunity to speak to you, Lady Mary. You\u2019re strong. I admire you very much.\u201d\n\u201cWhat are you talking about?\u201d\n\u201cYou\u2019re a lovely girl who never fails to smile despite your troubles. You don\u2019t put up walls around your heart, and you do your utmost to put others at ease. Even now, you bravely stand before me to protect the prince.\u201d\nMary\u2019s eyes were wide with confusion. Rishe picked her words carefully, attempting to diminish the girl\u2019s guilty feelings, if only a little. \u201cYou need to marry the prince for your family\u2019s sake, right?\u201d\n\u201cHow do you\u2014?\u201d\nRishe had learned this truth in one of her past lives. Mary was born to a poor family, and she had studied like mad to be accepted into the academy to hunt for a husband. She intended to make sure neither she nor her brothers ever went hungry again.\nShe went on, \u201cRemember this: you are the one in control of your life. Don\u2019t sell it to anyone else. Can you trust a man who so easily discards the woman he\u2019s been engaged to since childhood? Do you truly believe he cares for you?\u201d\nAstonishment bloomed across Mary\u2019s face. She looked over at Dietrich, who hadn\u2019t bothered to stand up. The truth was\u2026within a year, Prince Dietrich would be in prison, his title stripped from him. He would plan a mad coup d\u2019\u00e9tat against the king, attempting to provoke the citizens to war. His plan would be discovered in its early stages, rendering him a laughingstock across the kingdom.\n\u201cYou must shape your future with your own hands\u2014you mustn\u2019t entrust your desires to others.\u201d \n\u201cMy\u2026my desires?\nRishe nodded.\nMary was looking at her like she was speaking a foreign language. \u201cBut I\u2019m their elder sister.\u201d Her voice quivered. \u201cI must endure, no matter what. Otherwise, my brothers will never be happy.\u201d\n\u201cAnd you believe their happiness can only be achieved by sacrificing your own?\u201d\nMary gasped as she gaped at Rishe.\n\u201cYou don\u2019t need to throw away your own future to protect those you love,\u201d Rishe told her. \u201cNo matter what path you choose, never forget that.\u201d\n\u201cMy future?\u201d Mary\u2019s voice went ragged, like she was barely suppressing a wail of pain.\n\u201cI wish you a life where both you and your family can be happy,\u201d said Rishe.\nMary stood frozen in place, eyes gleaming like precious stones. Rishe couldn\u2019t help but admire how pretty she was. She truly did wish her happiness. But right now, she needed to take care of herself. \n\u201cWell.\u201d Rishe suddenly broke into a smile, making Dietrich flinch. \u201cI think it\u2019s time for me to be on my way.\u201d\nShe regretted losing access to her room, but she knew her parents wouldn\u2019t let her in. Turning her back on the crowd, Rishe contemplated her next move.\n\u201cWait, Lady Rishe!\u201d Mary\u2019s voice rang out.\n\u201cThat\u2019s right. You\u2019re not going anywhere, Rishe!\u201d The prince joined her. \u201cYou won\u2019t get away with treating me like trash to relieve your own injured heart.\u201d\n\u201cUgh, enough already!\u201d Rishe\u2019s patience was fraying. \u201cI don\u2019t have anything else to say to you. Goodbye!\u201d\n\u201cKnights, stop her!\u201d\nReluctantly, the knights moved to tail Rishe as she walked briskly back down the path. She sympathized with them, but she wasn\u2019t about to let them keep her here. Rounding a corner, she sensed something uncanny. She stopped, the knights quickly catching up with her.\n\u201cMy apologies, Lady Rishe. If you could please remain for just a\u2014whoa!\u201d\nRishe grabbed the hilt of the knight\u2019s sword. Yanking it from his belt, she spun around and stood at the ready. Metal rang against metal as Rishe parried a blow. She glared at her would-be attacker as he stepped out of the shadows.\nArnold Hein!\n\u201cWell, what do you know.\u201d The man smiling so sweetly while their swords locked was the very man who had ended her life. \u201cYou do have some skill.\u201d\nMetal screeched and slid, before Arnold sheathed his sword. Rishe lowered hers. Neither looked away.\n\u201cWho the hell are you?\u201d demanded one of the knights.\n\u201cStand down, good sirs,\u201d Rishe said. \u201cYour interference will only make this worse.\u201d\nThis mostly served to befuddle the knights further. Rishe absolutely couldn\u2019t allow them to come to blows with the crown prince of a friendly nation. And they couldn\u2019t beat him\u2014not even if they took him all at once. Rishe had blocked his blow, but her arm was completely numb. To think he\u2019d be even more powerful in five years.\nHe regarded her unabashedly. \u201cRishe, was that your name? Where did you learn such swordsmanship?\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m afraid I cannot say. Besides, you were clearly going easy on me.\u201d\n\u201cHa! You could tell?\u201d\nArnold\u2019s manner was throwing her off. He seemed to be enjoying himself. He\u2019s laughing. This monstrous prince is\u2026actually laughing.\nWhen she had met him in her other life, he was cold and merciless, like a genuine monster. And yet here he stood, mellow and smiling.\nThe Emperor Arnold Hein I knew was twenty-four years old, so he\u2019s, what? Nineteen now? This is so weird. He\u2019s grinning like a boy getting into a scrape.\nThat attack had been good-natured as well, almost playful. It had muscle behind it but certainly not any lethal intent. He\u2019d just wanted to force Rishe to catch the blow. She found it unbelievable that he could exude such an overpowering air of menace when he was just messing around.\nWhile Rishe was focused on Arnold, Mary and Dietrich caught up, seemingly recovered.\n\u201cExcuse me, my lord!\u201d Mary squeaked. \u201cI-I-I don\u2019t know who you are, but kindly step away from Lady Rishe!\u201d\n\u201cYes, do as she says! Who the hell are you, anyway?!\u201d\nDon\u2019t tell me Prince Dietrich doesn\u2019t recognize one of his personal guests.\nDietrich\u2019s interests did not lean toward diplomacy; he likely hadn\u2019t bothered to introduce himself to Arnold. Mary, for her part, seemed to grasp that Arnold wasn\u2019t ordinary. She stood up to defend Rishe, despite the tremble in her voice. In a better world, perhaps the two of them could have become friends.\n\u201cThat\u2019s your ex-fianc\u00e9?\u201d Arnold cocked a brow. \u201cHe\u2019s even worse than I imagined. Pathetic.\u201d\nDietrich flushed. \u201cI\u2019ll have your head!\u201d\n\u201cDietrich, I beg of you, contain yourself,\u201d Rishe said, then rounded on Arnold. \u201cAs for you, Your Highness\u2014you know who Dietrich is, and you know what speaking carelessly could mean. Are you trying to pick a fight?\u201d\n\u201cWhatever do you mean?\u201d Arnold\u2019s brows lifted high, making him the picture of innocence. \u201cBelieve me, Lady Rishe, every word I speak is chosen with extreme care.\u201d\nFinally realizing who Arnold was, Dietrich visibly paled. \u201cArnold? He\u2019s the crown prince of Galkhein?\u201d\nMary yelped. The knights stood down, shamefaced. The gossip-hungry neighbors who\u2019d gathered to witness a scandal play out drew back in fear.\n\u201cHe\u2019s the demon prince? The one who single-handedly destroyed a whole order of enemy knights?\u201d\n\u201cWatch your tongue, fool! Do you want him to do the same to you?\u201d\nThe two nations enjoyed peaceful relations, but Arnold remained the dreaded prince, heir to the throne of a former enemy. Current rumor wasn\u2019t as widespread as it would be in five years, but he was still regarded with distrust.\nThe onlookers stood rooted to the spot, too terrified to flee.\nWell, this has devolved into a full-fledged disaster.\nRishe heaved a frustrated sigh. \u201cPrince Arnold, to what do we owe this honor? Surely a crown prince would not draw his sword for a mere jest.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m here on business,\u201d Arnold said. \u201cBut first, I must beg forgiveness for my rudeness.\u201d\nHuh, what do you know? Once he became emperor, he\u2019d gladly behead any subject who so much as dared speak a word against him.\nI guess at nineteen he still knew how to apologize.\nIf that surprised her, Arnold\u2019s next act completely obliterated her sense of reality. \nWith a flourish, he fell to his knees. \n\u201cHuh?\u201d Is this actually happening? \nHe was a man destined for an imperial crown. A man who would stand at the head of a military powerhouse and spread his rule across continents.\nArnold, known for his frigid pride, knelt to the disgraced daughter of a duke.\nAnd not only that\u2014his head was bowed, looking nothing so much as a knight swearing allegiance to his lady. If it were anyone else, it would be a delightful, pious image. Instead, the assembled looked on in terrified awe.\nNot Rishe, though.\n\u201cWhat are you doing?\u201d she hissed. \u201cGet up!\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m apologizing for my baseless impertinence. Also, I\u2019m asking you\u2026\u201d He trailed off to take Rishe\u2019s hand, tugging her forward so forcefully she staggered. He gazed up at her.\nUgh. He\u2019s so beautiful. No matter how many times she looked at him, it didn\u2019t become any less disarming. Long eyelashes, arched brows, a noble nose. His bright blue eyes reminded her of the drift ice she\u2019d seen in a northern kingdom, gazing out from a ship in one of her past lives. She knew she was dwelling on this to buy time, even as the reality before her sank in.\n\u201c\u2026to become my wife.\u201d\nShe froze, unable to process the words. \u201cWhat?\u201d Rishe glanced around, desperately searching the faces of the crowd. They all seemed as stunned as she felt. She looked down at Arnold again. \u201cYour wife?\u201d \n\u201cYes, that\u2019s right.\u201d\n\u201cYou want me to become your wife?\u201d\n\u201cYes.\u201d\nRishe couldn\u2019t speak. This was truly happening. It was real. It clicked into place in her head, and she let out a strangled grunt.\nWhat is going on? Why is this happening?\nShock lapped at her, fuzzing at the corners of her vision. He wanted to marry her. Arnold wanted to marry Rishe. Her murderer wanted to marry her.\nWhy is he doing this? He must have some ulterior motive, a broader goal. But I have to give him an answer.\nThe onlookers were holding their breath as Rishe said flatly, \u201cI reject your proposal.\u201d\nArnold said nothing.\nShe had to reject him. She was going to live a long, peaceful, carefree life, damn it, and no one would stop her. And yet\u2026\nArnold began to laugh, and the deep, creeping sense of dread inside Rishe only grew. Why does he seem so amused by this?!\n \n***\n \nHer previous life was her sixth. Disguised as a man, Rishe rose as a warrior of an island country she came upon in her travels. It was a conventional yet charming kingdom formed of red brick. After striking up a friendship with a group of knights who didn\u2019t realize she was a woman, Rishe followed their advice and joined them.\nThe training",

Back when she had lived as a noble, she\u2019d learned how to wield a sword for basic self-defense, but training as a noble lady had in no way prepared her for this. She drilled relentlessly, barely taking the time to sleep. Just as she became a full-fledged knight, Emperor Arnold\u2019s forces lay siege to the castle.\n \n***\n \nHow could this happen? \n"

I am completely under your spell.\u201d\nTo think he could spout such nonsense with a straight face!\n\u201cThen will you grant me anything I desire?\u201d\n\u201cSo long as it is within my power,\u201d Arnold said. \u201cAnything you want will be yours.\u201d\nRishe hesitated, gathering her thoughts. \u201cI have some conditions.\u201d Arnold silently motioned for her to go on. \u201cI want full control over the wedding festivities. Everything must be procured through merchants of my choosing.\u201d\n\u201cFine.\u201d Arnold nodded. \u201cYou\u2019re free to do business with whomever you wish.\u201d\n\u201cAfter we are married, I must be in a position to mingle with guests from abroad.\u201d\n\u201cThat sounds within the purview of the crown princess. Anything else?\u201d\n\u201cI will be allowed to live in a separate residence from your mother and father.\u201d\nShe meant this seriously, but it made Arnold laugh. \u201cYou don\u2019t seem the type to worry about an overbearing mother-in-law.\u201d\n\u201cYou would be surprised. Combative relationships with one\u2019s new family are the most difficult part of marriage, or so they say. It could be a ramshackle cottage for all I care\u2014I just require a secondary residence.\u201d\nActually, Rishe didn\u2019t care at all about in-laws. When Arnold set his war into motion, his first move would be the assassination of his father. A genuine coup by patricide, not at all like Dietrich\u2019s clumsy attempt. Next, he would name himself emperor, take control of the country, and mobilize the military.\nSeparating him from his parents will make the first step more difficult\u2014although not impossible, unfortunately.\n\u201cAnything else?\u201d Arnold asked. \u201cI\u2019ll do whatever it takes to marry you.\u201d\n\u201cIdeally, I\u2019d like to know your endgame,\u201d Rishe said with dignity. \u201cBut as I doubt there\u2019s any chance of that, I have one final request.\u201d She jabbed a finger into his face, regardless of how rude it was. \u201cI will spend my time idling around the castle. No work, no study. I shall be utterly useless.\u201d\nLet\u2019s see just how much you want me as your princess.\nAfter a long moment of silence, Arnold cracked a merry laugh. The proposal remained; all her conditions were met.\n\n(2) chapter number given is likely out of range: 0\nChapter: 7\n\nChapter 2\nChapter 2\n \n\u201cYOU KNOW, it was only after I went into commerce that I truly had a dream for the future,\u201d Rishe had once confided in a friend. \u201cUp until then, I existed only as the crown prince\u2019s fianc\u00e9e or my father\u2019s daughter. My every act was to become more worthy of that status. But now, for the first time, I actually have a goal of my own.\u201d\n\u201cOh, yeah?\u201d her friend said. He was the ruler of the desert kingdom, and his smile was awfully charming. \u201cWhat\u2019s that?\u201d\nRishe smiled back. \u201cI want to travel to every single country in the world. I want to see everything in every town, peruse their markets, and meet the eyes of every person who lives there!\u201d\nBy now, that felt like such a distant dream.\n \n***\n \nRishe awoke with a start, eyes snapping open as she sensed a disturbance in the air.\nShe unsheathed her sword halfway, primed for danger. \nInside the coach, her old enemy sat across from her, one hand outstretched. \u201cWhat do you think you\u2019re doing?\u201d she demanded.\nWhen they\u2019d boarded the coach, Rishe had warned him not to lay a single finger on her throughout the trip to his kingdom. Ordering the prince not to touch his consort was absurd, but Arnold readily agreed. He had, after all, promised to follow her every direction.\nAnd yet, here he was, already breaking his promise.\nArnold appeared unperturbed by her glare. \u201cDon\u2019t look at me like that. I was merely trying to recover what you took from me.\u201d\nConfused, Rishe looked at the sword in her hand. It had a black lacquered scabbard with a simple golden decoration. Engraved on the hilt was the Galkhein crest.\n\u201cOh!\u201d Rishe thrust the sword back at Arnold. \u201cMy apologies.\u201d\nArnold chuckled. \u201cYou caught me off guard. You were nodding off, and then you suddenly snatched up my sword. You looked quite content snuggling up with it.\u201d\nArnold propped the sword beside him. Rishe pressed a hand to her chest to quell her racing heart. The sword that gutted me in my previous life is now my bedmate. What a world. Her recent stint as a knight had left her ill at ease without a blade at hand. She just couldn\u2019t believe it was Arnold\u2019s she\u2019d reached for.\n\u201cI didn\u2019t mean to disturb you, but I doubted sleeping with a weapon would be comfortable. I\u2019m impressed you sensed my intent before I even touched you.\u201d Arnold rested one elbow against the window frame, watching her with shameless fascination. \u201cOne only develops instincts like that from combat training. And you were also a member of the court? How in the world did you find the time?\u201d\nRishe shrugged. She couldn\u2019t just say, I pretended to be a man in a previous life, that\u2019s how.\n\u201cI assume there\u2019s more to you than your devotion to the sword. You seem to like flowers.\u201d\nShe followed Arnold\u2019s gaze to where she\u2019d bundled a small bouquet in a handkerchief. This was their fifth day on the road to Galkhein. Every day, without fail, she\u2019d picked flowers whenever they stopped to water the horses. The ones from today were still fresh, but the ones she\u2019d begun drying five days ago were just about ready.\n\u201cI didn\u2019t pick these because they\u2019re pretty.\u201d Rishe brought the blooms to her face, spirits rising at their sweet scent. Spring wildflowers had a soft and gentle smell. Rishe looked out the window at the forest spreading toward Galkhein, thinking of the rare native flowers going into bloom. She wished she could pick those as well, but that would cause too much delay. She gazed on wistfully.\nAfter watching her in silence for some time, Arnold said, \u201cBy the way, I sent one of my men ahead on a fast horse to deliver your order to the company you requested. They\u2019ll be invited to Galkhein to discuss the wedding ceremony.\u201d\n\u201cThank you,\u201d Rishe said. \u201cI\u2019m glad you kept your word.\u201d\n\u201cThe Aria Trading Company,\u201d Arnold mused. \u201cI\u2019ve heard of them. They\u2019re up-and-comers, aren\u2019t they? Have you done business with them before?\u201d\n\u201cNo, but I heard from a friend that they hold a very high standard of quality.\u201d\nRishe was pleasantly surprised at how easily Arnold had acceded to her request. Typically, a royal household had their own personal dealer. Getting them to do business with someone else could be difficult.\nI want to establish a connection with Aria as soon as possible, Rishe thought. It was, of course, the company that had taken her in during her first life.\nThe company had been established just two years prior to picking her up by its owner, a man named Tully. They were still in their growth stage, but in just a few years, they would be the grandest trading company in all the world. They\u2019d proven a great boon in her life as an apothecary as well, helping to distribute her newest medicines. She\u2019d struggled to win their trust initially, but she pledged to work much harder this time around.\nThis marriage isn\u2019t going to happen\u2014I need an escape plan for when it all falls apart. I must bring to bear all my knowledge and influence as a crown princess.\nRishe didn\u2019t know Arnold\u2019s plans, but she had no intention of sitting around and waiting for him to use her as he pleased. She\u2019d spend her time as his consort wisely. Everything must serve her ultimate goal: to live longer than five years, and live well.\nHer fierce determination must have shown on her face because Arnold gave her a little bemused smile. \u201cYes?\u201d\nGod! Rishe grimaced at that flawlessly handsome countenance. Such beauty, possessed by such powerful destruction. The fact that he\u2019d been the man to kill her did nothing to lessen her fascination. In fact, it almost made it worse. The study of contrasts.\n\u201cSorry, I just\u2014\u201d\nShe was interrupted by the horses\u2019 loud whinnies.\n\u201cStop! Hey, stop the coach!\u201d\nShouts drifted back from conveyance ahead of theirs, which contained the luggage and attendants. The squadron of knights tailing the column of coaches sped off toward the front.\n\u201cWho do you think you\u2014graaargh!\u201d\nThat didn\u2019t sound good. Rishe moved to climb out, but Arnold was faster. He drew his sword.\n\u201cHey!\u201d\nArnold locked the door from the outside. \u201cStay hidden.\u201d\nWhy is he putting himself in danger? That\u2019s what knights are for! The fact that Rishe had been about to do the same thing didn\u2019t occur to her. It\u2019s probably bandits. He told me to stay hidden in here, but I\u2019m not so sure about that.\nArnold had left her locked in from the outside, hoping to keep her safe, but Rishe didn\u2019t like her odds. There were five coaches, but this one was certainly the grandest. It locked on the inside as well, but that wouldn\u2019t stop someone with enough determination. If she did as she was told, she\u2019d just be waiting patiently for a bandit to break a window and drag her out.\nKeeping one eye on the coachmen fleeing into the forest, Rishe began a methodical search for something to help her. Right\u2014her hairpin!\nThis sure brings me back. She unfastened it, twisting it into the gap in the door. Back when I was a maid, my lady would lock herself in her chambers all the time to avoid her studies. I had to break her out just like this.\nThe lock on the coach was simple, and it came open easily. Once she was free, she scanned her surroundings. She didn\u2019t see anyone who looked immediately hostile, but there was noise up ahead. Cautiously, she headed toward it.\nBefore long, she found Arnold.\nWow.\nRoughly ten men\u2014the bandits, she presumed\u2014lay crumpled on the ground. In their midst stood Arnold, in the process of tripping another man into the dirt. He scowled, blade at the man\u2019s throat. \u201cIs that it, then?\u201d\n\u201cGwugh!\u201d\nArnold kicked the bandit in the stomach, eyes blazing with cruelty. \u201cThat\u2019s all the thrill you offer me after I went to",
    "query_text": " the trouble of drawing my sword? Barely worth it. I\u2019m bored already.\u201d\nHe wasn\u2019t angry; on the contrary, he stared his enemies down with chilly disappointment, as if this had all been a letdown. Even Arnold\u2019s own knights seemed terrified of their master when he was in a mood. Arnold smoothly flicked the blood off his sword, wiping the blade on the bandit\u2019s shirt before sheathing it. The rest of the"

    "prefix_text": ",\u201d Arnold protested. \u201cI thought you were going to hurt yourself.\u201d\nSuch a simple conversation, so casual. It had Rishe feeling positively peculiar.\n\u201cWhy are your knights so wary around me?\u201d she asked. \n\u201cWary? Oh, they were all at the palace when you broke your first engagement. They\u2019re most likely concerned I\u2019m bringing home a villainous jilt who will lead to my ruin. Something silly like that.\u201d\n\u201cI see.\u201d Apparently, being dumped by a prince called into question one\u2019s herbalist abilities.\n\u201cI\u2019m glad you mentioned it,\u201d Arnold went on, \u201cbecause there may be people in Galkhein who will oppose our union. I will do everything in my power to protect you, but you must bring any insults or threats to me right away.\u201d\n\u201cAre there likely to be many?\u201d\n\u201cIn theory, the crown prince may choose his own wife, but the done thing is, of course, to marry a princess. I assume a duke\u2019s daughter would have at least some ties to the royal family?\u201d\nHe assumed correctly. She was in the family tree, if a rather distant branch.\n\u201cMy father has ordered me to choose a bride from a different kingdom rather than a woman of my own land because\u2014\u201d\n\u201cOne never knows when a hostage will come in handy,\u201d Rishe finished for him.\nGalkhein was an expansionist empire. Currently, peace reigned\u2014but peace was precarious. If Galkhein demanded any of the countries to hand over a princess bride, then none were in a position to refuse. With his daughter in the hands of a foreign power, no king would dare oppose a war that power cared to wage.\n\u201cI sent a message to my father telling him I happened upon a close relation of Hermity\u2019s king\u2014a duke\u2019s daughter who had been recently tossed aside by her fianc\u00e9e,\u201d Arnold said. \u201cI also may have implied I was the reason for your falling out\u2014yours and the prince\u2019s. Why, when I saw a woman so powerful and connected and beloved, I couldn\u2019t help but plunder you.\u201d\n\u201cPlunder me? That\u2019s certainly one way to describe it.\u201d Dietrich had kicked up an almighty fuss, despite being the one who broke the engagement.\n\u201cMy father approves of you because he sees you as a bargaining chip. There will be others who aren\u2019t prepared to accept you so willingly.\u201d\n\u201cIs that so?\u201d Rishe said steadily.\n\u201cNever fear,\u201d Arnold responded. \u201cThey\u2019ll eat their words, every one of them. They will receive you as their crown princess if they value their\u2014\u201d\n\u201cNo, being a hostage is perfect.\u201d \nArnold stared at her. \u201cHm?\u201d\n\u201cAs a hostage, I\u2019ll have no official duties, will I? We can pretend I\u2019m here only under great duress, and there will be no need for my comment on governmental or diplomatic affairs.\u201d\nArnold hesitated. \u201cI suppose not.\u201d\n\u201cExcellent! Then I can live my dream of being utterly useless.\u201d Rishe trembled with delight. The thought of acting as an ambassador had really been weighing on her mind. Being a princess was nonstop work. Having been groomed for the position from an early age, Rishe knew members of the royal family barely even had time to sleep.\nBut prisoners didn\u2019t have places in government.\n\u201cThis is such a weight off my mind,\u201d Rishe admitted. \u201cThank you so much for keeping your promise, Your Highness.\u201d\n\u201cEr, of course.\u201d\n\u201cBut don\u2019t worry, I won\u2019t shirk my duties as wedding planner.\u201d Nearly ready to collapse with relief, Rishe returned to her herbs.\n \n***\n \nAfter the bandit incident, Rishe felt the knights begin to ease a bit in her presence.\nDespite their initial reluctance to accept her help, they continued to report the injured men\u2019s progress and bring any concerns directly to her. In return, they took over gathering herbs from the surrounding countryside on their rest stops.\nShe hadn\u2019t done it for gratitude, but she was nonetheless touched. Gathering medicinal herbs had been second nature ever since her life as an apothecary, and it was foolish to ever turn down loyalty.\nSeveral days after the altercation with the bandits, the coach train finally arrived in the imperial capital of Galkhein.\n\u201cOh my,\u201d Rishe murmured as they passed through the gates.\nWhite stone buildings stood in straight rows, lining clean, orderly streets. The first stories all appeared to be shops, while the second-floor windows were festooned with flowers. Everywhere she looked were smiling faces, citizens turned out to witness their prince\u2019s return over the smooth brick roads. Overlooking it all was the towering magnificence of the imperial palace.\n\u201cThe capital is the seat of power in Galkhein,\u201d Arnold explained. \u201cSeveral key trade routes converge here.\u201d\nRishe nodded, suddenly anxious to be out of the coach. More and more people were gathering to watch their progress, some carrying shopping bags in both arms or holding hands with children. Many of them waved, as if greeting someone dear to them.\nHappy citizens and clean, orderly streets meant wealth. Galkhein was well-off. Rishe couldn\u2019t help but grin at an adorable little girl watching them roll by with sparkling eyes. When she saw Rishe\u2019s smile, she blushed and leapt up in the air, laughing with delight.\nThe coach made its way through the city before passing through the castle gates. Lines of disciplined knights flanked the road, ready to greet the crown prince and his fianc\u00e9e.\nArnold stepped out of the coach, holding out his hand to Rishe. She took it reflexively as she alighted. A prince would be expected to help any lady out of carriage, never mind his own consort, yet for some reason the knights looked a bit disturbed.\nRishe shot them back of look of innocent confusion.\n\u201cOur long journey is at last at its end, Your Highness, Lady Rishe.\u201d Oliver emerged from the ranks of the knights, bowing. He shot Arnold a curious glance. \u201cHow novel to see you taking the hand of your fianc\u00e9e.\u201d\nAh! Rishe realized that she herself had willingly broken the condition that she had imposed. Arnold had offered his hand, but she was the one who accepted.\nArnold gave a little laugh of triumph. Rishe felt a rush of frustration at being tricked. \nOliver stared at them before leaning in to whisper in Arnold\u2019s ear. Arnold let out a breath of annoyance. \n\u201cIs something the matter?\u201d Rishe asked.\n\u201cI sent orders ahead to have a detached wing of the palace prepared for us, but it seems the preparations are behind schedule. I\u2019m sorry, but you\u2019ll need to stay in a guest room in the main palace for a few days.\u201d\n\u201cOh, I don\u2019t mind if the wing isn\u2019t ready,\u201d Rishe said. \u201cWe can head over there now.\u201d\n\u201cIt hasn\u2019t been used in quite a while. It\u2019ll be covered in dust.\u201d\n\u201cI said that I didn\u2019t mind if it was a mess, remember? But there\u2019s no need for you to put yourself out. By all means, stay in the main palace for as long as you need",

Your citizens are clean and happy, your knights are proper and kind. Oh, and another\u2014\u201d \nRishe broke off enumerating Galkhein\u2019s charms as Arnold turned to look at her. His face was impassively calm, but something seemed to pass by underneath, like a shadow in deep water.\n\u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d Rishe said. \u201cDid I say something odd?\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m just amazed you could be so unaware of yourself.\u201d \nWh-what a rude thing to\u2014\n\u201cI\u2019ve never met anyone like you. No one has ever spoken to me the way you do. I don\u2019t know any girls of your class with the knowledge or the physical abilities you possess. Noblewomen don\u2019t concern themselves with such things.\u201d\nRishe, there is no need for you to think for yourself.\nShe frowned. \u201cPerhaps you\u2019re right, but everything I\u2019ve learned is precious to me. No one can take my skills away\u2014I value them with my life. Some may say that my knowledge is worthless, but it makes no difference to me.\u201d She turned from the balcony, fixing him with a piercing gaze. \u201cI\u2019m the one who decides what I value.\u201d\nRishe had clawed free of her mother and father\u2019s indoctrination a long time ago. Man, woman\u2014it didn\u2019t matter. She could do anything. Being queen was not the culmination of her life; she wouldn\u2019t trade her freedom for anything.\nArnold matched her intensity. \u201cYou\u2019re right.\u201d He gently cupped her cheek in a one hand, swiping his thumb along the line of her jaw, smearing dust. \u201cLive your life here however you wish. I vow to do my utmost to protect you.\u201d\n\u201cHuh?\u201d\nHis vehemence took her by surprise. Arnold had every right to demand she act the part of a proper consort. This was a political marriage; Rishe was essentially a hostage, after all. Yet here he was, cosigning her misbehavior. Moreover, he was all but swearing to defend her from the consequences.\n\u201cWhy?\u201d\n\u201cYou know why. I\u2019m enamored with you.\u201d Arnold fed her the same line. \u201cI know you said you don\u2019t care about other people\u2019s approval, but I like your asymmetrical talents. I don\u2019t find them useless at all.\u201d \nRishe didn\u2019t know how to respond.\n\u201cI thought I\u2019d already made that clear.\u201d He took his hand back, drawing away, stopping just on the threshold. He turned back to a stunned Rishe and said, \u201cLet me know if there\u2019s anything you desire. I realize I just broke our agreement\u2014the one about not touching you.\u201d\nAnd with that, he was gone.\nShaken, Rishe sank to the floor of the balcony. I can\u2019t predict him at all! Just what is Arnold Hein planning?\nThe quiet of evening fell over the imperial capital of Galkhein.\n \n***\n \n\u201cMmm.\u201d\nSunshine streamed through the window as Rishe roused from sleep. She rolled over, basking in the morning light. The wall she expected wasn\u2019t there, and the bed seemed larger than usual. Taking advantage of it, she stretched out as far as she could.\nWas this her chamber at home? Or maybe she was a merchant again, spending a night at the desert king\u2019s palace. Perhaps this was her bed of straw from her life as a maid? Her memories met and interwove as she drifted into wakefulness.\nWhen Rishe finally opened her eyes, she grew even more confused.\nLight blue curtains surrounded the bed, thin enough to allow sunlight to pass through. She pulled them aside to find herself in a bare room devoid of furniture and carpet.\nOh, right. She didn\u2019t need to report for morning training, tend to her herb garden, prepare breakfast, or see how the bottles she had brewed overnight were coming along.\nRealizing that, Rishe buried her face in the pillow. \u201cSo soft,\u201d she murmured. \nJudging by the position of the sun, it was about six o\u2019clock in the morning. She was pretty sure she had gone to bed around midnight last night.\nI slept for six whole hours? Rishe couldn\u2019t believe it. Generally, she was used to getting about four hours of sleep. On bad days, at the height of an emergency as a knight or apothecary, she wouldn\u2019t even get that much. \nI\u2019ve got nothing but cleaning on the schedule today. Hostages can sleep in, right? At least a little? Excitement suffused her at the thought, but that was interrupted by a knock on the door.\n\u201cLady Rishe, are you awake? It\u2019s Oliver\u2014Prince Arnold\u2019s attendant.\u201d\nRishe sat up with a start. \u201cI\u2019m awake!\u201d\nOliver continued to speak through the door. \u201cI apologize for bothering you at such an early hour. I\u2019m here with a delivery.\u201d\n\u201cJust a moment!\u201d Rishe slipped out of the bed, dressed quickly, and tugged the bed\u2019s canopy closed. She opened the door to find Oliver standing in the hallway with a polite smile.\nHe apologized again. \u201cThis was the only time I could slip away from His Highness\u2019s office. I\u2019m glad to see that you\u2019re already dressed.\u201d\n\u201cNot at all.\u201d Rishe paused, stepping back to allow him inside. \u201cOh my. You look exhausted.\u201d\nOliver grimaced. \u201cIs it that obvious? We\u2019ve been climbing through mountains of paperwork, but never mind me. His Highness has been working around the clock.\u201d\nRishe thought back to yesterday, how he had come all the way out to the balcony. He should have used that spare time to sleep. \u201cHe\u2019s in high demand, isn\u2019t he? He was even working on the trip over.\u201d\n\u201cHe finished all the work he brought along with us,\u201d Oliver confirmed. \u201cNow he\u2019s dealing with everything that piled up during his visit to Hermity.\u201d\n\u201cOh.\u201d Rishe grimaced in sympathy. He may have killed her in a past life, but she wouldn\u2019t wish the bureaucracy of kingship on anyone. \u201cIt\u2019s a shame he had to put his work on hold to attend a silly engagement party.\u201d\n\u201cNo matter. That party was how a committed bachelor finally found a bride.\u201d\nHis smile was sincere, but Rishe knew better. She spread her arms. \u201cGo on. Shall I spin around so you have a better view?\u201d\nOliver blinked. \u201cI beg your pardon?\u201d\n\u201cYou\u2019re looking me over like I\u2019m a horse for sale. If there\u2019s anything I can help you with, please let me know.\u201d\nOliver\u2019s brows went up. He let out a little breath of resignation. \u201cHis Highness was right. You do possess the keen perception of a knight. Of course, I\u2019m purely an amateur myself.\u201d\nI\u2019d say this was a merchant\u2019s sixth sense, rather than battle intuition.\nThis wasn\u2019t the first time Rishe had caught Oliver looking at her. It reminded her of the way her noble customers would examine a product, assessing worth and authenticity. Or a merchant weeding out potential merchandise from a wide array of choices.\nIn other words, he was appraising her.\nOliver moved into a deep, sweeping bow. \u201cMy sincerest apologies, my lady. I have been unaccountably rude to my lord\u2019s consort. My behavior was unacceptable.\u201d\nRishe shook her head. \u201cPlease don\u2019t, it\u2019s fine.\u201d It wasn\u2019t unreasonable for the prince\u2019s closest attendant to be wary of strangers. But it did make her curious. \u201cHow long have you worked for Arnold? Have you always been a valet?\u201d\n\u201cI trained as a squire, actually,\u201d Oliver replied. \u201cBut I was injured and dismissed from the order. His Highness took me into his household soon after. I have served him for nearly a decade.\u201d\n\u201cThen maybe you can answer this,\u201d Rishe said. \u201cWhy is Prince Arnold so very intent on making me his wife?\u201d\nOliver hesitated, as if weighing the pros and cons of speaking, \u201cTo be quite honest, I was as surprised as you were. He\u2019s always insisted he had no interest in marriage. But the sight of you in Hermity has changed his mind. Apparently.\u201d\nSo not even his attendant understood his motives. Rishe remained at a complete loss.\n\u201cIf I may, however?\u201d Oliver mistook Rishe\u2019s confusion for anxiety and added, \u201cI have served Prince Arnold for a long time, and never before have I seen him so happy. When he is with you, he laughs. His smiles are sincere.\u201d\nRishe was taken aback. She\u2019d figured all of Arnold\u2019s laughter and teasing was at her expense. His own private jokes.\n\u201cAre you\u2026unhappy with him?\u201d Oliver ventured. \u201cWith his looks, His Highness is exceedingly popular with the ladies of the court, you know.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m sure he has many admirers.\u201d She paused. \u201cWould you really call the way he acts around me \u2018happy\u2019? To me, it seems more like a cat with a mouse.\u201d\nOliver laughed. He didn\u2019t deny it. \u201cI am pleased you understand His Highness so well. Oh, I nearly forgot. Here.\u201d\nHe held out a sheaf of three documents. \u201cThis is the guest list for your wedding. His Highness bids you look over it.\u201d\n\u201cThank you,\u201d Rishe said, pleasantly surprised. She hadn\u2019t even needed to ask. She gave it a quick glance, quickly identifying the most prominent and powerful names.\nKing Zahad, Prince Kyle, Princess Harriet. And from the Kingdom of Domana, we have Lord Jonal attending as the representative of the king. No surprise there.\nMore than a wedding guest register, this was a list of key people from the countries Arnold would go on to antagonize. Even before the murder of the king and the start of the war, there must have been a trigger\u2014a sea change in the affairs of state. Everyone on this list was most likely involved.\nKing Zahad. I hope we can be friends again like in my first life. Hmm\u2026 Prince Kyle is rather frail. I hope he isn\u2019t working himself too hard. He has a strong sense of responsibility\u2014he\u2019ll attend the wedding even though it\u2019ll be a long trip.\nThe sight of these names filled Rishe with a longing for those lives, for the people she\u2019d once known. And sometime in the very near future, they would all be Galkhein\u2019s enemies.\nIf I take matters into my own hands, perhaps I can salvage some of these relationships before they sour. Even if we aren\u2019t allies, we don\u2019t have to be enemies. Anything to stave off the outbreak of war.\nOliver had no idea what was going through Rishe\u2019s head. Brightly, he continued their conversation. \u201cThe ceremony will be held in three months\u2019 time. All preparations must be complete by then. And now\u2026we need to discuss tonight\u2019s party.\u201d\n\u201cTonight\u2019s what?\u201d\nOliver stiffened. \u201cDid His Highness not tell you?\u201d\n\u201cNo, he most certainly did not! There\u2019s to be a party?\u201d\n\u201cUgh, not again!\u201d Oliver dug his knuckles into his forehead.\nRishe put two and two together. She hesitated, then said, \u201cSo there is one, then. As you must know, His Highness is trying to stamp it down without telling me.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d Oliver replied. \u201cHe should have mentioned it to you. You don\u2019t need to attend, but he will. At least, I hope he will. I think I managed to convince him.\u201d\nShe sympathized with Oliver. Under normal circumstances, it would be unheard of for the crown prince and his fianc\u00e9e to fail to appear at a banquet. \u201cDon\u2019t worry, Oliver. I\u2019ll go.\u201d\nOliver let out a sigh of relief. \u201cReally? Thank you so much, my lady. I\u2019ll put finding you a maid at the top of my to-do list.\u201d\n\u201cNo need.\u201d Rishe smiled. \u201cI can prepare for the party on my own.\u201d\nThis maid-selection process made Rishe uneasy. After witnessing that exchange between the servants in the garden, she imagined quarrels breaking out all through the palace. And she doubted the disputes would go away even after they decided.\nOliver frowned. \u201cBut won\u2019t dressing be difficult without a lady\u2019s maid?\u201d \nShe shook her head. \u201cI can do my hair and put on a gown by myself. I brought dresses and cosmetics from home. Don\u2019t worry.\u201d\nRishe ignored Oliver\u2019s stunned look, already reevaluating her cleaning plans.\n \n***\n \nThe first thing Rishe said to Arnold that night was, \u201cYour Highness, I have a request.\u201d Her gown rustled as she leaned in close. \u201cI would like some herb seed and a corner of the gardens. I made a list. I hope we can discuss this in more detail later.\u201d\nArnold was silent a moment. \u201cRishe.\u201d\n\u201cWhat? Didn\u2019t you tell me to let you know if there was anything I wanted?\u201d She looked at him quizzically, and Arnold sighed.\nShe\u2019d heard that he\u2019d finished his mountain of work and even managed to sleep for a while. He was dressed in his usual military black, trimmed with a red mantle and black gloves.\nArnold shook his head. \u201cThat\u2019s not what I mean. I\u2019m guessing that Oliver didn\u2019t tell you the reason for this party? It\u2019s merely for appearance\u2019s sake. I need to look like I\u2019m searching for a bride within our borders as well. There\u2019s no reason for you to attend.\u201d\nIt made sense. The crown prince\u2014the greatest catch in the kingdom\u2014marrying a foreigner without even the slightest nod to propriety would invite unwanted discontent from the nobility.\n\u201cHowever, we\u2019re betrothed,\u201d Arnold said. \u201cThis whole evening is merely a formality. And with news that you\u2019re my",
    "query_text": " \u2018hostage\u2019 going around, you\u2019ll be an object of curiosity. I don\u2019t want to put you through that.\u201d\n\u201cWell, I already went to the trouble of getting ready.\u201d Rishe plucked at her soft blue dress, draped in fluttering layers around her like a flower bud. She\u2019d braided her hair, decorating it with accessories. Her makeup was light, her shoes polished to a mirror shine. Her only jewelry was a pair of pearl earrings.\n\u201cR"

    "prefix_text": ". His ease vexed her, but it was his smugness that made her angry.\nShe let out a hard breath, attempting a maneuver to lure him in while turning. He leaned back, not falling for it at all.\nHe\u2019s just too good at changing his center of gravity! She kept her astonishment under wraps, but she felt it. Despite how close we\u2019re dancing, I can\u2019t throw off his timing at all. He\u2019s sidestepped all my attempts, and he takes back the lead the second I let down my guard!\nIt made her increasingly angry. She twirled and stepped as the dance dictated, all the while feeling out for moments of weakness. Arnold played along with her game, completely unruffled.\nEvery single time. I\u2019m doing my utmost to trip him up, but he doesn\u2019t even seem annoyed! At this point she\u2019d just settle for any reaction at all.\nTheir unusual dance style had gathered a crowd. Rishe paid them no mind, focused only on her goal. Then something occurred to her, and her breath caught in her throat.\nWait a minute, he has left an opening. It\u2019s the same one from before. She thought back to their fight to the death, to that moment when she had managed to draw blood. That may indeed have been his only weakness.\nIf I strike the same way\u2014huh? Before she could try, Arnold appeared to lose patience, wrapping his arm around her waist. He bent her back into a dip so deep it felt like he\u2019d pulled a carpet from under her feet. She yelped, grabbing at him reflexively, clinging tight. His big hands gripped her securely enough to mitigate the sensation of falling. Relief flooded through her, and she felt a laugh rumble against her ear.\nThe music came to an end with one last ringing note. She blinked. The dance is over?\nA hush fell over the ballroom. Then cheers broke out, followed by a round of applause.\n\u201cThat was incredible!\u201d\nThe watching nobles crowded in.\n\u201cYou two moved in such perfect harmony!\u201d\n\u201cI was on the edge of my seat. I felt like I was watching a sword duel!\u201d\n\u201cIs this a dance from Hermity? I\u2019ve never seen such steps before.\u201d\n\u201cUh, well\u2026\u201d Rishe floundered. She glanced up at Arnold, who appeared to be enjoying her struggle. She\u2019d get no help from him.\nRishe dealt with the barrage of questions as best she could, letting the crowd sweep them into the dining room, which was set up for a buffet-style meal. She made sure to greet every guest, riveting their faces into her memory.\nShe must have been acting peculiar, because Arnold eventually said, \u201cRishe, I think the wine is getting to you. Shall we get some fresh air?\u201d\nRishe hadn\u2019t touched a single drop. In fact, she\u2019d been caught up in so many conversations that she hadn\u2019t even had the chance to eat, but she had experience working on an empty stomach. She accepted Arnold\u2019s encouragement as the escape it was.\nJust when I least expect it, he\u2019ll act the gentleman. Maybe he\u2019d remembered her demand for a carefree life of doing nothing.\nRishe cast a charming look across the crowd. \u201cThank you for your consideration, Your Highness. Forgive me.\u201d She gave a polite bow before quietly slipping away. \nShe didn\u2019t head straight to the balcony but rather slowly walked around the hall. There was only so much she could find out glued to Arnold\u2019s side all night.\nI need information. Galkhein\u2019s political landscape was a mystery to me through all my past lives. I only know the rumors that made it abroad.\nAlthough she knew of Arnold\u2019s eventual patricide, she had no concept of the circumstances leading up to it. She needed a better picture of the factions and power balance inside the court. The lives these people led.\nI know better than to believe wartime gossip. This Arnold Hein is a lot different from what I\u2019d heard he was like at nineteen. He\u2019s not as diabolical as the rumors led me to believe. He likes to push, but he isn\u2019t unkind. The thought drifted across her mind, leaving her conflicted. Well, he\u2019s not unkind now. But I still don\u2019t like not knowing his motives. And he\u2019s a bit of a jerk, to be honest. \nShe tried to settle her mind and just observe. Gathering intelligence was necessary to lead a long, carefree life lazing around the palace.\nIf I recall correctly, that\u2019s Lord Hannawald. He seems to be on good terms with Count Gayle. Duke Hudemann and Duke Teinitz are having a friendly enough conversation, yet they don\u2019t seem close. Rishe ticked off the names of people she\u2019d met, committing them to memory.\nA wave of sweet perfume wafted over her. A pretty girl with soft blonde hair had appeared at her side. \u201cHow do you do, Lady Rishe? I\u2019m Cornelia Thea Toona.\u201d\nDuke Toona\u2019s family was the thirty-first house she\u2019d met tonight.\nRishe smiled graciously. \u201cRishe Irmgard Weitzner. A pleasure to meet you.\u201d\n\u201cThe pleasure is all mine.\u201d Cornelia smiled sweetly. Her eyes were big and bright, her lips full. She held a glass in each hand and offered one to Rishe. \u201cWine? I see you\u2019re empty-handed.\u201d\nA gaggle of other ladies nearby began giggling among themselves.\n\u201cHow dare she act so haughty when she\u2019s a captive. It\u2019s time for her learn just what she is. A pawn to be played and discarded.\u201d\n\u201cShe should enjoy her time on Prince Arnold\u2019s arm while she can.\u201d\n\u201cShe is from a minor nation, after all.\u201d\nAs Rishe took note of their whispers, Cornelia gazed at her with doe eyes. \u201cDoes my offering offend you in some way?\u201d\nIf I remember correctly, House Toona holds a vast territory in southern Galkhein.\nRishe held out a hand to accept the glass. \u201cHow could it? Thank you, Lady Cornelia.\u201d\nBefore Rishe could touch the glass, Cornelia gave a dramatic shout. \u201cOh dear! My hand slipped!\u201d She dropped it, quite obviously on purpose. Without thinking, Rishe grabbed her skirts and leaned back, plucking the glass out of the air with the other hand.\nCornelia let out a cry of surprise as Rishe caught the wine before any could spill. She swirled the glass and brought it to her nose to breathe in the bouquet.\nHmm\u2026 That\u2019s mashed capsicum. Where did she even get that? What a waste of perfectly good wine. And why bother spicing it enough to singe the tongue if she just planned to ruin my dress? Pick a plan, my dear.\nHiding her exasperation, Rishe smiled brightly. \u201cI\u2019ve never had a wine quite like this. What an unusual scent.\u201d\nCornelia bit her lip in frustration. Rishe beamed at her. You\u2019ve got such a pretty face, Lady Toona. Why don\u2019t you smile?\nRishe leaned in close to Cornelia. \u201cThis vintage isn\u2019t available where I\u2019m from. I\u2019m ever so anxious to learn more. Should I perhaps invite Prince Arnold over to enjoy a glass? Which tray did you get this from?\u201d\n\u201cWhat? Oh, um\u2026\u201d Rishe had a policy of never backing down from a fight, but it seemed Cornelia didn\u2019t share it. \u201cS-sorry, but I don\u2019t remember. Such a large hall, you see.\u201d\n\u201cA shame. I\u2019ll just give His Highness this one, then. I\u2019ll be sure to let him know who it\u2019s from.\u201d\n\u201cUh, wait!\u201d Cornelia rapidly shook her head. \u201cI-I got that glass for you, so I think you should\u2014you know what? Never mind! Maybe I should just take that\u2014oh no!\u201d\nRishe ignored the ashen-faced Cornelia, raising the glass and swallowing down a gulp. \n\u201cI-I can\u2019t believe\u2026\u201d\n\u201cSuch a spicy flavor, just as I imagined.\u201d Rishe smiled again to the assembled group\u2019s astonishment. \u201cWhat a warm welcome. I do hope the two of us can spend more time together. Perhaps\u2026a tea party?\u201d\n\u201cTh-the two of us?\u201d Cornelia stammered.\n\u201cYes. I want to know all about House Toona.\u201d\nCornelia looked flabbergasted, but she recovered herself and nodded.\nThat should do. One of Rishe\u2019s eventual plans required a plot of land in a temperate climate. House Toona\u2019s would likely be perfect, but she needed to confirm a few things with Cornelia. Never back down from a fight. Even further\u2026\nShe recalled the words of her mentor from her days as a merchant.\nDon\u2019t bother with fights you can\u2019t win.\nThe other ladies fled, fearful of this strange girl who gulped down painfully spicy wine like it was nothing. \n \n***\n \nRishe retreated to the empty balcony to enjoy the music, grimacing with every stinging mouthful of wine. She drank it in decreasing sips until Arnold joined her.\n\u201cWhat are you making that face for?\u201d\nRishe swirled the glass. \u201cDon\u2019t worry, it\u2019s not you. It\u2019s just this wine is so spicy.\u201d\n\u201cSpicy? The wine is?\u201d\n\u201cMm. It\u2019s seasoned with capsicum. I barely managed to get that first mouthful down without gagging.\u201d\nArnold swiped the glass from her hand. \u201cDon\u2019t tell me this was a poisoning attempt!\u201d\nRishe clicked her tongue in annoyance at her own lack of vigilance. No one else would be able to grab something from her so easily.\nArnold glared at the wine. \u201cYou don\u2019t need to drink this. I\u2019ll get rid of it.\u201d\n\u201cHey, give that back! They ruined a perfectly good glass of wine because of me. I\u2019m not going to waste it.\u201d She grabbed it back and took another sip, shuddering at the taste.\nArnold glowered. \u201cTell me who did this. I\u2019ll have them executed.\u201d\n\u201cDon\u2019t be ridiculous. You don\u2019t kill people like her\u2014you use them.\u201d Just the tiniest bit of wine to go, but it was getting harder to make herself drink it. She gave the glass a reproachful look, then glanced back at Arnold. \u201cOh, and I owe you an apology.\u201d\n\u201cDo you?\u201d\n\u201cI used your name to defend myself.\u201d The girls had only backed off when she threatened to tattle to Arnold. Rishe found that sort of thing inelegant in the extreme, and she was embarrassed.\nArnold sighed at Rishe\u2019s apologetic bow. \u201cThere\u2019s nothing wrong with a wife invoking her husband\u2019s name.\u201d\nRishe hesitated. \u201cWe\u2019re not married yet.\u201d\n\u201cThat\u2019s a formality. It\u2019s as good as done, if you ask me.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2026see.\u201d\nHe took her distraction as an opportunity to swipe her glass back. Instead of dumping it out, Arnold gulped the rest of it down. \n\u201cDamn, that packs a punch,\u201d he grumbled.\n\u201cI told you that!\u201d Rishe snapped. \u201cAre you all right? Let me get you some water!\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m fine. But now you\u2019ve fulfilled your obligation to the wine, haven\u2019t you?\u201d\nRishe didn\u2019t know what to say. He\u2019d helped her\u2014not by taking charge but by following her lead. Without cutting her down and telling her she was being foolish. Without rolling his eyes and dismissing her desires as trifles.\n\u201cThank you,\u201d Rishe said stiffly, which just made him laugh.\n\u201cWhat were you thinking about when we were dancing?\u201d he asked.\n\u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d\n\u201cYou were thinking about someone else, weren\u2019t you? Who?\u201d\nRishe didn\u2019t know a delicate way to say I was thinking about a future version of you I met in another life.\n\u201cHmm?\u201d His tone was oddly light, teasing even. But the gleam in his hunter\u2019s eyes said she wouldn\u2019t get away so easily.\nObviously, Rishe couldn\u2019t give him an honest answer. \u201cI wasn\u2019t thinking about anyone else. I was worried about you.\u201d\n\u201cWhy?\u201d\nThis was the closest she could come to the truth. \u201cWere you injured here?\u201d She patted her own left shoulder with her forefinger. \nArnold went silent. His left shoulder was slightly slower to react than his right\u2014if his right was at one hundred, then his left was at maybe ninety-eight. It was hardly noticeable, but Rishe had picked up on it. He was right-handed, and she wouldn\u2019t have noticed it if they\u2019d been dancing normally. \nThat, and if it hadn\u2019t been for memories from her past life.\nRishe had only managed to inflict a single injury on him. An instant, a moment\u2019s hesitation where she saw her chance and slashed left. Of course, he\u2019d shrugged off the injury and effortlessly run her through. \n\u201cHeh.\u201d Arnold finally broke his silence with grim laughter. His eyes sent shivers down her spine, cold and bewitching. In lieu of an answer, he reached for his collar, unfastening the clasp with a snap and drawing his",
    "query_text": " jacket open with a rough tug.\nOh my.\nRishe drew in a breath. A great scar was engraved into the nape of his neck, just low enough to be concealed by clothing. It looked several years old. \u201cIt\u2019s an old wound. It continues to the top of my shoulder and pulls the skin taut.\u201d\n\u201cHow awful.\u201d Rishe couldn\u2019t help but reach"

She opened the door to find Oliver standing in the hallway with a polite smile.\nHe apologized again. \u201cThis was the only time I could slip away from His Highness\u2019s office.

    "prefix_text": " satisfied.\n \n***\n \nI\u2019m so glad I managed to finish washing the sheets in time!\nStanding before the maids with Arnold\u2019s attendant Oliver at her side, Rishe was panicking on the inside. She\u2019d had so much to do this morning that she\u2019d put off the laundry to the last minute. She took deep, controlled breaths, praying no one would notice that she\u2019d raced here at a dead sprint.\nOliver was none the wiser as he spoke to the assembled girls. Rishe took the opportunity to look them over. She locked eyes with Elsie, who was gaping at her. It was a nice change\u2014usually her face was as blank as a rock wall.\nI\u2019m sorry for the deception. I figured blending in would give me the best picture of your working conditions.\nThe new maids wore similarly shocked expressions, while others watched her with delight. Meanwhile, the veterans, including Diana, had all gone pale. They trembled, stunned into silence. One seemed locked in a terrifying trance, while another looked on the verge of tears. All of them had spoken to Rishe with derision. As the ringleader, Diana was covering her mouth with both hands, like she was holding in a scream.\nOliver had finished his introduction. \u201cYour Highness, if you would?\u201d\nRishe stepped forward. \u201cFirst, I must apologize to you for what has transpired prior to this meeting. My deception, that is. However, it has granted me insight into how each one of you works.\u201d\nOliver\u2019s face creased in confusion. The newcomer maids began to panic, whispering among themselves.\n\u201cDoesn\u2019t this mean that she helped us out with the laundry?\u201d\n\u201cWe\u2019re going to be fired!\u201d\n\u201cIf I lose my position, my brother will have to quit school!\u201d\nNoticing the commotion, Oliver glanced at Rishe. \u201cYour Highness, two-thirds of these maids are newly recruited from the city. Since the majority of the castle maids were elderly, His Highness assumed you would prefer maids closer in age to yourself.\u201d\nRishe was startled. She had found it odd that most of her potential servants were new hires, but she hadn\u2019t expected this to be the reason.\n\u201cWhile the prince has entrusted the selection of your maids to you,\u201d Oliver went on. \u201cHiring someone with no experience will not do. Despite Prince Arnold\u2019s views, I urge you to reject the newcomers.\u201d\n\u201cOliver.\u201d\n\u201cI have a list of their names here. Elsie\u2014\u201d\n\u201cElsie, Nichole, Hilde, Marguerite, Rosa.\u201d Rishe began listing the names of the newly recruited maids. She\u2019d made a point to memorize them in the washhouse. \u201cElke, Amelia, and\u2014\u201d\nOliver looked at her wildly. \u201cYou know them all?! Even though they\u2019ve never served you in the past?\u201d\n\u201cYes, of course I do. Servants are essential to the maintenance of our lifestyle, why wouldn\u2019t I get to know them?\u201d Rishe listed the remaining names for good measure. \u201cAll twenty of you, listen to me.\u201d \nThe new maids stiffened. Diana and the other maids whose names hadn\u2019t been called were getting their wind back, wearing increasingly triumphant looks.\nRishe said, \u201cThe twenty names I just called will be my maids.\u201d\nTime seemed to stand still a moment, and then Oliver broke in with an astonished, \u201cB-but, my lady! They are all inexperienced\u2014\u201d\n\u201cYes. And my palace will be the perfect place to learn.\u201d\nThe new recruits were completely speechless, unsure of exactly what was happening. \nRishe smiled at Elsie. \u201cI hope you\u2019ll serve me well, Elsie.\u201d\nElsie was still frozen in place. \u201cHuh? Y-yes, my lady, but\u2014\u201d\nA shaking Diana cried out, \u201cBut why, my lady?! You\u2019ve seen their work! They\u2019re useless, the lot of them! The rest of us get so much more done in a shorter amount of time!\u201d\n\u201cWatch your tongue, girl,\u201d Oliver said sharply.\nDiana ignored him. \u201cWe\u2019re hard workers! Any job you assign us, we can do it! Please, I beg you, my lady!\u201d\n\u201cStep back,\u201d Oliver warned. \u201cDo not take a single step closer to Lady Rishe.\u201d\nDiana spoke in a rush, words pouring out of her. \u201cI-I freely admit that I was impolite before, but I didn\u2019t know who she was! I\u2019ll take any punishment, so please, give me the chance to show you how well I can work!\u201d\nRishe said, \u201cDiana, I have a request.\u201d\n\u201cTh-thank you, my lady!\u201d Diana heaved a sigh of relief. \u201cYou mean you\u2019ll\u2014\u201d \nRishe cut across her. \u201cAs of today, you are no longer a maid in this palace.\u201d \n\u201cWhat?\u201d Her face, usually so fixed with determination, paled. \u201cBut why? I\u2019m so much better than any of them! I\u2019ll do a perfect job no matter what task you set before me. Please don\u2019t dismiss me, my lady!\u201d \n\u201cListen to me, Diana.\u201d Rishe dropped her lofty tone, speaking as one woman would to another. \u201cYou have noticed it, haven\u2019t you? No matter what you claim, these new girls aren\u2019t worthless.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2026I don\u2019t understand.\u201d\n\u201cCan you remember your first month in service? How difficult it was?\u201d\nDiana looked completely bewildered. Her gaze darted around as if looking for help.\nPulling herself together, she forced herself to follow Rishe\u2019s directions. She thought back and finally alighted on a response. \u201cI\u2026I didn\u2019t know how to do the job. Before, when my family was still prominent, I\u2019d washed shirts and bedsheets. Never gowns or military uniforms.\u201d\n\u201cPerfectly reasonable,\u201d Rishe said. \u201cOnly natural for someone just starting out.\u201d\n\u201cThe older girls were so busy, they told me to just watch them since they didn\u2019t have time to teach me. When I had questions\u2026well, there was nobody to ask.\u201d\n\u201cI bet. And did you have any other problems?\u201d\n\u201cWell, yes. There was a lot to learn. Different kinds of soap and washboards depending on the cloth. You use different tools for different materials. I had to learn how they worked and how to put them away. I was\u2026punished if I didn\u2019t get it right the first time.\u201d\nThe newcomers were exchanging surprised looks. Rishe understood why.\nEverything Diana said was familiar to them. They spent valuable time searching for their materials and the proper ways to use them, but they shrank from asking for help. Everyone always looked so busy. This was a universal problem.\n\u201cDespite all that, I got better!\u201d Diana protested. \u201cI only needed to be taught once. Unlike them! They\u2019re useless!\u201d\n\u201cYes, well. There\u2019s a difference between you and them,\u201d Rishe told Diana. \u201cYou can read and write.\u201d\n\u201cOh!\u201d Diana started in surprise. Elsie looked at the floor.\nThe literacy rate among commoners was low no matter where you went. Very few families had the means to afford an education, especially for daughters. Diana had been born to a merchant\u2019s family\u2014she\u2019d received formal schooling. The maids she was close friends with were likely from similar backgrounds. The majority of those in service were not so fortunate.\n\u201cWhat if you only received instructions on how to do a job once and weren\u2019t able to write it down to remind yourself later?\u201d Rishe asked. \u201cWould you be so confident?\u201d\n\u201cI-I don\u2019t\u2014\u201d Diana reflexively thrust a hand into her apron pocket, where she had a list of daily tasks recorded in her neat handwriting to reference throughout the day. Hopefully now she would understand how much of an edge her privileged literacy gave her over the other maids.\n\u201cEveryone else works as hard as they can, just like you do,\u201d",
    "query_text": " Rishe said. \u201cRemember how it was for you at first? They all have to start somewhere. I hope you\u2019ll keep that in mind.\u201d\n\u201cThey\u2019re no different from me,\u201d Diana mumbled begrudgingly, glancing around the room, looking at the less experienced maids. As if coming to a decision, she said, \u201cI\u2019m sorry.\u201d\n\u201cDiana?\u201d\nLike a child enumerating her regrets, Diana went on, \u201cI\u2019ve done you wrong, all of you. It\u2019s just, I had nothing. Or so it felt like. No money, no"

Her hair was covered in leaves. \nI need to hurry up!\nBracing against a nearby rock, she used her weight to snap the heels off of her shoes. There. That would make running a little easier. Satisfied, she slipped them back on and made haste toward the family estate. \n \n***\n \nUp on the balcony, Crown Prince Arnold of Galkhein watched the spectacle play out from beginning to end. He gazed at the girl with the coral hair. Her appearance was that of any young noblewoman, but she moved like a well-trained knight. She\u2019d leapt from the balcony and landed skillfully, showing no signs of distress at her ripped dress or disheveled hair. Instead, she\u2019d knocked the heels off her shoes and dashed away.\nAlso, she had called him an emperor.\nPlaying it all over again in his head, Arnold broke out into a rare chuckle. As his shoulders quivered with laughter, his attendant approached him from behind.\n\u201cThere you are, Your Highness. What are you doing out here? I\u2019m aware you don\u2019t desire a wife, but beginning the search would be wise\u2026 Er, Your Highness?\u201d The attendant\u2019s eyes flew wide. His bored and scowling master was laughing. \u201cDid something happen?\u201d\n\u201cOliver, ready my coach. Wait, no. That will take too much time. Bring me a horse.\u201d\n\u201cAt once, Your Highness. Might I ask why?\u201d\nArnold didn\u2019t respond\u2014he just grinned like a hungry wolf catching scent of his prey.\n \n***\n \nOnce outside the palace gates, Rishe threw herself into the waiting coach, shouting for the driver to make haste. She stopped it a few hundred yards from the manor and bid him farewell. \u201cI\u2019m leaving! Thanks for always being such a safe driver, Daniel!\u201d\nThe road to the manor was muddy from a morning rain shower. She knew from her second life that the coach would get stuck, resulting in a loss of valuable time. It was better to just get out and run. \n\u201cHuff, huff.\u201d Despite her last life\u2019s physical conditioning, this body had no stamina. She\u2019d need to try to get fitter faster this time around.\nRishe reached the end of the road, and her heart promptly sank all the way to her feet. \u201cOh no.\u201d\nThe front door was thronged with people, all of them surrounding a carriage bearing the royal family\u2019s coat of arms.\nI need to get out of here.\nWhile she stood frozen in indecision, one of the knights doing crowd control shouted, \u201cYour Highness! I have eyes on Lady Rishe!\u201d\n\u201cGet out of my way!\u201d A familiar voice started up a bellow. \u201cLet me through! Rishe, how dare you make me wait so long?\u201d\nRishe\u2019s ex-fianc\u00e9, Crown Prince Dietrich, stepped triumphantly forward.\n\u201cI know the thought of hearing your crimes enumerated by the man you love must pain you, but alas, as future king, it is my duty to bring down the hammer of justice upon a villainess such as yourself!\u201d\n\u201cI see I\u2019ve timed it badly,\u201d Rishe muttered. \u201cIn fact, this is my worst loop yet. I\u2019d rather be barred from the house than see you again.\u201d\n\u201cHmm? What are you grumbling about?\u201d Dietrich looked Rishe up and down. \u201cI knew it. You put on a brave face, but I can sense the sorrow in your heart.\u201d\n\u201cI beg your pardon?\u201d\n\u201cYour heart!\u201d the prince repeated. \u201cYour heart! It must be absolutely crushed! Because I called off our engagement!\u201d\nRishe wasn\u2019t sure where he was drawing these conclusions from. Possibly the same place he mined for all his bottomless self-confidence.\n\u201cI can tell you\u2019ve been wandering aimlessly, distraught,\u201d the prince went on. \u201cLook at you. Your dress is caked in mud, your shoes are broken, and there are cuts marring your face and arms. What other possible cause could there be than heartbreak?\u201d\nRishe narrowed her eyes. \u201cDo you ever stop to think about the words coming out of your mouth?\u201d\n\u201cWhat?\u201d\nHis interpretation of events was fanciful to the point of absurdity. \u201cI did not dirty my dress or snap my shoes out of heartbreak. Because I feel none. You\u2019ve always been a little slow, so I\u2019ll make this clear: I do not have a single shred of fondness for you, or for our broken engagement.\u201d\n\u201cWhat?!\u201d the prince said. \u201cWhat are you saying?!\u201d\nThe surrounding crowd began to snicker.\n\u201cIsn\u2019t that the crown prince? Did Lady Rishe just dump him?\u201d\n\u201cWait, but wasn\u2019t he trying to dump her?\u201d\n\u201cCan\u2019t be! Look at her! She doesn\u2019t care at all!\u201d\n\u201cHow dare you nobodies make sport of me?\u201d Dietrich screeched. \u201cI am your prince!\u201d\nTemper aside, Dietrich was a handsome man. He had azure-blue eyes and blond hair\u2014a prince straight out of a picture book. His looks and place in the succession meant a never-ending swarm of women vying for his affections. He was brought up a pampered princeling, never wanting for anything. It manifested in a pompous manner and an overconfidence in his own abilities. Rishe had cautioned him about his attitude before, but he never paid her any mind.\nI\u2019m so glad I don\u2019t have to marry him.\nShe wished she could go back and tell the shocked, scared girl from her first life not to worry about her shattered engagement. Still, she might as well say it all here and now, with the assembled knights and citizens to bear witness.\n\u201cYour Highness, you exist to love and protect your people. It\u2019s unbecoming to speak of them in this manner.\u201d\n\u201cYou\u2019re the unbecoming one!\u201d the prince snapped. \u201cBeg me for forgiveness!\u201d\n\u201cI won\u2019t. Calling off our betrothal is the best course, and I applaud Your Highness for your good sense.\u201d\nNow even the knights were trembling with suppressed mirth. \nDietrich was turning red. \u201cD-don\u2019t laugh at me!\u201d\n\u201cLady Rishe,\u201d came a sweet voice. \u201cAren\u2019t you ashamed of yourself?\u201d \nRishe fought down a groan.\nOut of the crowd stepped a charming, dainty girl. Her big eyes moist with tears, she took her place at Dietrich\u2019s side. \u201cI do not allow the people I care about to be treated so very ill!\u201d \n\u201cWhy, Lady Mary. You\u2019re here.\u201d Rishe sighed. \u201cHow nice.\u201d\nThe young Mary scowled through her tears. Hidden behind her skirts, Dietrich continued to shout his disapproval. \u201cRishe! You\u2019ve brought my beloved Mary to tears! She\u2019s told me everything. How you bullied her, ridiculed her. How you find it amusing to lock her in the classroom overnight! Such a wicked woman could never be queen!\u201d\nNone of that\u2019s true.\nRishe glanced at Mary, who averted her gaze a little awkwardly.\n\u201cMore importantly,\u201d Rishe said, \u201chave you already brought your concerns to my parents, Your Highness?\u201d\n\u201cMore importantly?! I did, if you must know! Your parents are furious. They have vowed to disown you.\u201d\n\u201cAh. Then I\u2019m too late.\u201d Her parents held their reputation above all else. Rishe had little hope of retrieving any of her money or belongings now.\n\u201cWhy are you acting so strangely?\u201d Dietrich sniffed. \u201cAh, I understand. You\u2019re in such shock from this turn of events that\u2014\u201d\n\u201cListen, Dietrich.\u201d In her exasperation, Rishe dropped his title. \u201cI accept your decree. We are no longer engaged. I shall never darken your doorstep again. So\u2026relax a little.\u201d\n\u201cHuh? What are you saying?\u201d\n\u201cSince I was a child, I believed that my only value was in our betrothal. Being engaged to the crown prince was my whole reason for living. I was wrong about that. Only I determine my value\u2014no one else. That\u2019s why I don\u2019t care about this. I\u2019m beyond it.\u201d Rishe made sure to look him directly in the eye as she spoke. \u201cYou are an unnecessary element in my life.\u201d\nDietrich staggered back. His legs seemed to go out from under him, and he crumpled. At that, the knights finally let go of their composure, laughing along with the courtiers.\n\u201cSt-stop!\u201d the prince wailed. \u201cYou are my subjects. This\u2026this shows such flagrant disrespect!\u201d\n\u201cDietrich, don\u2019t pay them any mind,\u201d Lady Mary said. \u201cLady Rishe, is this cruelty necessary?\u201d\n\u201cPerhaps this is a blessing in disguise.\u201d Rishe\u2019s attention moved to Mary, making the girl\u2019s slender shoulders jump. She had no reason to worry; Rishe didn\u2019t bite. \u201cI\u2019ve been wanting the opportunity to speak to you, Lady Mary. You\u2019re strong. I admire you very much.\u201d\n\u201cWhat are you talking about?\u201d\n\u201cYou\u2019re a lovely girl who never fails to smile despite your troubles. You don\u2019t put up walls around your heart, and you do your utmost to put others at ease. Even now, you bravely stand before me to protect the prince.\u201d\nMary\u2019s eyes were wide with confusion. Rishe picked her words carefully, attempting to diminish the girl\u2019s guilty feelings, if only a little. \u201cYou need to marry the prince for your family\u2019s sake, right?\u201d\n\u201cHow do you\u2014?\u201d\nRishe had learned this truth in one of her past lives. Mary was born to a poor",
    "query_text": " family, and she had studied like mad to be accepted into the academy to hunt for a husband. She intended to make sure neither she nor her brothers ever went hungry again.\nShe went on, \u201cRemember this: you are the one in control of your life. Don\u2019t sell it to anyone else. Can you trust a man who so easily discards the woman he\u2019s been engaged to since childhood? Do you truly believe he cares for you?\u201d\nAstonishment bloomed across Mary\u2019s face. She looked over at Dietrich, who hadn\u2019t bothered to stand up. The truth was\u2026within a year, Prince Dietrich would be in prison, his title stripped from him. He would plan a mad coup d\u2019\u00e9tat against the king"

His own private jokes.\n\u201cAre you\u2026unhappy with him?\u201d Oliver ventured. \u201cWith his looks, His Highness is exceedingly popular with the ladies of the court, you know.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m sure he has many admirers.\u201d She paused. \u201cWould you really call the way he acts around me \u2018happy\u2019?

I wonder, what will the emperor think when he learns of his son\u2019s slighting at your nation\u2019s hands?\u201d\n\u201cIf you would, Lady Rishe?\u201d The plump king looked to be on the verge of tears.\nRishe had no obligation to accept and no desire to spend a moment longer in this country than was absolutely necessary. But acquiescence seemed the fastest way to move things along.\nAs her mind whirled, Arnold leaned in to whisper, \u201cIf you refuse to hear my suit, you won\u2019t deter me. I\u2019ll simply move on to Plan B.\u201d\nAnd that was how she found herself in one of the palace\u2019s parlors, here to \u201cjust talk\u201d to Prince Arnold. The ball guests were all gone. It was just the two of them.\n\u201cI want to know what you\u2019re planning,\u201d Rishe said flatly.\n\u201cPlanning? Me?\u201d\n\u201cBy asking me to marry you. You don\u2019t know me. A proposal like this wouldn\u2019t come out of the blue.\u201d\nThis man was destined to become an aggressive warmonger over the next few years. He wouldn\u2019t do anything without a dozen motives.\nPrince Arnold just smiled. \u201cI have no plans. I\u2019m simply enamored with you.\u201d\n\u201cEnamored\u2026?\u201d\nThat was the last thing she\u2019d expected him to say. Asking him to elaborate didn\u2019t seem worth the breath\u2014he was obviously lying. As if this ruthless, inhuman creature with ice in his veins could feel even a flicker of affection.\n\u201cWhy refuse me?\u201d Arnold asked. \u201cYour engagement is broken, you\u2019re on the verge of exile, and you have no faction or supporters. At this rate, you\u2019ll be dead within a fortnight. I\u2019d call my offer a stroke of unbelievable fortune.\u201d\n\u201cYou\u2019re not wrong,\u201d Rishe admitted. \u201cOnce upon a time, I would have jumped at your offer.\u201d\nIf it had been made in her first life, for instance. But now Rishe knew better. Her life was only just getting started, and the future held endless possibilities. After the horror of her sixth loop, she yearned for freedom.\nI don\u2019t want to marry him. I won\u2019t be anyone\u2019s captive. Still\u2026\nRishe, more than anyone, knew that the slightest adjustment could enact profound changes on the trajectory of a life. No doubt she\u2019d have many more lives, but this could be the only one where marriage to Arnold would be an option.\nThe dread emperor. The tyrant. The man who will stoke the fires of war. \nRishe knew the gossip, the endless conjecture behind Arnold Hein\u2019s bloody reign, but she didn\u2019t know the truth.\nWhy? The question had haunted her since her first life. She\u2019d never before had the chance to even speak to him.\nShe had wondered it as a merchant, hearing of the distant outbreak of war. She\u2019d wondered when the news of the dead and dying reached her apothecary. When she had comforted her terrified mistress in her life as a maid, assuring her everything would be all right. When she squared off against him in battle, as he plunged a sword through her heart\u2014even then she wondered. \nIf I stick around, maybe I\u2019ll finally have my answer. Half of her was dying to know. The other half didn\u2019t give a damn. And yet\u2026\nShe recalled a childhood dream. Rather, a longing.\nRishe let out a breath. \u201cYou claim you are enamored with me.\u201d\n\u201cYes. I am completely under your spell.\u201d\nTo think he could spout such nonsense with a straight face!\n\u201cThen will you grant me anything I desire?\u201d\n\u201cSo long as it is within my power,\u201d Arnold said. \u201cAnything you want will be yours.\u201d\nRishe hesitated, gathering her thoughts. \u201cI have some conditions.\u201d Arnold silently motioned for her to go on. \u201cI want full control over the wedding festivities. Everything must be procured through merchants of my choosing.\u201d\n\u201cFine.\u201d Arnold nodded. \u201cYou\u2019re free to do business with whomever you wish.\u201d\n\u201cAfter we are married, I must be in a position to mingle with guests from abroad.\u201d\n\u201cThat sounds within the purview of the crown princess. Anything else?\u201d\n\u201cI will be allowed to live in a separate residence from your mother and father.\u201d\nShe meant this seriously, but it made Arnold laugh. \u201cYou don\u2019t seem the type to worry about an overbearing mother-in-law.\u201d\n\u201cYou would be surprised. Combative relationships with one\u2019s new family are the most difficult part of marriage, or so they say. It could be a ramshackle cottage for all I care\u2014I just require a secondary residence.\u201d\nActually, Rishe didn\u2019t care at all about in-laws. When Arnold set his war into motion, his first move would be the assassination of his father. A genuine coup by patricide, not at all like Dietrich\u2019s clumsy attempt. Next, he would name himself emperor, take control of the country, and mobilize the military.\nSeparating him from his parents will make the first step more difficult\u2014although not impossible, unfortunately.\n\u201cAnything else?\u201d Arnold asked. \u201cI\u2019ll do whatever it takes to marry you.\u201d\n\u201cIdeally, I\u2019d like to know your endgame,\u201d Rishe said with dignity. \u201cBut as I doubt there\u2019s any chance of that, I have one final request.\u201d She jabbed a finger into his face, regardless of how rude it was. \u201cI will spend my time idling around the castle. No work, no study. I shall be utterly useless.\u201d\nLet\u2019s see just how much you want me as your princess.\nAfter a long moment of silence, Arnold cracked a merry laugh. The proposal remained; all her conditions were met.\n\n(2) chapter number given is likely out of range: 0\nChapter: 7\n\nChapter 2\nChapter 2\n \n\u201cYOU KNOW, it was only after I went into commerce that I truly had a dream for the future,\u201d Rishe had once confided in a friend. \u201cUp until then, I existed only as the crown prince\u2019s fianc\u00e9e or my father\u2019s daughter. My every act was to become more worthy of that status. But now, for the first time, I actually have a goal of my own.\u201d\n\u201cOh, yeah?\u201d her friend said. He was the ruler of the desert kingdom, and his smile was awfully charming. \u201cWhat\u2019s that?\u201d\nRishe smiled back. \u201cI want to travel to every single country in the world. I want to see everything in every town, peruse their markets, and meet the eyes of every person who lives there!\u201d\nBy now, that felt like such a distant dream.\n \n***\n \nRishe awoke with a start, eyes snapping open as she sensed a disturbance in the air.\nShe unsheathed her sword halfway, primed for danger. \nInside the coach, her old enemy sat across from her, one hand outstretched. \u201cWhat do you think you\u2019re doing?\u201d she demanded.\nWhen they\u2019d boarded the coach, Rishe had warned him not to lay a single finger on her throughout the trip to his kingdom. Ordering the prince not to touch his consort was absurd, but Arnold readily agreed. He had, after all, promised to follow her every direction.\nAnd yet, here he was, already breaking his promise.\nArnold appeared unperturbed by her glare. \u201cDon\u2019t look at me like that. I was merely trying to recover what you took from me.\u201d\nConfused, Rishe looked at the sword in her hand. It had a black lacquered scabbard with a simple golden decoration. Engraved on the hilt was the Galkhein crest.\n\u201cOh!\u201d Rishe thrust the sword back at Arnold. \u201cMy apologies.\u201d\nArnold chuckled. \u201cYou caught me off guard. You were nodding off, and then you suddenly snatched up my sword. You looked quite content snuggling up with it.\u201d\nArnold propped the sword beside him. Rishe pressed a hand to her chest to quell her racing heart. The sword that gutted me in my previous life is now my bedmate. What a world. Her recent stint as a knight had left her ill at ease without a blade at hand. She just couldn\u2019t believe it was Arnold\u2019s she\u2019d reached for.\n\u201cI didn\u2019t mean to disturb you, but I doubted sleeping with a weapon would be comfortable. I\u2019m impressed you sensed my intent before I even touched you.\u201d Arnold rested one elbow against the window frame, watching her with shameless fascination. \u201cOne only develops instincts like that from combat training. And you were also a member of the court? How in the world did you find the time?\u201d\nRishe shrugged. She couldn\u2019t just say, I pretended to be a man in a previous life, that\u2019s how.\n\u201cI assume there\u2019s more to you than your devotion to the sword. You seem to like flowers.\u201d\nShe followed Arnold\u2019s gaze to where she\u2019d bundled a small bouquet in a handkerchief. This was their fifth day on the road to Galkhein. Every day, without fail, she\u2019d picked flowers whenever they stopped to water the horses. The ones from today were still fresh, but the ones she\u2019d begun drying five days ago were just about ready.\n\u201cI didn\u2019t pick these because they\u2019re pretty.\u201d Rishe brought the blooms to her face, spirits rising at their sweet scent. Spring wildflowers had a soft and gentle smell. Rishe looked out the window at the forest spreading toward Galkhein, thinking of the rare native flowers going into bloom. She wished she could pick those as well, but that would cause too much delay. She gazed on wistfully.\nAfter watching her in silence for some time, Arnold said, \u201cBy the way, I sent one of my men ahead on a fast horse to deliver your order to the company you requested. They\u2019ll be invited to Galkhein to discuss the wedding ceremony.\u201d\n\u201cThank you,\u201d Rishe said. \u201cI\u2019m glad you kept your word.\u201d\n\u201cThe Aria Trading Company,\u201d Arnold mused. \u201cI\u2019ve heard of them. They\u2019re up-and-comers, aren\u2019t they? Have you done business with them before?\u201d\n\u201cNo, but I heard from a friend that they hold a very high standard of quality.\u201d\nRishe was pleasantly surprised at how easily Arnold had acceded to her request. Typically, a royal household had their own personal dealer. Getting them to do business with someone else could be difficult.\nI want to establish a connection with Aria as soon as possible, Rishe thought. It was, of course, the company that had taken her in during her first life.\nThe company had been established just two years prior to picking her up by its owner, a man named Tully. They were still in their growth stage, but in just a few years, they would be the grandest trading company in all the world. They\u2019d proven a great boon in her life as an apothecary as well, helping to distribute her newest medicines. She\u2019d struggled to win their trust initially, but she pledged to work much harder this time around.\nThis marriage isn\u2019t going to happen\u2014I need an escape plan for when it all falls apart. I must bring to bear all my knowledge and influence as a crown princess.\nRishe didn\u2019t know Arnold\u2019s plans, but she had no intention of sitting around and waiting for him to use her as he pleased. She\u2019d spend her time as his consort wisely. Everything must serve her ultimate goal: to live longer than five years, and live well.\nHer fierce determination must have shown on her face because Arnold gave her a little bemused smile. \u201cYes?\u201d\nGod! Rishe grimaced at that flawlessly handsome countenance. Such beauty, possessed by such powerful destruction. The fact that he\u2019d been the man to kill her did nothing to lessen her fascination. In fact, it almost made it worse. The study of contrasts.\n\u201cSorry, I just\u2014\u201d\nShe was interrupted by the horses\u2019 loud whinnies.\n\u201cStop! Hey, stop the coach!\u201d\nShouts drifted back from conveyance ahead of theirs, which contained the luggage and attendants. The squadron of knights tailing the column of coaches sped off toward the front.\n\u201cWho do you think you\u2014graaargh!\u201d\nThat didn\u2019t sound good. Rishe moved to climb out, but Arnold was faster. He drew his sword.\n\u201cHey!\u201d\nArnold locked the door from the outside. \u201cStay hidden.\u201d\nWhy is he putting himself in danger? That\u2019s what knights are for! The fact that Rishe had been about to do the same thing didn\u2019t occur to her. It\u2019s probably bandits. He told me to stay hidden in here, but I\u2019m not so sure about that.\nArnold had left her locked in from the outside, hoping to keep her safe, but Rishe didn\u2019t like her odds. There were five coaches, but this one was certainly the grandest. It locked on the inside as well, but that wouldn\u2019t stop someone with enough determination. If she did as she was told, she\u2019d just be waiting patiently for a bandit to break a window and drag her out.\nKeeping one eye on the coachmen fleeing into the forest, Rishe began a methodical search for something to help her. Right\u2014her hairpin!\nThis sure brings me back. She unfastened it, twisting it into the gap in the door. Back when I was a maid, my lady would lock herself in her chambers all the time to avoid her studies. I had to break her out just like this.\nThe lock on the coach was simple, and it came open easily. Once she was free, she scanned her surroundings. She didn\u2019t see anyone who looked immediately hostile, but there was noise up ahead. Cautiously, she headed toward it.\nBefore long, she found Arnold.\nWow.\nRoughly ten men\u2014the bandits, she presumed\u2014lay crumpled on the ground. In their midst stood Arnold, in the process of tripping another man into the dirt. He scowled, blade at the man\u2019s throat. \u201cIs that it, then?\u201d\n\u201cGwugh!\u201d\nArnold kicked the bandit in the stomach, eyes blazing with cruelty. \u201cThat\u2019s all the thrill you offer me after I went to the trouble of drawing my sword? Barely worth it. I\u2019m bored already.\u201d\nHe wasn\u2019t angry; on the contrary, he stared his enemies down with chilly disappointment, as if this had all been a letdown. Even Arnold\u2019s own knights seemed terrified of their master when he was in a mood. Arnold smoothly flicked the blood off his sword, wiping the blade on the bandit\u2019s shirt before sheathing it. The rest of the men on the ground seemed to be unconscious.\nWait, he didn\u2019t kill anyone? Why not? Is it because we haven\u2019t reached Galkhein?\nShe supposed even Arnold knew better than to go around killing the citizens of other countries. Or perhaps he had yet to become the ruthless monster she knew him as.\nArnold seemed to sense her gaze, turning around with a start. Genuine emotion bloomed on his face, worlds away from the blank mask he wore to face down the bandits. \u201cHow did you get out of the coach?\u201d\nRishe shrugged. \u201cIf I tell you, you\u2019ll be able to prevent me from doing it again.\u201d\nArnold snickered. \u201cYou continue to amaze me.\u201d\nHow can you go from ice-cold to suddenly looking like a normal nineteen-year-old? It\u2019s disconcerting. \nRishe fought down her disquiet as a man alighted from a coach and shouted, \u201cYour Highness! Not again!\u201d He was Oliver, one of the prince\u2019s attendants. He had silver hair and was roughly as tall as Arnold.\n\u201cWhat do you think all these knights are for, decoration? Why do you insist on endangering yourself?\u201d\nRishe had only met Oliver briefly a few days ago, but he didn\u2019t appear to be intimidated by Arnold at all. And, well\u2026he\u2019s not wrong.\nShe feared the menace would return to Arnold\u2019s expression, but he just looked annoyed. \u201cI could tell they were prepared to kill. I\u2019d prefer to take the burden on myself than risk multiple injuries so far afield. And we already have casualties.\u201d\nHe was right. Several injured knights leaned listlessly among the trees. Arnold issued orders to those still able-bodied. \u201cFirst squad, see to the wounded. Second squad, arrest these men.\u201d\n\u201cYes, sir!\u201d\nOliver appeared unsatisfied. \u201cYour Highness, that is a weak justification. I\u2019m overjoyed you\u2019re well, but you must consider Lady Rishe. Perhaps next time we run into a team of murderous brigands, you could allow your consort to remain in the coach.\u201d\n\u201cI told her",
    "query_text": " to remain in the coach!\u201d\nRishe quickly averted her gaze, turning her attention to the wounded knights. They didn\u2019t appear badly injured, yet they all seemed exhausted.\n\u201cExcuse me, can I take a look?\u201d Rishe approached the knight acting as a medic. He looked round, startled by her presence.\n\u201cNonsense, my lady. Don\u2019t trouble yourself, you must have had quite a scare.\u201d\nThis was not unreasonable, but the wariness in his eyes made it clear he wanted her nowhere near his comrade. He isn\u2019t just being polite. He truly is on guard. \nBeside them, an injured knight groaned as another helped him up."

She wrapped them all up in a handkerchief.\nIn the meantime, Arnold dispatched a messenger to this region\u2019s lord, making arrangements to deliver the apprehended bandits. After coordinating with Oliver, he drifted over to Rishe.\n\u201cI see your interest in flowers is mercenary, rather than ornamental,\u201d he said, surveying the heaps of herbs gathered on the bank of the pond. He sat down beside her.\nWhen he didn\u2019t say anything more, Rishe went back to work plucking leaves from plants with valuable stems. The leaves had no medicinal effects, but they did make a decent broth. Slumber mushroom spores were a nuisance unless dried; they were spread out beside her in the sun.\nI wonder, would he be annoyed if I attached herbs to the roof of the coach? That would be unusual adornment for a crown prince\u2019s retinue, but it wouldn\u2019t hurt to ask.\nShe realized, quite suddenly, that Arnold was looking at her. At her hands, specifically. He sat cross-legged with his chin propped on his fist, staring absently, like a kid watching a column of ants march by.\nWhat is so fascinating about herbs?\nTheir eyes met. \u201cAm I bothering you?\u201d he asked.\nRishe shook her head slowly. \u201cNot at all. I was just curious what caught your eye.\u201d\n\u201cNothing specific. I was just thinking how very unusual you are.\u201d He was smiling again. \u201cI\u2019m looking forward to how you\u2019ll surprise me next.\u201d\nLike I\u2019m some sort of rare pet he bought to entertain him. She didn\u2019t like that. Nothing she\u2019d done was at all remarkable\u2014normal tasks performed by a normal person.\n\u201cI didn\u2019t make that antidote for your amusement.\u201d\n\u201cI realize that.\u201d The instigating smile faded from his lips. \u201cYou know, those knights you coerced into taking your home-brewed medicine were all born in the slums.\u201d\n\u201cCoerced? That\u2019s hardly the word I\u2019d use.\u201d\n\u201cGalkhein claims to value merit above all else, but in the end, people are judged by where they came from. Despite this, those men fought their way up from nothing.\u201d\nRishe paused in plucking the seeds from a flower and looked up at Arnold.\n\u201cThe men with the worst cases of the paralysis were all newly assigned. They\u2019ve spent weeks training to ensure this mission was a success. That older knight\u2014the one who bowed to you\u2014sustained an injury protecting the rookies. He cares deeply about his men.\u201d\n\u201cYou seem to care about them too,\u201d Rishe commented.\n\u201cI handpicked them for my retinue.\u201d Arnold clambered to his feet, only to fall into a bow. \u201cAnd you kept them safe. You have my deepest gratitude.\u201d\nRishe found herself at a loss for words. Was this Arnold putting on a mask to hide the monster within? Or was this the real him? She remembered the way he\u2019d looked when he held his blade to the bandit\u2019s throat, like a child poised to break a toy he had grown bored of.\n\u201cDon\u2019t mention it,\u201d Rishe said, uncomfortable. \u201cI knew how to do it, so I did.\u201d\nArnold laughed softly. \u201cBe that as it may, I\u2019d still count a noblewoman who can brew remedies from wildflowers by the side of the road a rare find.\u201d\n\u201cEarlier, when you grabbed my wrist\u2026\u201d Rishe steered the subject away from her incongruous knowledge. \u201cYou broke your promise. You said you wouldn\u2019t touch me.\u201d\n\u201cThat was reflex,\u201d Arnold protested. \u201cI thought you were going to hurt yourself.\u201d\nSuch a simple conversation, so casual. It had Rishe feeling positively peculiar.\n\u201cWhy are your knights so wary around me?\u201d she asked. \n\u201cWary? Oh, they were all at the palace when you broke your first engagement. They\u2019re most likely concerned I\u2019m bringing home a villainous jilt who will lead to my ruin. Something silly like that.\u201d\n\u201cI see.\u201d Apparently, being dumped by a prince called into question one\u2019s herbalist abilities.\n\u201cI\u2019m glad you mentioned it,\u201d Arnold went on, \u201cbecause there may be people in Galkhein who will oppose our union. I will do everything in my power to protect you, but you must bring any insults or threats to me right away.\u201d\n\u201cAre there likely to be many?\u201d\n\u201cIn theory, the crown prince may choose his own wife, but the done thing is, of course, to marry a princess. I assume a duke\u2019s daughter would have at least some ties to the royal family?\u201d\nHe assumed correctly. She was in the family tree, if a rather distant branch.\n\u201cMy father has ordered me to choose a bride from a different kingdom rather than a woman of my own land because\u2014\u201d\n\u201cOne never knows when a hostage will come in handy,\u201d Rishe finished for him.\nGalkhein was an expansionist empire. Currently, peace reigned\u2014but peace was precarious. If Galkhein demanded any of the countries to hand over a princess bride, then none were in a position to refuse. With his daughter in the hands of a foreign power, no king would dare oppose a war that power cared to wage.\n\u201cI sent a message to my father telling him I happened upon a close relation of Hermity\u2019s king\u2014a duke\u2019s daughter who had been recently tossed aside by her fianc\u00e9e,\u201d Arnold said. \u201cI also may have implied I was the reason for your falling out\u2014yours and the prince\u2019s. Why, when I saw a woman so powerful and connected and beloved, I couldn\u2019t help but plunder you.\u201d\n\u201cPlunder me? That\u2019s certainly one way to describe it.\u201d Dietrich had kicked up an almighty fuss, despite being the one who broke the engagement.\n\u201cMy father approves of you because he sees you as a bargaining chip. There will be others who aren\u2019t prepared to accept you so willingly.\u201d\n\u201cIs that so?\u201d Rishe said steadily.\n\u201cNever fear,\u201d Arnold responded. \u201cThey\u2019ll eat their words, every one of them. They will receive you as their crown princess if they value their\u2014\u201d\n\u201cNo, being a hostage is perfect.\u201d \nArnold stared at her. \u201cHm?\u201d\n\u201cAs a hostage, I\u2019ll have no official duties, will I? We can pretend I\u2019m here only under great duress, and there will be no need for my comment on governmental or diplomatic affairs.\u201d\nArnold hesitated. \u201cI suppose not.\u201d\n\u201cExcellent! Then I can live my dream of being utterly useless.\u201d Rishe trembled with delight. The thought of acting as an ambassador had really been weighing on her mind. Being a princess was nonstop work. Having been groomed for the position from an early age, Rishe knew members of the royal family barely even had time to sleep.\nBut prisoners didn\u2019t have places in government.\n\u201cThis is such a weight off my mind,\u201d Rishe admitted. \u201cThank you so much for keeping your promise, Your Highness.\u201d\n\u201cEr, of course.\u201d\n\u201cBut don\u2019t worry, I won\u2019t shirk my duties as wedding planner.\u201d Nearly ready to collapse with relief, Rishe returned to her herbs.\n \n***\n \nAfter the bandit incident, Rishe felt the knights begin to ease a bit in her presence.\nDespite their initial reluctance to accept her help, they continued to report the injured men\u2019s progress and bring any concerns directly to her. In return, they took over gathering herbs from the surrounding countryside on their rest stops.\nShe hadn\u2019t done it for gratitude, but she was nonetheless touched. Gathering medicinal herbs had been second nature ever since her life as an apothecary, and it was foolish to ever turn down loyalty.\nSeveral days after the altercation with the bandits, the coach train finally arrived in the imperial capital of Galkhein.\n\u201cOh my,\u201d Rishe murmured as they passed through the gates.\nWhite stone buildings stood in straight rows, lining clean, orderly streets. The first stories all appeared to be shops, while the second-floor windows were festooned with flowers. Everywhere she looked were smiling faces, citizens turned out to witness their prince\u2019s return over the smooth brick roads. Overlooking it all was the towering magnificence of the imperial palace.\n\u201cThe capital is the seat of power in Galkhein,\u201d Arnold explained. \u201cSeveral key trade routes converge here.\u201d\nRishe nodded, suddenly anxious to be out of the coach. More and more people were gathering to watch their progress, some carrying shopping bags in both arms or holding hands with children. Many of them waved, as if greeting someone dear to them.\nHappy citizens and clean, orderly streets meant wealth. Galkhein was well-off. Rishe couldn\u2019t help but grin at an adorable little girl watching them roll by with sparkling eyes. When she saw Rishe\u2019s smile, she blushed and leapt up in the air, laughing with delight.\nThe coach made its way through the city before passing through the castle gates. Lines of disciplined knights flanked the road, ready to greet the crown prince and his fianc\u00e9e.\nArnold stepped out of the coach, holding out his hand to Rishe. She took it reflexively as she alighted. A prince would be expected to help any lady out of carriage, never mind his own consort, yet for some reason the knights looked a bit disturbed.\nRishe shot them back of look of innocent confusion.\n\u201cOur long journey is at last at its end, Your Highness, Lady Rishe.\u201d Oliver emerged from the ranks of the knights, bowing. He shot Arnold a curious glance. \u201cHow novel to see you taking the hand of your fianc\u00e9e.\u201d\nAh! Rishe realized that she herself had willingly broken the condition that she had imposed. Arnold had offered his hand, but she was the one who accepted.\nArnold gave a little laugh of triumph. Rishe felt a rush of frustration at being tricked. \nOliver stared at them before leaning in to whisper in Arnold\u2019s ear. Arnold let out a breath of annoyance. \n\u201cIs something the matter?\u201d Rishe asked.\n\u201cI sent orders ahead to have a detached wing of the palace prepared for us, but it seems the preparations are behind schedule. I\u2019m sorry, but you\u2019ll need to stay in a guest room in the main palace for a few days.\u201d\n\u201cOh, I don\u2019t mind if the wing isn\u2019t ready,\u201d Rishe said. \u201cWe can head over there now.\u201d\n\u201cIt hasn\u2019t been used in quite a while. It\u2019ll be covered in dust.\u201d\n\u201cI said that I didn\u2019t mind if it was a mess, remember? But there\u2019s no need for you to put yourself out. By all means, stay in the main palace for as long as you need.\u201d Rishe had spent a life as a maid\u2014dust didn\u2019t scare her. \u201cBesides, I\u2019m a hostage, after all.\u201d\n\u201cYou could at least attempt to sound distressed,\u201d Arnold said with the slightest trace of petulance. \nRishe, who had a huge grin spreading over her face and her chest puffed out with pride, didn\u2019t respond.\n \n***\n \nThe detached wing turned out to be just a separate palace in the distant corner of the grounds\u2014a scant four stories tall and, as advertised, absolutely swimming in dust.\nNot so bad, though. Rishe had pictured decay and clutter, but it was mostly just bare. Bare and musty, but not rotten or falling apart.\n\u201cYou can do whatever you want with this place. I\u2019ll be occupied over the next few days, but feel free to use the guest apartments in the main palace if you get tired of choking to death,\u201d Arnold said before he left.\nAccording to Oliver, work had piled up while the prince was away, and it wasn\u2019t just a few things that could be dispensed with over a few days working around the clock.\nEmperor Arnold Hein\u2026 He\u2019s just a crown prince right now, but I still wish I knew what\u2019s going on in his head. For now, I\u2019ll just focus on what I can do. Like make this place livable.\nShe changed into her plainest dress and rolled up her sleeves. The knights who\u2019d remained to serve as her guard kept watch over her as she went from window to window, throwing them all open.\nIn a stroke of luck, the weather was good, and the detached wing was well placed to soak up the sun. The lack of any creature comforts made it look ascetic and drab, but once it was furnished, Rishe had no doubt it would be lovely.\nLeaving the top floors to air out, Rishe found the stairs to the basement. She pushed the heavy wooden doors open, and mice skittered over her feet. The knights yelped as Rishe descended into the darkness.\n\u201cL",
    "query_text": "-Lady Rishe, why are you going down here?\u201d\n\u201cCleaning supplies are usually kept in the basement. See?\u201d\nThe knights followed her gaze to a duster, broom, dustpan, and pile of fresh cloths. She filled a bucket with water and went to work, rolling up a handkerchief to cover her mouth as she swept dust down from high on the walls. Then she swept up all the dust on the floor.\nIt\u2019s always satisfying to tackle a place this filthy.\nShe corralled the dust bunnies until they were piled up like snow in the center of the hall, and then she swept them out the open door. Once the floors were free of debris"

He told me to stay hidden in here, but I\u2019m not so sure about that.\nArnold had left her locked in from the outside, hoping to keep her safe, but Rishe didn\u2019t like her odds. There were five coaches, but this one was certainly the grandest. It locked on the inside as well, but that wouldn\u2019t stop someone with enough determination. If she did as she was told, she\u2019d just be waiting patiently for a bandit to break a window and drag her out.\nKeeping one eye on the coachmen fleeing into the forest, Rishe began a methodical search for something"

As a woman, Rishe could not inherit her father\u2019s title. Her only value was in her marriage. \nDespite knowing now that the opinions of others were as worthless as empty titles, the words still echoed in her memories.\nRishe\u2019s fingertips twitched, and she opened her eyes. Unmoving, she said, \u201cShouldn\u2019t you be seeing to your duties?\u201d\n\u201cMore hidden depths, I see,\u201d came a voice tinged with pleasure. Rishe straightened and turned. There was Arnold, leaning against the door to the balcony. \u201cYou seem able to sense my approach no matter how far or how hard I try.\u201d\n\u201cYou\u2019re quite naughty, aren\u2019t you? You\u2019ve been making your presence known little by little, emanating threat, to see how quickly I catch on.\u201d\n\u201cSo you noticed that as well.\u201d Arnold joined Rishe on the balcony. She tensed, but all he did was cast a curious glance at the view. \u201cWhat were you looking at?\u201d\n\u201cThe city.\u201d Rishe was hardly going to tell him she\u2019d been looking at nothing, merely ruminating on her mother\u2019s overbearing advice. The view from the balcony was spectacular, though. \u201cWhat\u2019s that over there?\u201d\n\u201cYou mean the library? The state invested funds to expand it. We have books from all over the world.\u201d\n\u201cReally? You have a library that big?\u201d Rishe\u2019s eyes sparkled with delight. She pointed out another building. \u201cWhat about that spire? It\u2019s beautiful.\u201d\n\u201cThe church and clock tower. The bells ring out the hour.\u201d\n\u201cOoh, how wonderful! And it looks like there\u2019s a rather big market there too?\u201d\n\u201cYes, the largest market in the city. Carts line up in the early morning. Most of the offerings are made fresh every day.\u201d\n\u201cAmazing! And what about that pretty mountain over there?\u201d\nRishe tried and failed to contain her excitement. She couldn\u2019t help but imagine what seeing all these places up close would be like. The grand library, the beautiful church that told the time, and the morning market with fresh, delicious food\u2014she wanted to experience it all.\nSeeing Arnold\u2019s bemused face, she said, \u201cWhat?\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m just wondering where all this interest is coming from,\u201d he said. \u201cYou were so reluctant to come, yet here you are, brimming with curiosity for my city.\u201d\n\u201cWell\u2026\u201d she trailed off, unsure of how to respond.\nWhat should I say? Should I just tell him the truth?\nThis wasn\u2019t a secret, but talking about her hopes and dreams to the man who had killed her was a little awkward. A strange self-consciousness settled on her, her cheeks heating as she mumbled, \u201cBecause I\u2019ve always wanted to.\u201d\nArnold looked at her keenly. \u201cWanted to what?\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019ve always wanted to come here.\u201d\nDuring her life as a merchant, Rishe developed her single dream to visit everywhere in the world. That dream was cut tragically short when only one country remained: Galkhein.\nIn each of her consecutive lives, Rishe\u2019s priority became staying alive. Every time, without fail, just as she found her footing, the world was plunged into chaos. She never had the chance to see Galkhein. This betrothal was her chance. \u201cIt\u2019s probably why I agreed to marry you,\u201d she added after a moment\u2019s hesitation.\nArnold swept a tepid glance over the city. \u201cThere\u2019s nothing here worth seeing.\u201d\n\u201cThat\u2019s not true! The places you just told me about sound amazing! Your citizens are clean and happy, your knights are proper and kind. Oh, and another\u2014\u201d \nRishe broke off enumerating Galkhein\u2019s charms as Arnold turned to look at her. His face was impassively calm, but something seemed to pass by underneath, like a shadow in deep water.\n\u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d Rishe said. \u201cDid I say something odd?\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m just amazed you could be so unaware of yourself.\u201d \nWh-what a rude thing to\u2014\n\u201cI\u2019ve never met anyone like you. No one has ever spoken to me the way you do. I don\u2019t know any girls of your class with the knowledge or the physical abilities you possess. Noblewomen don\u2019t concern themselves with such things.\u201d\nRishe, there is no need for you to think for yourself.\nShe frowned. \u201cPerhaps you\u2019re right, but everything I\u2019ve learned is precious to me. No one can take my skills away\u2014I value them with my life. Some may say that my knowledge is worthless, but it makes no difference to me.\u201d She turned from the balcony, fixing him with a piercing gaze. \u201cI\u2019m the one who decides what I value.\u201d\nRishe had clawed free of her mother and father\u2019s indoctrination a long time ago. Man, woman\u2014it didn\u2019t matter. She could do anything. Being queen was not the culmination of her life; she wouldn\u2019t trade her freedom for anything.\nArnold matched her intensity. \u201cYou\u2019re right.\u201d He gently cupped her cheek in a one hand, swiping his thumb along the line of her jaw, smearing dust. \u201cLive your life here however you wish. I vow to do my utmost to protect you.\u201d\n\u201cHuh?\u201d\nHis vehemence took her by surprise. Arnold had every right to demand she act the part of a proper consort. This was a political marriage; Rishe was essentially a hostage, after all. Yet here he was, cosigning her misbehavior. Moreover, he was all but swearing to defend her from the consequences.\n\u201cWhy?\u201d\n\u201cYou know why. I\u2019m enamored with you.\u201d Arnold fed her the same line. \u201cI know you said you don\u2019t care about other people\u2019s approval, but I like your asymmetrical talents. I don\u2019t find them useless at all.\u201d \nRishe didn\u2019t know how to respond.\n\u201cI thought I\u2019d already made that clear.\u201d He took his hand back, drawing away, stopping just on the threshold. He turned back to a stunned Rishe and said, \u201cLet me know if there\u2019s anything you desire. I realize I just broke our agreement\u2014the one about not touching you.\u201d\nAnd with that, he was gone.\nShaken, Rishe sank to the floor of the balcony. I can\u2019t predict him at all! Just what is Arnold Hein planning?\nThe quiet of evening fell over the imperial capital of Galkhein.\n \n***\n \n\u201cMmm.\u201d\nSunshine streamed through the window as Rishe roused from sleep. She rolled over, basking in the morning light. The wall she expected wasn\u2019t there, and the bed seemed larger than usual. Taking advantage of it, she stretched out as far as she could.\nWas this her chamber at home? Or maybe she was a merchant again, spending a night at the desert king\u2019s palace. Perhaps this was her bed of straw from her life as a maid? Her memories met and interwove as she drifted into wakefulness.\nWhen Rishe finally opened her eyes, she grew even more confused.\nLight blue curtains surrounded the bed, thin enough to allow sunlight to pass through. She pulled them aside to find herself in a bare room devoid of furniture and carpet.\nOh, right. She didn\u2019t need to report for morning training, tend to her herb garden, prepare breakfast, or see how the bottles she had brewed overnight were coming along.\nRealizing that, Rishe buried her face in the pillow. \u201cSo soft,\u201d she murmured. \nJudging by the position of the sun, it was about six o\u2019clock in the morning. She was pretty sure she had gone to bed around midnight last night.\nI slept for six whole hours? Rishe couldn\u2019t believe it. Generally, she was used to getting about four hours of sleep. On bad days, at the height of an emergency as a knight or apothecary, she wouldn\u2019t even get that much. \nI\u2019ve got nothing but cleaning on the schedule today. Hostages can sleep in, right? At least a little? Excitement suffused her at the thought, but that was interrupted by a knock on the door.\n\u201cLady Rishe, are you awake? It\u2019s Oliver\u2014Prince Arnold\u2019s attendant.\u201d\nRishe sat up with a start. \u201cI\u2019m awake!\u201d\nOliver continued to speak through the door. \u201cI apologize for bothering you at such an early hour. I\u2019m here with a delivery.\u201d\n\u201cJust a moment!\u201d Rishe slipped out of the bed, dressed quickly, and tugged the bed\u2019s canopy closed. She opened the door to find Oliver standing in the hallway with a polite smile.\nHe apologized again. \u201cThis was the only time I could slip away from His Highness\u2019s office. I\u2019m glad to see that you\u2019re already dressed.\u201d\n\u201cNot at all.\u201d Rishe paused, stepping back to allow him inside. \u201cOh my. You look exhausted.\u201d\nOliver grimaced. \u201cIs it that obvious? We\u2019ve been climbing through mountains of paperwork, but never mind me. His Highness has been working around the clock.\u201d\nRishe thought back to yesterday, how he had come all the way out to the balcony. He should have used that spare time to sleep. \u201cHe\u2019s in high demand, isn\u2019t he? He was even working on the trip over.\u201d\n\u201cHe finished all the work he brought along with us,\u201d Oliver confirmed. \u201cNow he\u2019s dealing with everything that piled up during his visit to Hermity.\u201d\n\u201cOh.\u201d Rishe grimaced in sympathy. He may have killed her in a past life, but she wouldn\u2019t wish the bureaucracy of kingship on anyone. \u201cIt\u2019s a shame he had to put his work on hold to attend a silly engagement party.\u201d\n\u201cNo matter. That party was how a committed bachelor finally found a bride.\u201d\nHis smile was sincere, but Rishe knew better. She spread her arms. \u201cGo on. Shall I spin around so you have a better view?\u201d\nOliver blinked. \u201cI beg your pardon?\u201d\n\u201cYou\u2019re looking me over like I\u2019m a horse for sale. If there\u2019s anything I can help you with, please let me know.\u201d\nOliver\u2019s brows went up. He let out a little breath of resignation. \u201cHis Highness was right. You do possess the keen perception of a knight. Of course, I\u2019m purely an amateur myself.\u201d\nI\u2019d say this was a merchant\u2019s sixth sense, rather than battle intuition.\nThis wasn\u2019t the first time Rishe had caught Oliver looking at her. It reminded her of the way her noble customers would examine a product, assessing worth and authenticity. Or a merchant weeding out potential merchandise from a wide array of choices.\nIn other words, he was appraising her.\nOliver moved into a deep, sweeping bow. \u201cMy sincerest apologies, my lady. I have been unaccountably rude to my lord\u2019s consort. My behavior was unacceptable.\u201d\nRishe shook her head. \u201cPlease don\u2019t, it\u2019s fine.\u201d It wasn\u2019t unreasonable for the prince\u2019s closest attendant to be wary of strangers. But it did make her curious. \u201cHow long have you worked for Arnold? Have you always been a valet?\u201d\n\u201cI trained as a squire, actually,\u201d Oliver replied. \u201cBut I was injured and dismissed from the order. His Highness took me into his household soon after. I have served him for nearly a decade.\u201d\n\u201cThen maybe you can answer this,\u201d Rishe said. \u201cWhy is Prince Arnold so very intent on making me his wife?\u201d\nOliver hesitated, as if weighing the pros and cons of speaking, \u201cTo be quite honest, I was as surprised as you were. He\u2019s always insisted he had no interest in marriage. But the sight of you in Hermity has changed his mind. Apparently.\u201d\nSo not even his attendant understood his motives. Rishe remained at a complete loss.\n\u201cIf I may, however?\u201d Oliver mistook Rishe\u2019s confusion for anxiety and added, \u201cI have served Prince Arnold for a long time, and never before have I seen him so happy. When he is with you, he laughs. His smiles are sincere.\u201d\nRishe was taken aback. She\u2019d figured all of Arnold\u2019s",
    "query_text": " laughter and teasing was at her expense. His own private jokes.\n\u201cAre you\u2026unhappy with him?\u201d Oliver ventured. \u201cWith his looks, His Highness is exceedingly popular with the ladies of the court, you know.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m sure he has many admirers.\u201d She paused. \u201cWould you really call the way he acts around me \u2018happy\u2019? To me, it seems more like a cat with a mouse.\u201d\nOliver laughed. He didn\u2019t deny it. \u201cI am pleased you understand His Highness so well. Oh, I nearly forgot. Here.\u201d\nHe held out a sheaf of three documents. \u201cThis is the guest list for your wedding. His Highness bids you look over it.\u201d\n\u201cThank you,\u201d Rishe said, pleasantly surprised. She hadn\u2019t even needed to ask. She gave it a quick glance, quickly identifying the most prominent and powerful names.\nKing Zahad, Prince Kyle, Princess Harriet"

    "prefix_text": "? Oh, it looks like they\u2019re playing a new song.\u201d\nA soft melody drifted across the hall. The crowd divided, heading toward the center of the floor or against the wall. The next dance was starting, and everyone was waiting to see what the crown prince and his new fianc\u00e9e would do.\n\u201cWe don\u2019t have to dance if you don\u2019t want to,\u201d Arnold said.\n\u201cOh? As it happens, I like dancing.\u201d Plus, she couldn\u2019t resist a blatant challenge. She offered him her hand.\n\u201cVery well, then.\u201d Arnold only hesitated for a moment before taking it and steering her gently to an empty spot on the floor. He didn\u2019t seem like the dancing type, but his movements were slick and effortless. Facing one another, they joined hands. Arnold wrapped his other arm around her waist. \nOoh. His hand felt huge against her back. She realized she was breathing a little faster. They\u2019d never been this close before.\nNo, that isn\u2019t quite true. This is the second time. Rishe\u2019s final memories from her last life flashed vividly through her mind.\nThis was indeed the second time they had been this close\u2014the first had ended with a sword through her chest.\nEmperor Arnold Hein had single-handedly decimated the knights in the castle. Rishe stood in the midst of the carnage, breath ragged as she gripped the hilt of her sword, slick with her own blood. She was the last line of defense. The chamber behind her housed the royal family.\nIf they could reach the hidden passageways, the young prince and his party could find shelter with their allies across the border. Rishe and the other knights were prepared to sacrifice their lives to allow the royal family to survive. Their escape meant victory.\nBells tolled out, urging flight. All is lost. Run. Rishe managed to graze Arnold\u2019s cheek with her blade before she looked down to find his jet-black sword blooming out of her chest.\nShe remembered how it burned, as if the blade was made of fire. It was heat, not pain, but her breathing grew labored, and when Emperor Arnold Hein withdrew his sword, Rishe crumpled. \nHe knelt by her side and whispered something.\nThe words were seared into her memory. Rishe squeezed Arnold\u2019s hand as they danced.\nI\u2019ll be the bully this time. \nRishe shifted her weight back, slipping out of the hold on her waist. She broke Arnold\u2019s lead and spun, drifting on the harmony of the dance. She took him by surprise; his eyes went wide.\nI wonder what you\u2019ll do when you\u2019re no longer on top, Your Highness. Her smile was a declaration of war. Watching him attempt to follow her lead would be delightful. She pulled his hand toward her, attempting to move them into a spin.\nBut Arnold held fast. He planted his hand on her waist and turned them in a different direction, using her inertia against her. Hey! As a result, Rishe twirled by herself on the spot.\nShe didn\u2019t miss a step. She turned elegantly, the hem of her dress whispering across the ballroom floor. She heard appreciative murmurs from the wallflowers lined up watching.\nDespite that, Rishe took it as a defeat. Round one to Arnold. \nSo\u2026you can think on your feet. How about this?\nArnold remained unruffled, evading her next scheme like it was nothing. He grinned down at her, his eyes shining with a dare.\nHe thinks I can\u2019t beat him. His ease vexed her, but it was his smugness that made her angry.\nShe let out a hard breath, attempting a maneuver to lure him in while turning. He leaned back, not falling for it at all.\nHe\u2019s just too good at changing his center of gravity! She kept her astonishment under wraps, but she felt it. Despite how close we\u2019re dancing, I can\u2019t throw off his timing at all. He\u2019s sidestepped all my attempts, and he takes back the lead the second I let down my guard!\nIt made her increasingly angry. She twirled and stepped as the dance dictated, all the while feeling out for moments of weakness. Arnold played along with her game, completely unruffled.\nEvery single time. I\u2019m doing my utmost to trip him up, but he doesn\u2019t even seem annoyed! At this point she\u2019d just settle for any reaction at all.\nTheir unusual dance style had gathered a crowd. Rishe paid them no mind, focused only on her goal. Then something occurred to her, and her breath caught in her throat.\nWait a minute, he has left an opening. It\u2019s the same one from before. She thought back to their fight to the death, to that moment when she had managed to draw blood. That may indeed have been his only weakness.\nIf I strike the same way\u2014huh? Before she could try, Arnold appeared to lose patience, wrapping his arm around her waist. He bent her back into a dip so deep it felt like he\u2019d pulled a carpet from under her feet. She yelped, grabbing at him reflexively, clinging tight. His big hands gripped her securely enough to mitigate the sensation of falling. Relief flooded through her, and she felt a laugh rumble against her ear.\nThe music came to an end with one last ringing note. She blinked. The dance is over?\nA hush fell over the ballroom. Then cheers broke out, followed by a round of applause.\n\u201cThat was incredible!\u201d\nThe watching nobles crowded in.\n\u201cYou two moved in such perfect harmony!\u201d\n\u201cI was on the edge of my seat. I felt like I was watching a sword duel!\u201d\n\u201cIs this a dance from Hermity? I\u2019ve never seen such steps before.\u201d\n\u201cUh, well\u2026\u201d Rishe floundered. She glanced up at Arnold, who appeared to be enjoying her struggle. She\u2019d get no help from him.\nRishe dealt with the barrage of questions as best she could, letting the crowd sweep them into the dining room, which was set up for a buffet-style meal. She made sure to greet every guest, riveting their faces into her memory.\nShe must have been acting peculiar, because Arnold eventually said, \u201cRishe, I think the wine is getting to you. Shall we get some fresh air?\u201d\nRishe hadn\u2019t touched a single drop. In fact, she\u2019d been caught up in so many conversations that she hadn\u2019t even had the chance to eat, but she had experience working on an empty stomach. She accepted Arnold\u2019s encouragement as the escape it was.\nJust when I least expect it, he\u2019ll act the gentleman. Maybe he\u2019d remembered her demand for a carefree life of doing nothing.\nRishe cast a charming look across the crowd. \u201cThank you for your consideration, Your Highness. Forgive me.\u201d She gave a polite bow before quietly slipping away. \nShe didn\u2019t head straight to the balcony but rather slowly walked around the hall. There was only so much she could find out glued to Arnold\u2019s side all night.\nI need information. Galkhein\u2019s political landscape was a mystery to me through all my past lives. I only know the rumors that made it abroad.\nAlthough she knew of Arnold\u2019s eventual patricide, she had no concept of the circumstances leading up to it. She needed a better picture of the factions and power balance inside the court. The lives these people led.\nI know better than to believe wartime gossip. This Arnold Hein is a lot different from what I\u2019d heard he was like at nineteen. He\u2019s not as diabolical as the rumors led me to believe. He likes to push, but he isn\u2019t unkind. The thought drifted across her mind, leaving her conflicted. Well, he\u2019s not unkind now. But I still don\u2019t like not knowing his motives. And he\u2019s a bit of a jerk, to be honest. \nShe tried to settle her mind and just observe. Gathering intelligence was necessary to lead a long, carefree life lazing around the palace.\nIf I recall correctly, that\u2019s Lord Hannawald. He seems to be on good terms with Count Gayle. Duke Hudemann and Duke Teinitz are having a friendly enough conversation, yet they don\u2019t seem close. Rishe ticked off the names of people she\u2019d met, committing them to memory.\nA wave of sweet perfume wafted over her. A pretty girl with soft blonde hair had appeared at her side. \u201cHow do you do, Lady Rishe? I\u2019m Cornelia Thea Toona.\u201d\nDuke Toona\u2019s family was the thirty-first house she\u2019d met tonight.\nRishe smiled graciously. \u201cRishe Irmgard Weitzner. A pleasure to meet you.\u201d\n\u201cThe pleasure is all mine.\u201d Cornelia smiled sweetly. Her eyes were big and bright, her lips full. She held a glass in each hand and offered one to Rishe. \u201cWine? I see you\u2019re empty-handed.\u201d\nA gaggle of other ladies nearby began giggling among themselves.\n\u201cHow dare she act so haughty when she\u2019s a captive. It\u2019s time for her learn just what she is. A pawn to be played and discarded.\u201d\n\u201cShe should enjoy her time on Prince Arnold\u2019s arm while she can.\u201d\n\u201cShe is from a minor nation, after all.\u201d\nAs Rishe took note of their whispers, Cornelia gazed at her with doe eyes. \u201cDoes my offering offend you in some way?\u201d\nIf I remember correctly, House Toona holds a vast territory in southern Galkhein.\nRishe held out a hand to accept the glass. \u201cHow could it? Thank you, Lady Cornelia.\u201d\nBefore Rishe could touch the glass, Cornelia gave a dramatic shout. \u201cOh dear! My hand slipped!\u201d She dropped it, quite obviously on purpose. Without thinking, Rishe grabbed her skirts and leaned back, plucking the glass out of the air with the other hand.\nCornelia let out a cry of surprise as Rishe caught the wine before any could spill. She swirled the glass and brought it to her nose to breathe in the bouquet.\nHmm\u2026 That\u2019s mashed capsicum. Where did she even get that? What a waste of perfectly good wine. And why bother spicing it enough to singe the tongue if she just planned to ruin my dress? Pick a plan, my dear.\nHiding her exasperation, Rishe smiled brightly. \u201cI\u2019ve never had a wine quite like this. What an unusual scent.\u201d\nCornelia bit her lip in frustration. Rishe beamed at her. You\u2019ve got such a pretty face, Lady Toona. Why don\u2019t you smile?\nRishe leaned in close to Cornelia. \u201cThis vintage isn\u2019t available where I\u2019m from. I\u2019m ever so anxious to learn more. Should I perhaps invite Prince Arnold over to enjoy a glass? Which tray did you get this from?\u201d\n\u201cWhat? Oh, um\u2026\u201d Rishe had a policy of never backing down from a fight, but it seemed Cornelia didn\u2019t share it. \u201cS-sorry, but I don\u2019t remember. Such a large hall, you see.\u201d\n\u201cA shame. I\u2019ll just give His Highness this one, then. I\u2019ll be sure to let him know who it\u2019s from.\u201d\n\u201cUh, wait!\u201d Cornelia rapidly shook her head. \u201cI-I got that glass for you, so I think you should\u2014you know what? Never mind! Maybe I should just take that\u2014oh no!\u201d\nRishe ignored the ashen-faced Cornelia, raising the glass and swallowing down a gulp. \n\u201cI-I can\u2019t believe\u2026\u201d\n\u201cSuch a spicy flavor, just as I imagined.\u201d Rishe smiled again to the assembled group\u2019s astonishment. \u201cWhat a warm welcome. I do hope the two of us can spend more time together. Perhaps\u2026a tea party?\u201d\n\u201cTh-the two of us?\u201d Cornelia stammered.\n\u201cYes. I want to know all about House Toona.\u201d\nCornelia looked flabbergasted, but she recovered herself and nodded.\nThat should do. One of Rishe\u2019s eventual plans required a plot of land in a temperate climate. House Toona\u2019s would likely be perfect, but she needed to confirm a few things with Cornelia. Never back down from a fight. Even further\u2026\nShe recalled the words of her mentor from her days as a merchant.\nDon\u2019t bother with fights you can\u2019t win.\nThe other ladies fled, fearful of this strange girl who gulped down painfully spicy wine like it was nothing. \n \n***\n \nRishe retreated to the empty balcony to enjoy the music, grimacing with every stinging mouthful of wine. She drank it in decreasing sips until Arnold joined her.\n\u201cWhat are you making that face for?\u201d\nRishe swirled the glass. \u201cDon\u2019t worry, it\u2019s not you. It\u2019s just this wine is so spicy.\u201d\n\u201cSpicy? The wine is?\u201d\n\u201cMm. It\u2019s seasoned with capsicum. I barely managed to get that first mouthful down without gagging.\u201d\nArnold swiped the glass from her hand. \u201cDon\u2019t tell me this was a poisoning attempt!\u201d\nRishe clicked her tongue in annoyance at her own lack of vigilance. No one else would be able to grab something from her so easily.\nArnold glared at the wine. \u201cYou don\u2019t need to drink this. I\u2019ll get rid of it.\u201d\n\u201cHey, give that back! They ruined a perfectly good glass of wine because of me. I\u2019m not going to waste it.\u201d She grabbed it back and took another sip, shuddering at the taste.\nArnold glowered. \u201cTell me who did this. I\u2019ll have them executed.\u201d\n\u201cDon\u2019t be ridiculous. You don\u2019t kill people like her\u2014you use them.\u201d Just the tiniest bit of wine to go, but it was getting harder to make herself drink it. She gave the glass a reproachful look, then glanced back at Arnold. \u201cOh, and I owe you an apology.\u201d\n\u201cDo you?\u201d\n\u201cI used your name to defend myself.\u201d The girls had only backed off when she threatened to tattle to Arnold. Rishe found that sort of thing inelegant in the extreme, and she was embarrassed.\nArnold sighed at Rishe\u2019s apologetic bow. \u201cThere\u2019s nothing wrong with a wife invoking her husband\u2019s name.\u201d\nRishe hesitated. \u201cWe\u2019re not married yet.\u201d\n\u201cThat\u2019s a formality. It\u2019s as good as done, if you ask me.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2026see.\u201d\nHe took her distraction as an opportunity to swipe her glass back. Instead of dumping it out, Arnold gulped the rest of it down. \n\u201cDamn, that packs a punch,\u201d he grumbled.\n\u201cI told you that!\u201d Rishe snapped. \u201cAre you all right? Let me get you some water!\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m fine. But now you\u2019ve fulfilled your obligation to the wine, haven\u2019t you?\u201d\nRishe didn\u2019t know what to say. He\u2019d helped her\u2014not by taking charge but by following her lead. Without cutting her down and telling her she was being foolish. Without rolling his eyes and dismissing her desires as trifles.\n\u201cThank you,\u201d Rishe said stiffly, which just made him laugh.\n\u201cWhat were you thinking about when we were dancing?\u201d he asked.\n\u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d",
    "query_text": "\n\u201cYou were thinking about someone else, weren\u2019t you? Who?\u201d\nRishe didn\u2019t know a delicate way to say I was thinking about a future version of you I met in another life.\n\u201cHmm?\u201d His tone was oddly light, teasing even. But the gleam in his hunter\u2019s eyes said she wouldn\u2019t get away so easily.\nObviously, Rishe couldn\u2019t give him an honest answer. \u201cI wasn\u2019t thinking about anyone else. I was worried about you.\u201d\n\u201cWhy?\u201d\nThis was the closest she could come to the truth. \u201cWere you injured here?\u201d She patted her own left shoulder with her forefinger. \nArnold went silent. His left shoulder was slightly slower to react than his right\u2014if his right was at one hundred, then his left was at maybe ninety-eight. It was hardly noticeable, but Rishe had picked up on"

    "prefix_text": " new job, no matter who you are,\u201d Rishe said as she kept scrubbing. \u201cAnd it\u2019s not like you\u2019ve never washed a single thing in your life before, right?\u201d\nElsie nodded nervously. \nRishe had realized over the past few days doing the laundry that not all the newcomers were complete amateurs. They\u2019d obviously done chores at home, or something similar. When set a specific task, they could perform it properly, but Diana\u2019s complaints weren\u2019t unfounded. They did take far too much time with laundry.\nBut it\u2019s obvious why. \u201cDo you know anything about Diana?\u201d Rishe asked Elsie. \u201cLike, is she from a well-off family?\u201d\nElsie said, \u201cI heard that her father was a business owner. She worked with him.\u201d\n\u201cI heard that as well,\u201d added another maid. \u201cBut he fell into debt and had to sell off.\u201d \nRishe stopped scrubbing for a moment to consider this.\n\u201cUm, is something the matter?\u201d Elsie asked.\nRishe smiled and shook her head. \u201cNo, nothing. Let\u2019s just focus on getting these washed for the time being.\u201d\n \n***\n \nThat afternoon, thirty maids were assembled in the detached wing of the palace. Ten of them were old hands, long in service to the royal family, while the other twenty were freshly hired. The crown princess was to choose her maids from among these thirty. They wore their nerves plainly on their sleeves. \n\u201cHey, I thought this palace was in a terrible state of neglect,\u201d one maid whispered. \u201cWhy is it so sparkling clean?\u201d\n\u201cYeah, you\u2019re right,\u201d said another. \u201cSomeone must have sorted it out before we arrived.\u201d\n\u201cI wonder what kind of person Lady Rishe is. Ooh, I\u2019m so nervous.\u201d\nThe girls looked around anxiously.\n\u201cHey, Elsie, that girl who was always helping us isn\u2019t here.\u201d\nElsie blinked. \u201cYou\u2019re right.\u201d\n\u201cLook, Diana. That impertinent newbie didn\u2019t get picked.\u201d \nAt her friend\u2019s observation, Diana preened with satisfaction. \u201cNo surprise there. You need some manners to attend to Lady Rishe. I bet she got kicked out of the running!\u201d Her eyes sparkled with confidence.\nAt last, there was a knock at the door.\n\u201cHer Royal Highness, Princess Rishe.\u201d\nThe maids quickly fell into bows. Diana\u2019s chest ached with anticipation as heels clicked on the floor, approaching the line of girls. From the corner of their eyes, the maids saw a wide-skirted court dress. A gentle scent washed over them.\nWithout even looking at her, they could tell Crown Princess Rishe was a lovely woman. Diana and her friends swelled with pride that she was to become their mistress.\nBut then Laura whispered to Diana, \u201cHey, isn\u2019t this scent familiar?\u201d\n\u201cQuiet!\u201d Clearly it was some sort of expensive perfume. Or so Diana thought, but then she realized what it was. The words just slipped out. \u201cIt\u2019s soap.\u201d\n\u201cHuh? Did you just say something?\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s soap. The same kind we always use.\u201d Diana was sure of it.\nThe princess said, \u201cPlease rise.\u201d \nWhy did her voice sound so familiar? An incredible foreboding gripping her, Diana looked up. She gasped.\n\u201cMy name is Rishe Irmgard Weitzner.\u201d\nBefore her stood the beautiful newcomer\u2014the thorn in her side for the past few days. The smile she wore was peaceful and just the slightest bit satisfied.\n \n***\n \nI\u2019m so glad I managed to finish washing the sheets in time!\nStanding before the maids with Arnold\u2019s attendant Oliver at her side, Rishe was panicking on the inside. She\u2019d had so much to do this morning that she\u2019d put off the laundry to the last minute. She took deep, controlled breaths, praying no one would notice that she\u2019d raced here at a dead sprint.\nOliver was none the wiser as he spoke to the assembled girls. Rishe took the opportunity to look them over. She locked eyes with Elsie, who was gaping at her. It was a nice change\u2014usually her face was as blank as a rock wall.\nI\u2019m sorry for the deception. I figured blending in would give me the best picture of your working conditions.\nThe new maids wore similarly shocked expressions, while others watched her with delight. Meanwhile, the veterans, including Diana, had all gone pale. They trembled, stunned into silence. One seemed locked in a terrifying trance, while another looked on the verge of tears. All of them had spoken to Rishe with derision. As the ringleader, Diana was covering her mouth with both hands, like she was holding in a scream.\nOliver had finished his introduction. \u201cYour Highness, if you would?\u201d\nRishe stepped forward. \u201cFirst, I must apologize to you for what has transpired prior to this meeting. My deception, that is. However, it has granted me insight into how each one of you works.\u201d\nOliver\u2019s face creased in confusion. The newcomer maids began to panic, whispering among themselves.\n\u201cDoesn\u2019t this mean that she helped us out with the laundry?\u201d\n\u201cWe\u2019re going to be fired!\u201d\n\u201cIf I lose my position, my brother will have to quit school!\u201d\nNoticing the commotion, Oliver glanced at Rishe. \u201cYour Highness, two-thirds of these maids are newly recruited from the city. Since the majority of the castle maids were elderly, His Highness assumed you would prefer maids closer in age to yourself.\u201d\nRishe was startled. She had found it odd that most of her potential servants were new hires, but she hadn\u2019t expected this to be the reason.\n\u201cWhile the prince has entrusted the selection of your maids to you,\u201d Oliver went on. \u201cHiring someone with no experience will not do. Despite Prince Arnold\u2019s views, I urge you to reject the newcomers.\u201d\n\u201cOliver.\u201d\n\u201cI have a list of their names here. Elsie\u2014\u201d\n\u201cElsie, Nichole, Hilde, Marguerite, Rosa.\u201d Rishe began listing the names of the newly recruited maids. She\u2019d made a point to memorize them in the washhouse. \u201cElke, Amelia, and\u2014\u201d\nOliver looked at her wildly. \u201cYou know them all?! Even though they\u2019ve never served you in the past?\u201d\n\u201cYes, of course I do. Servants are essential to the maintenance of our lifestyle, why wouldn\u2019t I get to know them?\u201d Rishe listed the remaining names for good measure. \u201cAll twenty of you, listen to me.\u201d \nThe new maids stiffened. Diana and the other maids whose names hadn\u2019t been called were getting their wind back, wearing increasingly triumphant looks.\nRishe said, \u201cThe twenty names I just called will be my maids.\u201d\nTime seemed to stand still a moment, and then Oliver broke in with an astonished, \u201cB-but, my lady! They are all inexperienced\u2014\u201d\n\u201cYes. And my palace will be the perfect place to learn.\u201d\nThe new recruits were completely speechless, unsure of exactly what was happening. \nRishe smiled at Elsie. \u201cI hope you\u2019ll serve me well, Elsie.\u201d\nElsie was still frozen in place. \u201cHuh? Y-yes, my lady, but\u2014\u201d\nA shaking Diana cried out, \u201cBut why, my lady?! You\u2019ve seen their work! They\u2019re useless, the lot of them! The rest of us get so much more done in a shorter amount of time!\u201d\n\u201cWatch your tongue, girl,\u201d Oliver said sharply.\nDiana ignored him. \u201cWe\u2019re hard workers! Any job you assign us, we can do it! Please, I beg you, my lady!\u201d\n\u201cStep back,\u201d Oliver warned. \u201cDo not take a single step closer to Lady Rishe.\u201d\nDiana spoke in a rush, words pouring out of her. \u201cI-I freely admit that I was impolite before, but I didn\u2019t know who she was! I\u2019ll take any punishment, so please, give me the chance to show you how well I can work!\u201d\nRishe said, \u201cDiana, I have a request.\u201d\n\u201cTh-thank you, my lady!\u201d Diana heaved a sigh of relief. \u201cYou mean you\u2019ll\u2014\u201d \nRishe cut across her. \u201cAs of today, you are no longer a maid in this palace.\u201d \n\u201cWhat?\u201d Her face, usually so fixed with determination, paled. \u201cBut why? I\u2019m so much better than any of them! I\u2019ll do a perfect job no matter what task you set before me. Please don\u2019t dismiss me, my lady!\u201d \n\u201cListen to me, Diana.\u201d Rishe dropped her lofty tone, speaking as one woman would to another. \u201cYou have noticed it, haven\u2019t you? No matter what you claim, these new girls aren\u2019t worthless.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2026I don\u2019t understand.\u201d\n\u201cCan you remember your first month in service? How difficult it",
    "query_text": " was?\u201d\nDiana looked completely bewildered. Her gaze darted around as if looking for help.\nPulling herself together, she forced herself to follow Rishe\u2019s directions. She thought back and finally alighted on a response. \u201cI\u2026I didn\u2019t know how to do the job. Before, when"

    "prefix_text": "\u2019s engagement party would be one such occasion. He\u2019d gathered elites from far and wide to introduce to his beloved Mary.\nThe man eyed Rishe with rising curiosity. \u201cYou know me? This is my first time in Hermity.\u201d\nUh-oh. Rishe pasted on a smile as her mind spun in circles. This man was dangerous. She had to avoid entanglements with him at all costs. Five years from now, Arnold Hein would invade Hermity. \nHe was an extraordinarily skilled swordsman and, with a powerful military at his back, was destined to conquer kingdom after kingdom. He had done as much in her second, third, fourth, and fifth lives. In her sixth, Rishe had faced him in battle herself and died by his hand.\nWe never had a chance. That war was lost before it began.\nArnold\u2019s brilliance lay not in his swordplay but in his skill as a tactician. He set countries up for conquest and knocked them down, swallowing them one by one.\nI know him, but he doesn\u2019t know me. We haven\u2019t met in this life. I need an excuse fast. \nRishe curtsied slowly. \u201cMy name is Rishe Irmgard Weitzner. We\u2019ve never been introduced, but I\u2019ve heard of you.\u201d\nArnold donned an amused smile. \u201cYou plant your weight like a trained swordswoman. Your center of gravity is perfect.\u201d\n\u201cYou exaggerate,\u201d Rishe demurred. \u201cThat was simply a curtsy to an esteemed guest.\u201d \n\u201cI must have misheard, but I swear you called me \u2018emperor\u2019 just now.\u201d \nRishe froze.\n\u201cMy father yet lives,\u201d Arnold said. \u201cI am simply a crown prince. Why would you call me that?\u201d \n\u201cUh, um\u2026\u201d Rishe floundered for an answer.\nShe\u2019d made such a foolish mistake. Arnold\u2019s gaze cut right through her. It felt like he\u2019d see through any lie she told right down to her soul. She remembered this from the battlefield\u2014how his attention alone felt like a sword thrust.\nBut why even bother to lie? They\u2019d never meet again, so who cared what he thought of her? Sure, she harbored a hard feeling or two over the recent slaying, but there was no point complaining about it to this Arnold. Calling him the emperor was boorish, but Rishe was in the process of being forcibly exiled. Why play at diplomacy?\nShe took a deep breath and bowed low. This was not the curtsy of a noble lady but of a servant bowing in supplication to her master.\n\u201cMy humblest apologies, Your Highness. I was in a rush. Such a rude slip of the tongue.\u201d She raised her head. \u201cMy ex-fianc\u00e9 just annulled our engagement, so I\u2019ve got a lot on my mind. If you would excuse me.\u201d \n\u201cHe annulled your engagement?\u201d\nAt that, Rishe turned and fled.\nThis unexpected run-in with Arnold had taken up valuable time. She threw open the door to the balcony and hiked up her skirts, kicking off her shoes in anticipation of jumping into a tree. Looking down, she realized the ground was far closer than she\u2019d feared.\nExcellent! I can just drop into the garden!\nArnold, who up until now had been rendered speechless, shook himself out of his fugue as Rishe clambered over the railing. \u201cHey!\u201d\nRishe\u2019s moonlight-silver dress flowed around her as she leapt. The lawn was soft, but the fall was still far enough to risk injury.\nWeight evenly distributed on the soles of my feet, roll to transfer the impact to my shins and thighs, then onto my hips and my back.\nShe landed safely, rolled nimbly in her dress, and popped back up. Her hair was covered in leaves. \nI need to hurry up!\nBracing against a nearby rock, she used her weight to snap the heels off of her shoes. There. That would make running a little easier. Satisfied, she slipped them back on and made haste toward the family estate. \n \n***\n \nUp on the balcony, Crown Prince Arnold of Galkhein watched the spectacle play out from beginning to end. He gazed at the girl with the coral hair. Her appearance was that of any young noblewoman, but she moved like a well-trained knight. She\u2019d leapt from the balcony and landed skillfully, showing no signs of distress at her ripped dress or disheveled hair. Instead, she\u2019d knocked the heels off her shoes and dashed away.\nAlso, she had called him an emperor.\nPlaying it all over again in his head, Arnold broke out into a rare chuckle. As his shoulders quivered with laughter, his attendant approached him from behind.\n\u201cThere you are, Your Highness. What are you doing out here? I\u2019m aware you don\u2019t desire a wife, but beginning the search would be wise\u2026 Er, Your Highness?\u201d The attendant\u2019s eyes flew wide. His bored and scowling master was laughing. \u201cDid something happen?\u201d\n\u201cOliver, ready my coach. Wait, no. That will take too much time. Bring me a horse.\u201d\n\u201cAt once, Your Highness. Might I ask why?\u201d\nArnold didn\u2019t respond\u2014he just grinned like a hungry wolf catching scent of his prey.\n \n***\n \nOnce outside the palace gates, Rishe threw herself into the waiting coach, shouting for the driver to make haste. She stopped it a few hundred yards from the manor and bid him farewell. \u201cI\u2019m leaving! Thanks for always being such a safe driver, Daniel!\u201d\nThe road to the manor was muddy from a morning rain shower. She knew from her second life that the coach would get stuck, resulting in a loss of valuable time. It was better to just get out and run. \n\u201cHuff, huff.\u201d Despite her last life\u2019s physical conditioning, this body had no stamina. She\u2019d need to try to get fitter faster this time around.\nRishe reached the end of the road, and her heart promptly sank all the way to her feet. \u201cOh no.\u201d\nThe front door was thronged with people, all of them surrounding a carriage bearing the royal family\u2019s coat of arms.\nI need to get out of here.\nWhile she stood frozen in indecision, one of the knights doing crowd control shouted, \u201cYour Highness! I have eyes on Lady Rishe!\u201d\n\u201cGet out of my way!\u201d A familiar voice started up a bellow. \u201cLet me through! Rishe, how dare you make me wait so long?\u201d\nRishe\u2019s ex-fianc\u00e9, Crown Prince Dietrich, stepped triumphantly forward.\n\u201cI know the thought of hearing your crimes enumerated by the man you love must pain you, but alas, as future king, it is my duty to bring down the hammer of justice upon a villainess such as yourself!\u201d\n\u201cI see I\u2019ve timed it badly,\u201d Rishe muttered. \u201cIn fact, this is my worst loop yet. I\u2019d rather be barred from the house than see you again.\u201d\n\u201cHmm? What are you grumbling about?\u201d Dietrich looked Rishe up and down. \u201cI knew it. You put on a brave face, but I can sense the sorrow in your heart.\u201d\n\u201cI beg your pardon?\u201d\n\u201cYour heart!\u201d the prince repeated. \u201cYour heart! It must be absolutely crushed! Because I called off our engagement!\u201d\nRishe wasn\u2019t sure where he was drawing these conclusions from. Possibly the same place he mined for all his bottomless self-confidence.\n\u201cI can tell you\u2019ve been wandering aimlessly, distraught,\u201d the prince went on. \u201cLook at you. Your dress is caked in mud, your shoes are broken, and there are cuts marring your face and arms. What other possible cause could there be than heartbreak?\u201d\nRishe narrowed her eyes. \u201cDo you ever stop to think about the words coming out of your mouth?\u201d\n\u201cWhat?\u201d\nHis interpretation of events was fanciful to the point of absurdity. \u201cI did not dirty my dress or snap my shoes out of heartbreak. Because I feel none. You\u2019ve always been a little slow, so I\u2019ll make this clear: I do not have a single shred of fondness for you, or for our broken engagement.\u201d\n\u201cWhat?!\u201d the prince said. \u201cWhat are you saying?!\u201d\nThe surrounding crowd began to snicker.\n\u201cIsn\u2019t that the crown prince? Did Lady Rishe just dump him?\u201d\n\u201cWait, but wasn\u2019t he trying to dump her?\u201d\n\u201cCan\u2019t be! Look at her! She doesn\u2019t care at all!\u201d\n\u201cHow dare you nobodies make sport of me?\u201d Dietrich screeched. \u201cI am your prince!\u201d\nTemper aside, Dietrich was a handsome man. He had azure-blue eyes and blond hair\u2014a prince straight out of a picture book. His looks and place in the succession meant a never-ending swarm of women vying for his affections. He was brought up a pampered princeling, never wanting for anything. It manifested in a pompous manner and an overconfidence in his own abilities. Rishe had cautioned him about his attitude before, but he never paid her any mind.\nI\u2019m so glad I don\u2019t have to marry him.\nShe wished she could go back and tell the shocked, scared girl from her first life not to worry about her shattered engagement. Still, she might as well say it all here and now, with the assembled knights and citizens to bear witness.\n\u201cYour Highness, you exist to love and protect your people. It\u2019s unbecoming to speak of them in this manner.\u201d\n\u201cYou\u2019re the unbecoming one!\u201d the prince snapped. \u201cBeg me for forgiveness!\u201d\n\u201cI won\u2019t. Calling off our betrothal is the best course, and I applaud Your Highness for your good sense.\u201d\nNow even the knights were trembling with suppressed mirth. \nDietrich was turning red. \u201cD-don\u2019t laugh at me!\u201d\n\u201cLady Rishe,\u201d came a sweet voice. \u201cAren\u2019t you ashamed of yourself?\u201d \nRishe fought down a groan.\nOut of the crowd stepped a charming, dainty girl. Her big eyes moist with tears, she took her place at Dietrich\u2019s side. \u201cI do not allow the people I care about to be treated so very ill!\u201d \n\u201cWhy, Lady Mary. You\u2019re here.\u201d Rishe sighed. \u201cHow nice.\u201d\nThe young Mary scowled through her tears. Hidden behind her skirts, Dietrich continued to shout his disapproval. \u201cRishe! You\u2019ve brought my beloved Mary to tears! She\u2019s told me everything. How you bullied her, ridiculed her. How you find it amusing to lock her in the classroom overnight! Such a wicked woman could never be queen!\u201d\nNone of that\u2019s true.\nRishe glanced at Mary, who averted her gaze a little awkwardly.\n\u201cMore importantly,\u201d Rishe said, \u201chave you already brought your concerns to my parents, Your Highness?\u201d\n\u201cMore importantly?! I did, if you must know! Your parents are furious. They have vowed to disown you.\u201d\n\u201cAh. Then I\u2019m too late.\u201d Her parents held their reputation above all else. Rishe had little hope of retrieving any of her money or belongings now.\n\u201cWhy are you acting so strangely?\u201d Dietrich sniffed. \u201cAh, I understand. You\u2019re in such shock from this turn of events that\u2014\u201d\n\u201cListen, Dietrich.\u201d In her exasperation, Rishe dropped his title. \u201cI accept your decree. We are no longer engaged. I shall never darken your doorstep again. So\u2026relax a little.\u201d\n\u201cHuh? What are you saying?\u201d\n\u201cSince I was a child, I believed that my only value was in our betrothal. Being engaged to the crown prince was my whole reason for living. I was wrong about that. Only I determine my value\u2014no one else. That\u2019s why I don\u2019t care about this. I\u2019m beyond it.\u201d Rishe made sure to look him directly in the eye as she spoke. \u201cYou are an unnecessary element in my life.\u201d\nDietrich staggered back. His legs seemed to go out from under him, and he crumpled. At that, the knights finally let go of their composure, laughing along with the courtiers.\n\u201cSt-stop!\u201d the prince wailed. \u201cYou are my subjects. This\u2026this shows such flagrant disrespect!\u201d\n\u201cDietrich, don\u2019t pay them any mind,\u201d Lady Mary said. \u201cLady Rishe, is this cruelty necessary?\u201d\n\u201cPerhaps this is a blessing in disguise.\u201d Rishe\u2019s attention moved to Mary, making the girl\u2019s slender shoulders jump. She had no reason to worry; Rishe didn\u2019t bite. \u201cI\u2019ve been wanting the opportunity to speak to you, Lady Mary. You\u2019re strong. I admire you very much.\u201d\n\u201cWhat are you talking about?\u201d\n\u201cYou\u2019re a lovely girl who never fails to smile despite your troubles. You don\u2019t put up walls around your heart, and you do your utmost to put others at ease. Even now, you bravely stand before me to protect the prince.\u201d\nMary\u2019s eyes were wide with confusion. Rishe picked her words carefully, attempting to diminish the girl\u2019s guilty feelings, if only a little. \u201cYou need to marry the prince for your family\u2019s sake, right?\u201d\n\u201cHow do you\u2014?\u201d\nRishe had learned this truth in one of her past lives. Mary was born to a poor family, and she had studied like mad to be accepted into the academy to hunt for a husband. She intended to make sure neither she nor her brothers ever went hungry again.\nShe went on, \u201cRemember this: you are the one in control of your life. Don\u2019t sell it to anyone else. Can you trust a man who so easily discards the woman he\u2019s been engaged to since childhood? Do you truly believe he cares for you?\u201d\nAstonishment bloomed across Mary\u2019s face. She looked over at Dietrich, who hadn\u2019t bothered to stand up. The truth was\u2026within a year, Prince Dietrich would be in prison, his title stripped from him. He would plan a mad coup d\u2019\u00e9tat against the king, attempting to provoke the citizens to war. His plan would be discovered in its early stages, rendering him a laughingstock across the kingdom.\n\u201cYou must shape your future with your own hands\u2014you mustn\u2019t entrust your desires to others.\u201d \n\u201cMy\u2026my desires?\nRishe nodded.\nMary was looking at her like she was speaking a foreign language. \u201cBut I\u2019m their elder sister.\u201d Her voice quivered. \u201cI must endure, no matter what. Otherwise, my brothers will never be happy.\u201d\n\u201cAnd you believe their happiness can only be achieved by sacrificing your own?\u201d\nMary gasped as she gaped at Rishe.\n\u201cYou don\u2019t need to throw away your own future to protect those you love,\u201d Rishe told her. \u201cNo matter what path you choose, never forget that.\u201d\n\u201cMy future?\u201d Mary\u2019s voice went ragged, like she was barely suppressing a wail of pain.\n\u201cI wish you a life where both you and your family can be happy,\u201d said Rishe.\nMary stood frozen in place, eyes gleaming like precious stones. Rishe couldn\u2019t help but admire how pretty she was. She truly did wish her happiness. But right now, she needed to take care of herself. \n\u201cWell.\u201d Rishe suddenly broke into a smile, making Dietrich flinch. \u201cI think it\u2019s time for me to be on my way.\u201d\nShe regretted losing access to her room, but she knew her parents wouldn\u2019t let her in. Turning her back on the crowd, Rishe contemplated her next move.\n\u201cWait, Lady Rishe!\u201d Mary\u2019s voice rang out.\n\u201cThat\u2019s right. You\u2019re not going anywhere, Rishe!\u201d The prince joined her. \u201cYou won\u2019t get away with treating me like trash to relieve your own injured heart.\u201d\n\u201cUgh, enough already!\u201d Rishe\u2019s patience was fraying. \u201cI don\u2019t have anything else to say to you. Goodbye!\u201d\n\u201cKnights, stop her!\u201d\nReluctantly, the knights moved to tail Rishe as she walked briskly back down the path. She sympathized with them, but she wasn\u2019t about to let them keep her here. Rounding a corner, she sensed something uncanny. She stopped, the knights quickly catching up with her.\n\u201cMy apologies, Lady Rishe. If you could please remain for just a\u2014whoa!\u201d\nRishe grabbed the hilt of the knight\u2019s sword. Yanking it from his belt, she spun around and stood at the ready. Metal rang against metal as Rishe parried a blow. She glared at her would-be attacker as he stepped out of the shadows.\nArnold Hein!\n\u201cWell, what do you know.\u201d The man smiling so sweetly while their swords locked was the very man who had ended her life. \u201cYou do have some skill.\u201d\nMetal screeched and slid, before Arnold sheathed his sword. Rishe lowered hers. Neither looked away.\n\u201cWho the hell are you?\u201d demanded one of the knights.\n\u201cStand down, good sirs,\u201d Rishe said. \u201cYour interference will only make this worse.\u201d\nThis mostly served to befuddle the knights further. Rishe absolutely couldn\u2019t allow them to come to blows with the crown prince of a friendly nation. And they couldn\u2019t beat him\u2014not even if they took him all at once. Rishe had blocked his blow, but her arm was completely numb. To think he\u2019d be even more powerful in five years.\nHe regarded her unabashedly. \u201cRishe, was that your name? Where did you learn such swordsmanship?\u201d",
    "query_text": "\n\u201cI\u2019m afraid I cannot say. Besides, you were clearly going easy on me.\u201d\n\u201cHa! You could tell?\u201d\nArnold\u2019s manner was throwing her off. He seemed to be enjoying himself. He\u2019s laughing. This monstrous prince is\u2026actually laughing.\nWhen she had met him in her other life, he was cold and merciless, like a genuine monster. And yet here he stood, mellow and smiling.\nThe Emperor Arnold Hein I knew was twenty-four years old, so he\u2019s, what? Nineteen now? This is so weird. He\u2019s grinning like a boy getting into a scrape.\nThat attack had been good-natured as well, almost playful. It had muscle behind it but certainly not any lethal intent. He\u2019d just wanted to force Rishe to catch the blow. She found it unbelievable that he could exude such an overpowering air of menace when he was just messing around.\nWhile Rishe"

    "prefix_text": " \nHer previous life was her sixth. Disguised as a man, Rishe rose as a warrior of an island country she came upon in her travels. It was a conventional yet charming kingdom formed of red brick. After striking up a friendship with a group of knights who didn\u2019t realize she was a woman, Rishe followed their advice and joined them.\nThe training was grueling enough to make her wish she were dead. Back when she had lived as a noble, she\u2019d learned how to wield a sword for basic self-defense, but training as a noble lady had in no way prepared her for this. She drilled relentlessly, barely taking the time to sleep. Just as she became a full-fledged knight, Emperor Arnold\u2019s forces lay siege to the castle.\n \n***\n \nHow could this happen? \nIn her seventh life, Rishe wearily sank into her chair. Across from her sat Arnold, his legs crossed and chin propped up on his hand, watching her lazily.\n\u201cWhat\u2019s the matter?\u201d he asked. \u201cYou seem unhappy.\u201d\n\u201cYou could say that.\u201d Even her voice was grumpy. Still, she couldn\u2019t very well tell him it was because she bore a grudge from a previous life. After the first time her life rewound to that pivotal moment, she\u2019d resolved to keep her loops a secret. \u201cI had plans for my exile. A brand-new life. And now because of you, my parents are involved. Even the king has heard about it!\u201d\nAfter Rishe rejected Arnold, Dietrich had immediately cried out, \u201cTh-the crown prince of Galkhein proposed to Rishe?!\u201d\nHis shrieks were loud enough to attract the attention of the master and mistress of the manor.\nWhen her parents came out, Rishe had protested, \u201cI\u2019m not going to marry him! I\u2019m leaving the country just as Dietrich commanded.\u201d\nNo one listened. Their faces just paled with nervous confusion.\nJust then, a glittering coach arrived. Half-stuck in the mud, the man inside it was forced to trudge over the swampy ground, and so the king of Hermity himself arrived, staggering and dirt-stained. \nHe grabbed hold of his son\u2019s collar, pushing him into a low bow. He then turned to Prince Arnold and said, rather loudly, \u201cYour Highness! Allow me to apologize for my son\u2019s foolishness! You are an esteemed guest all the way from Galkhein! It is unthinkable he would not offer you the courtesy you are due!\u201d\n\u201cYou\u2019re hurting me, Father! My back!\u201d\nThe king then turned to Rishe. \u201cMy lady, allow me to sincerely apologize as both a king and a father. My son\u2019s behavior toward you has been utterly disgraceful. I beg you to please give Prince Arnold\u2019s proposal due consideration. Not only for your own sake but for the sake of your country.\u201d\nThe king bowed to her as deeply as his son had to Arnold, and her parents joined him. Rishe felt dizzy at the sight of this abject debasement in the presence of citizens.\nArnold, who had been watching the proceedings with a detached amusement, sobered and stepped toward the king. \u201cYour Majesty, please rise.\u201d\nWithout the smirk, Arnold\u2019s face immediately reverted to its cold mask. The king didn\u2019t move. Maybe something in Arnold\u2019s voice kept him frozen.\n\u201cSuch a trifle won\u2019t cause discord between our kingdoms,\u201d he went on. \u201cHowever, I would beg a little time to speak with Lady Rishe.\u201d\nLater, Rishe would learn that Arnold\u2019s attendant had spoken to the king\u2019s own gentleman, certain that his words would reach their target. \u201cMy master took such trouble to attend these festivities, and this is the welcome he is offered? I wonder, what will the emperor think when he learns of his son\u2019s slighting at your nation\u2019s hands?\u201d\n\u201cIf you would, Lady Rishe?\u201d The plump king looked to be on the verge of tears.\nRishe had no obligation to accept and no desire to spend a moment longer in this country than was absolutely necessary. But acquiescence seemed the fastest way to move things along.\nAs her mind whirled, Arnold leaned in to whisper, \u201cIf you refuse to hear my suit, you won\u2019t deter me. I\u2019ll simply move on to Plan B.\u201d\nAnd that was how she found herself in one of the palace\u2019s parlors, here to \u201cjust talk\u201d to Prince Arnold. The ball guests were all gone. It was just the two of them.\n\u201cI want to know what you\u2019re planning,\u201d Rishe said flatly.\n\u201cPlanning? Me?\u201d\n\u201cBy asking me to marry you. You don\u2019t know me. A proposal like this wouldn\u2019t come out of the blue.\u201d\nThis man was destined to become an aggressive warmonger over the next few years. He wouldn\u2019t do anything without a dozen motives.\nPrince Arnold just smiled. \u201cI have no plans. I\u2019m simply enamored with you.\u201d\n\u201cEnamored\u2026?\u201d\nThat was the last thing she\u2019d expected him to say. Asking him to elaborate didn\u2019t seem worth the breath\u2014he was obviously lying. As if this ruthless, inhuman creature with ice in his veins could feel even a flicker of affection.\n\u201cWhy refuse me?\u201d Arnold asked. \u201cYour engagement is broken, you\u2019re on the verge of exile, and you have no faction or supporters. At this rate, you\u2019ll be dead within a fortnight. I\u2019d call my offer a stroke of unbelievable fortune.\u201d\n\u201cYou\u2019re not wrong,\u201d Rishe admitted. \u201cOnce upon a time, I would have jumped at your offer.\u201d\nIf it had been made in her first life, for instance. But now Rishe knew better. Her life was only just getting started, and the future held endless possibilities. After the horror of her sixth loop, she yearned for freedom.\nI don\u2019t want to marry him. I won\u2019t be anyone\u2019s captive. Still\u2026\nRishe, more than anyone, knew that the slightest adjustment could enact profound changes on the trajectory of a life. No doubt she\u2019d have many more lives, but this could be the only one where marriage to Arnold would be an option.\nThe dread emperor. The tyrant. The man who will stoke the fires of war. \nRishe knew the gossip, the endless conjecture behind Arnold Hein\u2019s bloody reign, but she didn\u2019t know the truth.\nWhy? The question had haunted her since her first life. She\u2019d never before had the chance to even speak to him.\nShe had wondered it as a merchant, hearing of the distant outbreak of war. She\u2019d wondered when the news of the dead and dying reached her apothecary. When she had comforted her terrified mistress in her life as a maid, assuring her everything would be all right. When she squared off against him in battle, as he plunged a sword through her heart\u2014even then she wondered. \nIf I stick around, maybe I\u2019ll finally have my answer. Half of her was dying to know. The other half didn\u2019t give a damn. And yet\u2026\nShe recalled a childhood dream. Rather, a longing.\nRishe let out a breath. \u201cYou claim you are enamored with me.\u201d\n\u201cYes. I am completely under your spell.\u201d\nTo think he could spout such nonsense with a straight face!\n\u201cThen will you grant me anything I desire?\u201d\n\u201cSo long as it is within my power,\u201d Arnold said. \u201cAnything you want will be yours.\u201d\nRishe hesitated, gathering her thoughts. \u201cI have some conditions.\u201d Arnold silently motioned for her to go on. \u201cI want full control over the wedding festivities. Everything must be procured through merchants of my choosing.\u201d\n\u201cFine.\u201d Arnold nodded. \u201cYou\u2019re free to do business with whomever you wish.\u201d\n\u201cAfter we are married, I must be in a position to mingle with guests from abroad.\u201d\n\u201cThat sounds within the purview of the crown princess. Anything else?\u201d\n\u201cI will be allowed to live in a separate residence from your mother and father.\u201d\nShe meant this seriously, but it made Arnold laugh. \u201cYou don\u2019t seem the type to worry about an overbearing mother-in-law.\u201d\n\u201cYou would be surprised. Combative relationships with one\u2019s new family are the most difficult part of marriage, or so they say. It could be a ramshackle cottage for all I care\u2014I just require a secondary residence.\u201d\nActually, Rishe didn\u2019t care at all about in-laws. When Arnold set his war into motion, his first move would be the assassination of his father. A genuine coup by patricide, not at all like Dietrich\u2019s clumsy attempt. Next, he would name himself emperor, take control of the country, and mobilize the military.\nSeparating him from his parents will make the first step more difficult\u2014although not impossible, unfortunately.\n\u201cAnything else?\u201d Arnold asked. \u201cI\u2019ll do whatever it takes to marry you.\u201d\n\u201cIdeally, I\u2019d like to know your endgame,\u201d Rishe said with dignity. \u201cBut as I doubt there\u2019s any chance of that, I have one final request.\u201d She jabbed a finger into his face, regardless of how rude it was. \u201cI will spend my time idling around the castle. No work, no study. I shall be utterly useless.\u201d\nLet\u2019s see just how much you want me as your princess.\nAfter a long moment of silence, Arnold cracked a merry laugh. The proposal remained; all her conditions were met.\n\n(2) chapter number given is likely out of range: 0\nChapter: 7\n\nChapter 2\nChapter 2\n \n\u201cYOU KNOW, it was only after I went into commerce that I truly had a dream for the future,\u201d Rishe had once confided in a friend. \u201cUp until then, I existed only as the crown prince\u2019s fianc\u00e9e or my father\u2019s daughter. My every act was to become more worthy of that status. But now, for the first time, I actually have a goal of my own.\u201d\n\u201cOh, yeah?\u201d her friend said. He was the ruler of the desert kingdom, and his smile was awfully charming. \u201cWhat\u2019s that?\u201d\nRishe smiled back. \u201cI want to travel to every single country in the world. I want to see everything in every town, peruse their markets, and meet the eyes of every person who lives there!\u201d\nBy now, that felt like such a distant dream.\n \n***\n \nRishe awoke with a start, eyes snapping open as she sensed a disturbance in the air.\nShe unsheathed her sword halfway, primed for danger. \nInside the coach, her old enemy sat across from her, one hand outstretched. \u201cWhat do you think you\u2019re doing?\u201d she demanded.\nWhen they\u2019d boarded the coach, Rishe had warned him not to lay a single finger on her throughout the trip to his kingdom. Ordering the prince not to touch his consort was absurd, but Arnold readily agreed. He had, after all, promised to follow her every direction.\nAnd yet, here he was, already breaking his promise.\nArnold appeared unperturbed by her glare. \u201cDon\u2019t look at me like that. I was merely trying to recover what you took from me.\u201d\nConfused, Rishe looked at the sword in her hand. It had a black lacquered scabbard with a simple golden decoration. Engraved on the hilt was the Galkhein crest.\n\u201cOh!\u201d Rishe thrust the sword back at Arnold. \u201cMy apologies.\u201d\nArnold chuckled. \u201cYou caught me off guard. You were nodding off, and then you suddenly snatched up my sword. You looked quite content snuggling up with it.\u201d\nArnold propped the sword beside him. Rishe pressed a hand to her chest to quell her racing heart. The sword that gutted me in my previous life is now my bedmate. What a world. Her recent stint as a knight had left her ill at ease without a blade at hand. She just couldn\u2019t believe it was Arnold\u2019s she\u2019d reached for.\n\u201cI didn\u2019t mean to disturb you, but I doubted sleeping with a weapon would be comfortable. I\u2019m impressed you sensed my intent before I even touched you.\u201d Arnold rested one elbow against the window frame, watching her with shameless fascination. \u201cOne only develops instincts like that from combat training. And you were also a member of the court? How in the world did you find the time?\u201d\nRishe shrugged. She couldn\u2019t just say, I pretended to be a man in a previous life, that\u2019s how.\n\u201cI assume there\u2019s more to you than your devotion to the sword. You seem to like flowers.\u201d\nShe followed Arnold\u2019s gaze to where she\u2019d bundled a small bouquet in a handkerchief. This was their fifth day on the road to Galkhein. Every day, without fail, she\u2019d picked flowers whenever they stopped to water the horses. The ones from today were still fresh, but the ones she\u2019d begun drying five days ago were just about ready.\n\u201cI didn\u2019t pick these because they\u2019re pretty.\u201d Rishe brought the blooms to her face, spirits rising at their sweet scent. Spring wildflowers had a soft and gentle smell. Rishe looked out the window at the forest spreading toward Galkhein, thinking of the rare native flowers going into bloom. She wished she could pick those as well, but that would cause too much delay. She gazed on wistfully.\nAfter watching her in silence for some time, Arnold said, \u201cBy the way, I sent one of my men ahead on a fast horse to deliver your order to the company you requested. They\u2019ll be invited to Galkhein to discuss the wedding ceremony.\u201d\n\u201cThank you,\u201d Rishe said. \u201cI\u2019m glad you kept your word.\u201d\n\u201cThe Aria Trading Company,\u201d Arnold mused. \u201cI\u2019ve heard of them. They\u2019re up-and-comers, aren\u2019t they? Have you done business with them before?\u201d\n\u201cNo, but I heard from a friend that they hold a very high standard of quality.\u201d\nRishe was pleasantly surprised at how easily Arnold had acceded to her request. Typically, a royal household had their own personal dealer. Getting them to do business with someone else could be difficult.\nI want to establish a connection with Aria as soon as possible, Rishe thought. It was, of course, the company that had taken her in during her first life.\nThe company had been established just two years prior to picking her up by its owner, a man named Tully. They were still in their growth stage, but in just a few years, they would be the grandest trading company in all the world. They\u2019d proven a great boon in her life as an apothecary as well, helping to distribute her newest medicines. She\u2019d struggled to win their trust initially, but she pledged to work much harder this time around.\nThis marriage isn\u2019t going to happen\u2014I need an escape plan for when it all falls apart. I must bring to bear all my knowledge and influence as a crown princess.\nRishe didn\u2019t know Arnold\u2019s plans, but she had no intention of sitting around and waiting for him to use her as he pleased. She\u2019d spend her time as his consort wisely. Everything must serve her ultimate goal: to live longer than five years, and live well.\nHer fierce determination must have shown on her face because Arnold gave her a little bemused smile. \u201cYes?\u201d\nGod! Rishe grimaced at that flawlessly handsome countenance. Such beauty, possessed by such powerful destruction. The fact that he\u2019d been the man to kill her did nothing to lessen her fascination. In fact, it almost made it worse. The study of contrasts.\n\u201cSorry, I just\u2014\u201d\nShe was interrupted by the horses\u2019 loud whinnies.\n\u201cStop! Hey, stop the coach!\u201d\nShouts drifted back from conveyance ahead of theirs, which contained the luggage and attendants. The squadron of knights tailing the column of coaches sped off toward the front.\n\u201cWho do you think you\u2014graaargh!\u201d\nThat didn\u2019t sound good. Rishe moved to climb out, but Arnold was faster. He drew his sword.\n\u201cHey!\u201d\nArnold locked the door from the outside. \u201cStay hidden.\u201d\nWhy is he putting himself in danger? That\u2019s what knights are for! The fact that Rishe had been about to do the same thing didn\u2019t occur to her. It\u2019s probably bandits. He told me to stay hidden in here, but I\u2019m not so sure about that.\nArnold had left her locked in from the outside, hoping to keep her safe, but Rishe didn\u2019t like her odds. There were five coaches, but this one was certainly the grandest. It locked on the inside as well, but that wouldn\u2019t stop someone with enough determination. If she did as she was told, she\u2019d just be waiting patiently for a bandit to break a window and drag her out.\nKeeping one eye on the coachmen fleeing into the forest, Rishe began a methodical search for something to help her. Right\u2014her hairpin!\nThis sure brings me back. She unfastened it, twisting it into the gap in the door. Back when I was a maid, my lady would lock herself in her chambers all the time to avoid her studies. I had to break her out just like this.\nThe lock on the coach was simple, and it came open easily. Once she was free, she scanned her surroundings. She didn\u2019t see anyone who looked immediately hostile, but there was noise up ahead. Cautiously, she headed toward it.\nBefore long, she found Arnold.\nWow.\nRoughly ten men\u2014the bandits, she presumed\u2014lay crumpled on the ground. In their midst stood Arnold, in the process of tripping another man into the dirt. He scowled, blade at the man\u2019s throat. \u201cIs that it, then?\u201d\n\u201cGwugh!\u201d\nArnold kicked the bandit in the stomach, eyes blazing with cruelty. \u201cThat\u2019s all the thrill you offer me after I went to the trouble of drawing my sword? Barely worth it. I\u2019m bored already.\u201d\nHe wasn\u2019t angry; on the contrary, he stared his enemies down with chilly disappointment, as if this had all been a letdown. Even Arnold\u2019s own knights seemed terrified of their master when he was in a mood. Arnold smoothly flicked the blood",
    "query_text": " off his sword, wiping the blade on the bandit\u2019s shirt before sheathing it. The rest of the men on the ground seemed to be unconscious.\nWait, he didn\u2019t kill anyone? Why not? Is it because we haven\u2019t reached Galkhein?\nShe supposed even Arnold knew better than to go around"

    "prefix_text": " the solution.\u201d Arnold gazed down at Rishe\u2019s hands. \u201cThe part I\u2019m struggling with is why you\u2019re the one telling me this.\u201d\n\u201cWell, I know how to make the antidote,\u201d Rishe said patiently as she muddled the herbs together in the white soup bowl she\u2019d borrowed for her flowers. She crushed them with the back of a spoon before adding another dried flower, crushing that as well, and combining them to form a paste. This process would be easier with a pestle, but she wasn\u2019t about to complain. \u201cThis poison is common\u2014it\u2019s cheap and easy to make, which often means the antidote is simple as well.\u201d\nThe antidote was synthesized, in fact, when hunters witnessed a deer showing no symptoms after eating a certain mushroom. They tested those along with other common herbs the deer ate. Rishe mentally thanked them for their scientific rigor as she added a bit of water, straining it all through a cloth.\nRishe stood up, brandishing the bowl of bright green medicine. \u201cBoiling would make the antidote more potent, but this works in a pinch.\u201d\nThat was when she noticed the astonished stares. Unsure of what social faux paus she\u2019d perpetrated, she looked away. Oliver was completely stunned. Arnold looked thoughtful. It was imperative the knights were treated as soon as possible, but to Rishe\u2019s dismay, no one was moving. \nDo they not trust me? That makes sense. Anyone would be reluctant to use medicine concocted by a complete stranger. But the longer we wait, the harder the poison will become to cure. \nShe needed to dispel their doubts. Rolling up her sleeve, Rishe approached Arnold and drew his sword from its scabbard. \u201cI need to borrow this for a moment, Your Highness.\u201d\n\u201cWhat are you\u2014\u201d\nShe pushed the blade against the soft skin of her inner arm. Blood welled up, along with the sharp sting of pain. Nothing compared to her injuries sustained during her life as a knight, though.\nArnold did not share her nonchalance. \u201cWhat do you think you\u2019re doing?!\u201d\nHe grabbed for her arm. She stepped out of his grasp. Was blood truly so shocking? She didn\u2019t have the time to worry about it. Clutching the overfull bowl, Rishe hurried back to the knights.\n\u201cDon\u2019t worry. This isn\u2019t poison,\u201d Rishe said. She demonstrated as much by drizzling it with a spoon over her own fresh wound. It stung. That meant the ingredients were working.\n\u201cThis is crushed liquori grass, luqua flowers, and carilya nuts. I\u2019ll swallow some if that\u2019s what it takes to prove it\u2019s safe.\u201d It was horribly bitter; she hoped it wouldn\u2019t come to that. \u201cThe paralysis will last for days. Please make up your mind quickly.\u201d\n\u201cMake up our mind?\u201d\n\u201cWill you allow me to cure the poison? Or would you rather drag paralyzed soldiers all the way to Galkhein? I suppose you could waste His Highness\u2019s time searching for a hunter\u2019s settlement to use their antidote.\u201d She smiled serenely. \u201cIt makes no difference to us. Right, Your Highness?\u201d\nIn the end, Rishe applied the antidote.\nThe recovery took a few hours. While they waited, Rishe picked herbs in the same meadow she\u2019d been gazing at with yearning from the carriage. A fortuitous turn of events. She found anti-inflammatory herbs and flowers to ease sour bellies, ingredients for curing headaches, and mushrooms for inducing slumber. She wrapped them all up in a handkerchief.\nIn the meantime, Arnold dispatched a messenger to this region\u2019s lord, making arrangements to deliver the apprehended bandits. After coordinating with Oliver, he drifted over to Rishe.\n\u201cI see your interest in flowers is mercenary, rather than ornamental,\u201d he said, surveying the heaps of herbs gathered on the bank of the pond. He sat down beside her.\nWhen he didn\u2019t say anything more, Rishe went back to work plucking leaves from plants with valuable stems. The leaves had no medicinal effects, but they did make a decent broth. Slumber mushroom spores were a nuisance unless dried; they were spread out beside her in the sun.\nI wonder, would he be annoyed if I attached herbs to the roof of the coach? That would be unusual adornment for a crown prince\u2019s retinue, but it wouldn\u2019t hurt to ask.\nShe realized, quite suddenly, that Arnold was looking at her. At her hands, specifically. He sat cross-legged with his chin propped on his fist, staring absently, like a kid watching a column of ants march by.\nWhat is so fascinating about herbs?\nTheir eyes met. \u201cAm I bothering you?\u201d he asked.\nRishe shook her head slowly. \u201cNot at all. I was just curious what caught your eye.\u201d\n\u201cNothing specific. I was just thinking how very unusual you are.\u201d He was smiling again. \u201cI\u2019m looking forward to how you\u2019ll surprise me next.\u201d\nLike I\u2019m some sort of rare pet he bought to entertain him. She didn\u2019t like that. Nothing she\u2019d done was at all remarkable\u2014normal tasks performed by a normal person.\n\u201cI didn\u2019t make that antidote for your amusement.\u201d\n\u201cI realize that.\u201d The instigating smile faded from his lips. \u201cYou know, those knights you coerced into taking your home-brewed medicine were all born in the slums.\u201d\n\u201cCoerced? That\u2019s hardly the word I\u2019d use.\u201d\n\u201cGalkhein claims to value merit above all else, but in the end, people are judged by where they came from. Despite this, those men fought their way up from nothing.\u201d\nRishe paused in plucking the seeds from a flower and looked up at Arnold.\n\u201cThe men with the worst cases of the paralysis were all newly assigned. They\u2019ve spent weeks training to ensure this mission was a success. That older knight\u2014the one who bowed to you\u2014sustained an injury protecting the rookies. He cares deeply about his men.\u201d\n\u201cYou seem to care about them too,\u201d Rishe commented.\n\u201cI handpicked them for my retinue.\u201d Arnold clambered to his feet, only to fall into a bow. \u201cAnd you kept them safe. You have my deepest gratitude.\u201d\nRishe found herself at a loss for words. Was this Arnold putting on a mask to hide the monster within? Or was this the real him? She remembered the way he\u2019d looked when he held his blade to the bandit\u2019s throat, like a child poised to break a toy he had grown bored of.\n\u201cDon\u2019t mention it,\u201d Rishe said, uncomfortable. \u201cI knew how to do it, so I did.\u201d\nArnold laughed softly. \u201cBe that as it may, I\u2019d still count a noblewoman who can brew remedies from wildflowers by the side of the road",
    "query_text": " a rare find.\u201d\n\u201cEarlier, when you grabbed my wrist\u2026\u201d Rishe steered the subject away from her incongruous knowledge. \u201cYou broke your promise. You said you wouldn\u2019t touch me.\u201d\n\u201cThat was reflex,\u201d Arnold protested. \u201cI thought you were going to hurt yourself.\u201d\nSuch a simple"

This isn\u2019t my fault.\u201d An indignant flush crept over the redhead\u2019s face. \u201cThere\u2019s no way some upstart can tell what time it\u2019s going to rain! The weather is going to be fantastic all day. Come on, we\u2019re hauling these over to the wash!\u201d\nThe three girls meekly followed Diana.\nRishe sighed, turning to the blonde girl. \u201cAre you hurt?\u201d\n\u201cNo, I\u2019m fine.\u201d The girl\u2019s gaze darted around nervously. \u201cI\u2019m Elsie. Thank you for helping me.\u201d Her face was studiously blank, but from the way she struggled with her words, Rishe could tell she was being genuine.\n\u201cDon\u2019t worry about it,\u201d Rishe said. \u201cYour uniform seems to have fared less well.\u201d\n\u201cOh no.\u201d Elsie looked down at herself. Her face remained vacant, but she seemed sad. \u201cAnd I just got it.\u201d \n\u201cYou can get the dirt out if you wash it straight away. It\u2019s going to rain, but this dress should dry quickly. Use lots of soap, but don\u2019t scrub it by hand\u2014scrape the mud off with a brush.\u201d\n\u201cWhy a brush?\u201d\n\u201cBecause your fingers will just grind dirt into the threads. A brush is more porous.\u201d\nThe young sons of the family Rishe served spent their time tumbling in the dirt, and she had plenty of experience scraping mud out of clothes. She could even salvage dirty socks that had spent days crumpled in the corner.\n\u201cDo you\u2026 Are you\u2026\u201d Elsie trailed off, blinking rapidly a couple of times before finally looking Rishe in the eyes. \u201cAre you the crown princess\u2019s maid?\u201d\nUnsure how to answer, Rishe couldn\u2019t meet her eyes.\n \n***\n \nAfter parting ways with Elsie, Rishe returned to the detached wing with her fresh water. She put clean sheets on the bed the knights had installed, satisfied that she had a comfortable place to sleep. This room also had the highest-up balcony in the whole detached palace.\nTaking a break, she wandered out onto the balcony and looked off over the capital, the golden afternoon tinged with the onset of twilight. The day was fresh with a recent rain, the air clear enough to see for miles. The spring breeze felt good against her skin, sweaty from cleaning. Rishe leaned against the railing, leaning her head back and closing her eyes.\nShe felt like collapsing into bed immediately, but she desperately needed a wash. Still, she didn\u2019t want to pull herself away from the view and the breeze just yet. When she resumed gazing out absentmindedly, something her mother once said drifted back to her. \n\u201cRishe, there is no need for you to think for yourself.\u201d\nShe frowned, the memories coming thick and fast now.\n\u201cYou mustn\u2019t forget that the duty of our family is to live our lives fully devoted to the kings of the land. You\u2019re smart, but all the thinking in the world won\u2019t do a woman any good. You need only concern yourself with how best to serve the crown prince.\u201d\n\u201cStudies? Focus on social etiquette\u2014that\u2019s what you need for navigating high society. The crown prince\u2019s bride must be flawless. Your smile is lacking. You must always strive to appear amiable.\u201d\nRishe breathed out a long sigh. When I was fifteen, their lectures were the only thing I thought about.\nHer parents preached constantly. \u201cA woman\u2019s true happiness is to marry a suitable man and give birth to his heirs.\u201d\n\u201cBut, Mother\u2026\u201d\nObjection was not permitted. Any argument was immediately dispensed with. As a woman, Rishe could not inherit her father\u2019s title. Her only value was in her marriage. \nDespite knowing now that the opinions of others were as worthless as empty titles, the words still echoed in her memories.\nRishe\u2019s fingertips twitched, and she opened her eyes. Unmoving, she said, \u201cShouldn\u2019t you be seeing to your duties?\u201d\n\u201cMore hidden depths, I see,\u201d came a voice tinged with pleasure. Rishe straightened and turned. There was Arnold, leaning against the door to the balcony. \u201cYou seem able to sense my approach no matter how far or how hard I try.\u201d\n\u201cYou\u2019re quite naughty, aren\u2019t you? You\u2019ve been making your presence known little by little, emanating threat, to see how quickly I catch on.\u201d\n\u201cSo you noticed that as well.\u201d Arnold joined Rishe on the balcony. She tensed, but all he did was cast a curious glance at the view. \u201cWhat were you looking at?\u201d\n\u201cThe city.\u201d Rishe was hardly going to tell him she\u2019d been looking at nothing, merely ruminating on her mother\u2019s overbearing advice. The view from the balcony was spectacular, though. \u201cWhat\u2019s that over there?\u201d\n\u201cYou mean the library? The state invested funds to expand it. We have books from all over the world.\u201d\n\u201cReally? You have a library that big?\u201d Rishe\u2019s eyes sparkled with delight. She pointed out another building. \u201cWhat about that spire? It\u2019s beautiful.\u201d\n\u201cThe church and clock tower. The bells ring out the hour.\u201d\n\u201cOoh, how wonderful! And it looks like there\u2019s a rather big market there too?\u201d\n\u201cYes, the largest market in the city. Carts line up in the early morning. Most of the offerings are made fresh every day.\u201d\n\u201cAmazing! And what about that pretty mountain over there?\u201d\nRishe tried and failed to contain her excitement. She couldn\u2019t help but imagine what seeing all these places up close would be like. The grand library, the beautiful church that told the time, and the morning market with fresh, delicious food\u2014she wanted to experience it all.\nSeeing Arnold\u2019s bemused face, she said, \u201cWhat?\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m just wondering where all this interest is coming from,\u201d he said. \u201cYou were so reluctant to come, yet here you are, brimming with curiosity for my city.\u201d\n\u201cWell\u2026\u201d she trailed off, unsure of how to respond.\nWhat should I say? Should I just tell him the truth?\nThis wasn\u2019t a secret, but talking about her hopes and dreams to the man who had killed her was a little awkward. A strange self-consciousness settled on her, her cheeks heating as she mumbled, \u201cBecause I\u2019ve always wanted to.\u201d\nArnold looked at her keenly. \u201cWanted to what?\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019ve always wanted to come here.\u201d\nDuring her life as a merchant, Rishe developed",

That dream was cut tragically short when only one country remained: Galkhein.\nIn each of her consecutive lives, Rishe\u2019s priority became staying alive.

Rishe, who hadn\u2019t recovered from seeing Arnold\u2019s beautiful face at close range, barely noticed the looks of utter loathing the assembled women were throwing her.\n\u201cH-His Highness is smiling? At his hostage bride?\u201d\n\u201cHe called her his wife?! He\u2019s never even looked at us!\u201d\nThey were whispers, but they carried.\nA portly man stepped forward with his daughter in tow. \u201cYour Highness, do you mean to say that this lovely young woman is your fianc\u00e9e?\u201d\nEvery eye in the ballroom was on Rishe, alight with curiosity, envy, or schemes. None of them could hide their contempt. But Rishe didn\u2019t falter.\nThis is nothing compared to being publicly dumped in a banquet hall. And I\u2019ve done that seven times!\nShe offered a polite smile and an astoundingly correct curtsy. Left leg at a diagonal behind the right, back straight, head bowed. \u201cHow do you do? My name is Rishe Irmgard Weitzner.\u201d\nEven the most hostile guests could find nothing impolite in her greeting, no sign of rough manners from the rustic daughter of a backwater nation. Rishe had years of training in expectation of ascending to the throne. Occasionally, habits from her other lives slipped through, but Arnold appeared to be the only one who noticed.\nNow he was looking at her with satisfaction. \u201cLady Rishe has only just arrived, and her acquaintances are few and far between. I hope I can count on you all to hold me accountable should I prove an incompetent husband.\u201d\n\u201cB-but of course, Your Highness.\u201d\n\u201cCome, Rishe.\u201d Arnold guided her out of the ring of spectators. The stares continued to follow them as they walked away.\nRishe dropped her voice to a whisper. \u201cYou sure know how to invite the ire of women.\u201d\n\u201cWhatever do you mean?\u201d\n\u201cThe way you harped on about me. Everything you said was tailor-made to stoke their jealousy. You\u2019ve gained me enemies, so thanks for that.\u201d\nArnold snorted. \u201cEverything I said was to protect you from enemies. They need to know you aren\u2019t just some trophy they can eliminate without recourse. We need to show them this to forestall any potential moves against you in the future.\n\u201cShow them what, exactly?\u201d\n\u201cThat I\u2019ll protect you no matter what.\u201d\nHe said it with such nonchalance that it brought her up short. Protect me? Arnold Hein, protect me?\nSuch an ironic position to take. She couldn\u2019t tell him that, of course. Her response came out somewhat strangled. \u201cI doubt they\u2019ll be anything to worry about. In fact, the biggest threat facing me is you.\u201d\n\u201cOh? And why do you say that?\u201d\n\u201cFor many reasons, the most obvious being that I\u2019m no match for you with a blade.\u201d As much as it pained her to admit it.\nArnold looked pleased. \u201cPerhaps we should duel.\u201d\n\u201cYes, please! And if it wouldn\u2019t be an intrusion\u2014I would like to train with you.\u201d If she studied him, she could learn his strategies and his attack patterns. She\u2019d never be a match in speed or raw power, but any insight would be invaluable.\n\u201cSure.\u201d Arnold shrugged. \u201cI don\u2019t mind.\u201d\n\u201cTruly?\u201d Her eyes glittered with anticipation.\nHe chuckled. \u201cYour answers never disappoint me.\u201d\n\u201cWhat\u2019s that supposed to mean? Oh, it looks like they\u2019re playing a new song.\u201d\nA soft melody drifted across the hall. The crowd divided, heading toward the center of the floor or against the wall. The next dance was starting, and everyone was waiting to see what the crown prince and his new fianc\u00e9e would do.\n\u201cWe don\u2019t have to dance if you don\u2019t want to,\u201d Arnold said.\n\u201cOh? As it happens, I like dancing.\u201d Plus, she couldn\u2019t resist a blatant challenge. She offered him her hand.\n\u201cVery well, then.\u201d Arnold only hesitated for a moment before taking it and steering her gently to an empty spot on the floor. He didn\u2019t seem like the dancing type, but his movements were slick and effortless. Facing one another, they joined hands. Arnold wrapped his other arm around her waist. \nOoh. His hand felt huge against her back. She realized she was breathing a little faster. They\u2019d never been this close before.\nNo, that isn\u2019t quite true. This is the second time. Rishe\u2019s final memories from her last life flashed vividly through her mind.\nThis was indeed the second time they had been this close\u2014the first had ended with a sword through her chest.\nEmperor Arnold Hein had single-handedly decimated the knights in the castle. Rishe stood in the midst of the carnage, breath ragged as she gripped the hilt of her sword, slick with her own blood. She was the last line of defense. The chamber behind her housed the royal family.\nIf they could reach the hidden passageways, the young prince and his party could find shelter with their allies across the border. Rishe and the other knights were prepared to sacrifice their lives to allow the royal family to survive. Their escape meant victory.\nBells tolled out, urging flight. All is lost. Run. Rishe managed to graze Arnold\u2019s cheek with her blade before she looked down to find his jet-black sword blooming out of her chest.\nShe remembered how it burned, as if the blade was made of fire. It was heat, not pain, but her breathing grew labored, and when Emperor Arnold Hein withdrew his sword, Rishe crumpled. \nHe knelt by her side and whispered something.\nThe words were seared into her memory. Rishe squeezed Arnold\u2019s hand as they danced.\nI\u2019ll be the bully this time. \nRishe shifted her weight back, slipping out of the hold on her waist. She broke Arnold\u2019s lead and spun, drifting on the harmony of the dance. She took him by surprise; his eyes went wide.\nI wonder what you\u2019ll do when you\u2019re no longer on top, Your Highness. Her smile was a declaration of war. Watching him attempt to follow her lead would be delightful. She pulled his hand toward her, attempting to move them into a spin.\nBut Arnold held fast. He planted his hand on her waist and turned them in a different direction, using her inertia against her. Hey! As a result, Rishe twirled by herself on the spot.\nShe didn\u2019t miss a step. She turned elegantly, the hem of her dress whispering across the ballroom floor. She heard appreciative murmurs from the wallflowers lined up watching.\nDespite that, Rishe took it as a defeat. Round one to Arnold. \nSo\u2026you can think on your feet. How about this?\nArnold remained unruffled, evading her next scheme like it was nothing. He grinned down at her, his eyes shining with a dare.\nHe thinks I can\u2019t beat him. His ease vexed her, but it was his smugness that made her angry.\nShe let out a hard breath, attempting a maneuver to lure him in while turning. He leaned back, not falling for it at all.\nHe\u2019s just too good at changing his center of gravity! She kept her astonishment under wraps, but she felt it. Despite how close we\u2019re dancing, I can\u2019t throw off his timing at all. He\u2019s sidestepped all my attempts, and he takes back the lead the second I let down my guard!\nIt made her increasingly angry. She twirled and stepped as the dance dictated, all the while feeling out for moments of weakness. Arnold played along with her game, completely unruffled.\nEvery single time. I\u2019m doing my utmost to trip him up, but he doesn\u2019t even seem annoyed! At this point she\u2019d just settle for any reaction at all.\nTheir unusual dance style had gathered a crowd. Rishe paid them no mind, focused only on her goal. Then something occurred to her, and her breath caught in her throat.\nWait a minute, he has left an opening. It\u2019s the same one from before. She thought back to their fight to the death, to that moment when she had managed to draw blood. That may indeed have been his only weakness.\nIf I strike the same way\u2014huh? Before she could try, Arnold appeared to lose patience, wrapping his arm around her waist. He bent her back into a dip so deep it felt like he\u2019d pulled a carpet from under her feet. She yelped, grabbing at him reflexively, clinging tight. His big hands gripped her securely enough to mitigate the sensation of falling. Relief flooded through her, and she felt a laugh rumble against her ear.\nThe music came to an end with one last ringing note. She blinked. The dance is over?\nA hush fell over the ballroom. Then cheers broke out, followed by a round of applause.\n\u201cThat was incredible!\u201d\nThe watching nobles crowded in.\n\u201cYou two moved in such perfect harmony!\u201d\n\u201cI was on the edge of my seat. I felt like I was watching a sword duel!\u201d\n\u201cIs this a dance from Hermity? I\u2019ve never seen such steps before.\u201d\n\u201cUh, well\u2026\u201d Rishe floundered. She glanced up at Arnold, who appeared to be enjoying her struggle. She\u2019d get no help from him.\nRishe dealt with the barrage of questions as best she could, letting the crowd sweep them into the dining room, which was set up for a buffet-style meal. She made sure to greet every guest, riveting their faces into her memory.\nShe must have been acting peculiar, because Arnold eventually said, \u201cRishe, I think the wine is getting to you. Shall we get some fresh air?\u201d\nRishe hadn\u2019t touched a single drop. In fact, she\u2019d been caught up in so many conversations that she hadn\u2019t even had the chance to eat, but she had experience working on an empty stomach. She accepted Arnold\u2019s encouragement as the escape it was.\nJust when I least expect it, he\u2019ll act the gentleman. Maybe he\u2019d remembered her demand for a carefree life of doing nothing.\nRishe cast a charming look across the crowd. \u201cThank you for your consideration, Your Highness. Forgive me.\u201d She gave a polite bow before quietly slipping away. \nShe didn\u2019t head straight to the balcony but rather slowly walked around the hall. There was only so much she could find out glued to Arnold\u2019s side all night.\nI need information. Galkhein\u2019s political landscape was a mystery to me through all my past lives. I only know the rumors that made it abroad.\nAlthough she knew of Arnold\u2019s eventual patricide, she had no concept of the circumstances leading up to it. She needed a better picture of the factions and power balance inside the court. The lives these people led.\nI know better than to believe wartime gossip. This Arnold Hein is a lot different from what I\u2019d heard he was like at nineteen. He\u2019s not as diabolical as the rumors led me to believe. He likes to push, but he isn\u2019t unkind. The thought drifted across her mind, leaving her conflicted. Well, he\u2019s not unkind now. But I still don\u2019t like not knowing his motives. And he\u2019s a bit of a jerk, to be honest. \nShe tried to settle her mind and just observe. Gathering intelligence was necessary to lead a long, carefree life lazing around the palace.\nIf I recall correctly, that\u2019s Lord Hannawald. He seems to be on good terms with Count Gayle. Duke Hudemann and Duke Teinitz are having a friendly enough conversation, yet they don\u2019t seem close. Rishe ticked off the names of people she\u2019d met, committing them to memory.\nA wave of sweet perfume wafted over her. A pretty girl with soft blonde hair had appeared at her side. \u201cHow do you do, Lady Rishe? I\u2019m Cornelia Thea Toona.\u201d\nDuke Toona\u2019s family was the thirty-first house she\u2019d met tonight.\nRishe smiled graciously. \u201cRishe Irmgard Weitzner. A pleasure to meet you.\u201d\n\u201cThe pleasure is all mine.\u201d Cornelia smiled sweetly. Her eyes were big and bright, her lips full. She held a glass in each hand and offered one to Rishe. \u201cWine? I see you\u2019re empty-handed.\u201d\nA gaggle of other ladies nearby began giggling among themselves.\n\u201cHow dare she act so haughty when she\u2019s a captive. It\u2019s time for her learn just what she is. A pawn to be played and discarded.\u201d\n\u201cShe should enjoy her time on Prince Arnold\u2019s arm while she can.\u201d\n\u201cShe is from a minor nation, after all.\u201d\nAs Rishe took note of their whispers, Cornelia gazed at her with doe eyes.",

Not too long after, a man appeared where she had been standing.\nThe man turned a silent glare down into the garden, as if he\u2019d known the boy had been there the whole time, despite the shadows.\nA shiver ran down the boy\u2019s spine and he smiled reflexively, delighting in the intense aura of threat the man gave off. It was just a warning, it seemed, as the man abruptly turned on his heel and disappeared. \n\u201cAww, we can\u2019t play together either?\u201d The boy hung his head. \u201cI miss you, Brother.\u201d\nIt had to be the woman. The beauty. She\u2019d made the boy\u2019s life hell since the day she arrived. \nHis brother had prohibited him from attending balls like this one.

Still, he\u2019d wanted to meet that girl. \n\u201cBut we\u2019ll meet soon enough, won\u2019t we?\u201d He spoke to himself in a soft voice. \u201cI\u2019ve got plans for you, Sister.\u201d \n\n(2) chapter number given is likely out of range: 0\nChapter: 8\n\nChapter 3\nChapter 3\n \n\u201cYOU\u2019RE ALL SO USELESS!\u201d Diana the redheaded maid\u2019s voice rang out inside the stone washhouse. \nThree days had passed since the afternoon Rishe shook off her guard and came out to the well. Rishe was once again dressed to fit in with the maids. At Diana\u2019s shout, she looked up without pausing in her work. \n\u201cIs even laundry beyond your capabilities? I asked you to wash these this morning, and now it\u2019s past noon!

What still needs to be done?\u201d\n\u201cYou again?\u201d Diana rounded on Rishe. \u201cI don\u2019t know who you serve, but I\u2019m amazed you have the time to do other people\u2019s work. I wish I had so much free time.\u201d\nHuffily, she turned from Rishe. \u201cLet\u2019s just ignore these useless fools. Laura, Maya. Come on. If we want to be chosen as Lady Rishe\u2019s maids, we mustn\u2019t waste our time.\u201d\nDiana took out a slip of paper from her pocket, smoothing it out. \u201cIt looks like the new bedsheets for her palace will arrive today. We should inspect them to make sure everything is perfect!\u201d\n\u201cWait up, Diana!\u201d\nThe two maids followed Diana out. Rishe waited for the door to close before turning to Elsie and the others. \u201cLet\u2019s keep working. If there\u2019s anything too large and cumbersome, feel free to pass it over to me.\u201d\n\u201cTh-thank you so much!\u201d The new maids went weak with gratitude. One of them, a girl on the verge of tears, even fell into a full bow. Rishe muttered encouragement as she scrubbed some bedsheets.\nElsie, who was washing the sheets with her, wore a rueful look. \u201cI\u2019m so sorry for the trouble. We\u2019re just not learning fast enough.\u201d\n\u201cYou haven\u2019t been working here long, have you? It takes time to learn a new job, no matter who you are,\u201d Rishe said as she kept scrubbing. \u201cAnd it\u2019s not like you\u2019ve never washed a single thing in your life before, right?\u201d\nElsie nodded nervously. \nRishe had realized over the past few days doing the laundry that not all the newcomers were complete amateurs. They\u2019d obviously done chores at home, or something similar. When set a specific task, they could perform it properly, but Diana\u2019s complaints weren\u2019t unfounded. They did take far too much time with laundry.\nBut it\u2019s obvious why. \u201cDo you know anything about Diana?\u201d Rishe asked Elsie. \u201cLike, is she from a well-off family?\u201d\nElsie said, \u201cI heard that her father was a business owner. She worked with him.\u201d\n\u201cI heard that as well,\u201d added another maid. \u201cBut he fell into debt and had to sell off.\u201d \nRishe stopped scrubbing for a moment to consider this.\n\u201cUm, is something the matter?\u201d Elsie asked.\nRishe smiled and shook her head. \u201cNo, nothing. Let\u2019s just focus on getting these washed for the time being.\u201d\n \n***\n \nThat afternoon, thirty maids were assembled in the detached wing of the palace. Ten of them were old hands, long in service to the royal family, while the other twenty were freshly hired. The crown princess was to choose her maids from among these thirty. They wore their nerves plainly on their sleeves. \n\u201cHey, I thought this palace was in a terrible state of neglect,\u201d one maid whispered. \u201cWhy is it so sparkling clean?\u201d\n\u201cYeah, you\u2019re right,\u201d said another. \u201cSomeone must have sorted it out before we arrived.\u201d\n\u201cI wonder what kind of person Lady Rishe is. Ooh, I\u2019m so nervous.\u201d\nThe girls looked around anxiously.\n\u201cHey, Elsie, that girl who was always helping us isn\u2019t here.\u201d\nElsie blinked. \u201cYou\u2019re right.\u201d\n\u201cLook, Diana. That impertinent newbie didn\u2019t get picked.\u201d \nAt her friend\u2019s observation, Diana preened with satisfaction. \u201cNo surprise there. You need some manners to attend to Lady Rishe. I bet she got kicked out of the running!\u201d Her eyes sparkled with confidence.\nAt last, there was a knock at the door.\n\u201cHer Royal Highness, Princess Rishe.\u201d\nThe maids quickly fell into bows. Diana\u2019s chest ached with anticipation as heels clicked on the floor, approaching the line of girls. From the corner of their eyes, the maids saw a wide-skirted court dress. A gentle scent washed over them.\nWithout even looking at her, they could tell Crown Princess Rishe was a lovely woman. Diana and her friends swelled with pride that she was to become their mistress.\nBut then Laura whispered to Diana, \u201cHey, isn\u2019t this scent familiar?\u201d\n\u201cQuiet!\u201d Clearly it was some sort of expensive perfume. Or so Diana thought, but then she realized what it was. The words just slipped out. \u201cIt\u2019s soap.\u201d\n\u201cHuh? Did you just say something?\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s soap. The same kind we always use.\u201d Diana was sure of it.\nThe princess said, \u201cPlease rise.\u201d \nWhy did her voice sound so familiar? An incredible foreboding gripping her, Diana looked up. She gasped.\n\u201cMy name is Rishe Irmgard Weitzner.\u201d\nBefore her stood the beautiful newcomer\u2014the thorn in her side for the past few days. The smile she wore was peaceful and just the slightest bit satisfied.\n \n***\n \nI\u2019m so glad I managed to finish washing the sheets in time!\nStanding before the maids with Arnold\u2019s attendant Oliver at her side, Rishe was panicking on the inside. She\u2019d had so much to do this morning that she\u2019d put off the laundry to the last minute. She took deep, controlled breaths, praying no one would notice that she\u2019d raced here at a dead sprint.\nOliver was none the wiser as he spoke to the assembled girls. Rishe took the opportunity to look them over. She locked eyes with Elsie, who was gaping at her. It was a nice change\u2014usually her face was as blank as a rock wall.\nI\u2019m sorry for the deception. I figured blending in would give me the best picture of your working conditions.\nThe new maids wore similarly shocked expressions, while others watched her with delight. Meanwhile, the veterans, including Diana, had all gone pale. They trembled, stunned into silence. One seemed locked in a terrifying trance, while another looked on the verge of tears. All of them had spoken to Rishe with derision. As the ringleader, Diana was covering her mouth with both hands, like she was holding in a scream.\nOliver had finished his introduction. \u201cYour Highness, if you would?\u201d\nRishe stepped forward. \u201cFirst, I must apologize to you for what has transpired prior to this meeting. My deception, that is. However, it has granted me insight into how each one of you works.\u201d\nOliver\u2019s face creased in confusion. The newcomer maids began to panic, whispering among themselves.\n\u201cDoesn\u2019t this mean that she helped us out with the laundry?\u201d\n\u201cWe\u2019re going to be fired!\u201d\n\u201cIf I lose my position, my brother will have to quit school!\u201d\nNoticing the commotion, Oliver glanced at Rishe. \u201cYour Highness, two-thirds of these maids are newly recruited from the city. Since the majority of the castle maids were elderly, His Highness assumed you would prefer maids closer in age to yourself.\u201d\nRishe was startled. She had found it odd that most of her potential servants were new hires, but she hadn\u2019t expected this to be the reason.\n\u201cWhile the prince has entrusted the selection of your maids to you,\u201d Oliver went on. \u201cHiring someone with no experience will not do. Despite Prince Arnold\u2019s views, I urge you to reject the newcomers.\u201d\n\u201cOliver.\u201d\n\u201cI have a list of their names here. Elsie\u2014\u201d\n\u201cElsie, Nichole, Hilde, Marguerite, Rosa.\u201d Rishe began listing the names of the newly recruited maids. She\u2019d made a point to memorize them in the washhouse. \u201cElke, Amelia, and\u2014\u201d\nOliver looked at her wildly. \u201cYou know them all?! Even though they\u2019ve never served you in the past?\u201d\n\u201cYes, of course I do. Servants are essential to the maintenance of our lifestyle, why wouldn\u2019t I get to know them?\u201d Rishe listed the remaining names for good measure. \u201cAll twenty of you, listen to me.\u201d \nThe new maids stiffened. Diana and the other maids whose names hadn\u2019t been called were getting their wind back, wearing increasingly triumphant looks.\nRishe said, \u201cThe twenty names I just called will be my maids.\u201d\nTime seemed to stand still a moment, and then Oliver broke in with an astonished, \u201cB-but, my lady! They are all inexperienced\u2014\u201d\n\u201cYes. And my palace will be the perfect place to learn.\u201d\nThe new recruits were completely speechless, unsure of exactly what was happening. \nRishe smiled at Elsie. \u201cI hope you\u2019ll serve me well, Elsie.\u201d\nElsie was still frozen in place. \u201cHuh? Y-yes, my lady, but\u2014\u201d\nA shaking Diana cried out, \u201cBut why, my lady?! You\u2019ve seen their work! They\u2019re useless, the lot of them! The rest of us get so much more done in a shorter amount of time!\u201d\n\u201cWatch your tongue, girl,\u201d Oliver said sharply.\nDiana ignored him. \u201cWe\u2019re hard workers! Any job you assign us, we can do it! Please, I beg you, my lady!\u201d\n\u201cStep back,\u201d Oliver warned. \u201cDo not take a single step closer to Lady Rishe.\u201d\nDiana spoke in a rush, words pouring out of her. \u201cI-I freely admit that I was impolite before, but I didn\u2019t know who she was! I\u2019ll take any punishment, so please, give me the chance to show you how well I can work!\u201d\nRishe said, \u201cDiana, I have a request.\u201d\n\u201cTh-thank you, my lady!\u201d Diana heaved a sigh of relief. \u201cYou mean you\u2019ll\u2014\u201d \nRishe cut across her. \u201cAs of today, you are no longer a maid in this palace.\u201d \n\u201cWhat?\u201d Her face, usually so fixed with determination, paled. \u201cBut why? I\u2019m so much better than any of them! I\u2019ll do a perfect job no matter what task you set before me. Please don\u2019t dismiss me, my lady!\u201d \n\u201cListen to me, Diana.\u201d Rishe dropped her lofty tone, speaking as one woman would to another. \u201cYou have noticed it, haven\u2019t you? No matter what you claim, these new girls aren\u2019t worthless.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2026I don\u2019t understand.\u201d\n\u201cCan you remember your first month in service? How difficult it was?\u201d\nDiana looked completely bewildered. Her gaze darted around as if looking for help.\nPulling herself together, she forced herself to follow Rishe\u2019s directions. She thought back and finally alighted on a response. \u201cI\u2026I didn\u2019t know how to do the job. Before, when my family was still prominent, I\u2019d washed shirts and bedsheets. Never gowns or military uniforms.\u201d\n\u201cPerfectly reasonable,\u201d Rishe said. \u201cOnly natural for someone just starting out.\u201d\n\u201cThe older girls were so busy, they told me to just watch them since they didn\u2019t have time to teach me. When I had questions\u2026well, there was nobody to ask.\u201d\n\u201cI bet. And did you have any other problems?\u201d\n\u201cWell, yes. There was a lot to learn. Different kinds of soap and washboards depending on the cloth. You use different tools for different materials. I had to learn how they worked and how to put them away. I was\u2026punished if I didn\u2019t get it right the first time.\u201d\nThe newcomers were exchanging surprised looks. Rishe understood why.\nEverything Diana said was familiar to them. They spent valuable time searching for their materials and the proper ways to use them, but they shrank from asking for help. Everyone always looked so busy. This was a universal problem.\n\u201cDespite all that, I got better!\u201d Diana protested. \u201cI only needed to be taught once. Unlike them! They\u2019re useless!\u201d\n\u201cYes, well. There\u2019s a difference between you and them,\u201d Rishe told Diana. \u201cYou can read and write.\u201d\n\u201cOh!\u201d Diana started in surprise. Elsie looked at the floor.\nThe literacy rate among commoners was low no matter where you went. Very few families had the means to afford an education, especially for daughters. Diana had been born to a merchant\u2019s family\u2014she\u2019d received formal schooling. The maids she was close friends with were likely from similar backgrounds. The majority of those in service were not so fortunate.\n\u201cWhat if you only received instructions on how to do a job once and weren\u2019t able to write it down to remind yourself later?\u201d Rishe asked. \u201cWould you be so confident?\u201d\n\u201cI-I don\u2019t\u2014\u201d Diana reflexively thrust a hand into her apron pocket, where she had a list of daily tasks recorded in her neat handwriting to reference throughout the day. Hopefully now she would understand how much of an edge her privileged literacy gave her over the other maids.\n\u201cEveryone else works as hard as they can, just like you do,\u201d Rishe said. \u201cRemember how it was for you at first?",
    "query_text": " They all have to start somewhere. I hope you\u2019ll keep that in mind.\u201d\n\u201cThey\u2019re no different from me,\u201d Diana mumbled begrudgingly, glancing around the room, looking at the less experienced maids. As if coming to a decision, she said, \u201cI\u2019m sorry.\u201d\n\u201cDiana?\u201d\nLike a child enumerating her regrets, Diana went"

Is a little leisure time too much to ask? Obviously I don\u2019t want to die either! This time, I\u2019ll make as much money as I can in the first five years. Then, when I turn twenty, I\u2019ll live a life free of worldly cares. I\u2019ll do whatever\u2019s necessary to stay alive!\nHer mind made up, Rishe began her seventh life in a dead sprint through the palace. Regardless of her future plans, she was in a race against time. She needed to beat the messenger bearing news of her scandal.\nAs she ran, she yanked off her hair ornaments; she planned to sell them and didn\u2019t want to risk losing one. Her hair billowed out behind her, falling in loose waves.\nSuddenly, an idea occurred to her, one she hadn\u2019t had in any of her previous six lives.\nLeaving through the palace gardens would be faster. I can climb down a tree from the balcony.\nRishe had gone to war as a knight in the life just before this one. After the punishing battlefield training, climbing trees was nothing.\nSeamlessly, she changed direction. She raced for the balcony, where she ran into something at full speed.\n\u201cBwargh!\u201d Rishe let out a very unladylike grunt, staggering a few steps. She looked up to see what she\u2019d bounced off of. \u201cOh\u2026\u201d\nAn exceptionally handsome man stood in her path.\nHe had refined, patrician features and cruel, thin lips. He was slender yet powerful; even through his clothes, Rishe could tell his body was well conditioned. His jet-black hair covered his ears, creeping down to the nape of his neck. The tips of his locks bounced with his movements. They looked to be soft to the touch.\nFrom head to toe, he was a pleasure to look at\u2014but what held Rishe\u2019s attention were his eyes. They were long in shape and impossibly blue, but they possessed a blade-sharp intensity. His gaze was clear, beautiful, and cold as ice. His eyelashes cast shadows on his striking face. He was a work of art.\nCurrently, this work of art was staring her down with a look that could kill.\nHe laughed. \u201cYou barreled right into me. For a moment, I thought I\u2019d been attacked by a wild boar.\u201d\nIt was an exceedingly rude thing to say to a stranger, but as luck would have it, this man was not a stranger. At least not to Rishe.\n\u201cWhat are you even doing here?\u201d the man went on. \u201cThe party is in the\u2014\u201d\nRishe interrupted him with a wordless shout of dismay. The man drew back, reflexively reaching for his sword. He composed himself with visible difficulty. \u201cWho are you? You look like any noblewoman, but your manner is\u2026\u201d \n\u201cEmperor Arnold Hein!\u201d \nThe man\u2019s eyes widened. He didn\u2019t mistake her surging contempt. Rishe had crossed swords with this man. Recently. He was the one responsible for ending her sixth life. \nHe must be a guest at the banquet. It makes sense.\nArnold Hein was the scion of a military nation not far from Rishe\u2019s home country of Hermity, the one in which they now stood. Their kingdoms, so recently at war, had brokered an ostensible peace, and the two ruling families met from time to time. Crown Prince Dietrich\u2019s engagement party would be one such occasion. He\u2019d gathered elites from far and wide to introduce to his beloved Mary.\nThe man eyed Rishe with rising curiosity. \u201cYou know me? This is my first time in Hermity.\u201d\nUh-oh. Rishe pasted on a smile as her mind spun in circles. This man was dangerous. She had to avoid entanglements with him at all costs. Five years from now, Arnold Hein would invade Hermity. \nHe was an extraordinarily skilled swordsman and, with a powerful military at his back, was destined to conquer kingdom after kingdom. He had done as much in her second, third, fourth, and fifth lives. In her sixth, Rishe had faced him in battle herself and died by his hand.\nWe never had a chance. That war was lost before it began.\nArnold\u2019s brilliance lay not in his swordplay but in his skill as a tactician. He set countries up for conquest and knocked them down, swallowing them one by one.\nI know him, but he doesn\u2019t know me. We haven\u2019t met in this life. I need an excuse fast. \nRishe curtsied slowly. \u201cMy name is Rishe Irmgard Weitzner. We\u2019ve never been introduced, but I\u2019ve heard of you.\u201d\nArnold donned an amused smile. \u201cYou plant your weight like a trained swordswoman. Your center of gravity is perfect.\u201d\n\u201cYou exaggerate,\u201d Rishe demurred. \u201cThat was simply a curtsy to an esteemed guest.\u201d \n\u201cI must have misheard, but I swear you called me \u2018emperor\u2019 just now.\u201d \nRishe froze.\n\u201cMy father yet lives,\u201d Arnold said.",
    "query_text": " \u201cI am simply a crown prince. Why would you call me that?\u201d \n\u201cUh, um\u2026\u201d Rishe floundered for an answer.\nShe\u2019d made such a foolish mistake. Arnold\u2019s gaze cut right through her. It felt like he\u2019d see through any lie she told right down to her soul. She remembered this from the battlefield\u2014how his attention alone felt like a sword thrust.\nBut why even bother to lie? They\u2019d never meet again, so who cared what he thought of her? Sure, she harbored a hard feeling or two over the recent slaying, but there was no point complaining about it to this Arnold. Calling him the emperor was boorish, but Rishe was in the process of being forcibly exiled. Why play"

    "prefix_text": "\nThe two nations enjoyed peaceful relations, but Arnold remained the dreaded prince, heir to the throne of a former enemy. Current rumor wasn\u2019t as widespread as it would be in five years, but he was still regarded with distrust.\nThe onlookers stood rooted to the spot, too terrified to flee.\nWell, this has devolved into a full-fledged disaster.\nRishe heaved a frustrated sigh. \u201cPrince Arnold, to what do we owe this honor? Surely a crown prince would not draw his sword for a mere jest.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m here on business,\u201d Arnold said. \u201cBut first, I must beg forgiveness for my rudeness.\u201d\nHuh, what do you know? Once he became emperor, he\u2019d gladly behead any subject who so much as dared speak a word against him.\nI guess at nineteen he still knew how to apologize.\nIf that surprised her, Arnold\u2019s next act completely obliterated her sense of reality. \nWith a flourish, he fell to his knees. \n\u201cHuh?\u201d Is this actually happening? \nHe was a man destined for an imperial crown. A man who would stand at the head of a military powerhouse and spread his rule across continents.\nArnold, known for his frigid pride, knelt to the disgraced daughter of a duke.\nAnd not only that\u2014his head was bowed, looking nothing so much as a knight swearing allegiance to his lady. If it were anyone else, it would be a delightful, pious image. Instead, the assembled looked on in terrified awe.\nNot Rishe, though.\n\u201cWhat are you doing?\u201d she hissed. \u201cGet up!\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m apologizing for my baseless impertinence. Also, I\u2019m asking you\u2026\u201d He trailed off to take Rishe\u2019s hand, tugging her forward so forcefully she staggered. He gazed up at her.\nUgh. He\u2019s so beautiful. No matter how many times she looked at him, it didn\u2019t become any less disarming. Long eyelashes, arched brows, a noble nose. His bright blue eyes reminded her of the drift ice she\u2019d seen in a northern kingdom, gazing out from a ship in one of her past lives. She knew she was dwelling on this to buy time, even as the reality before her sank in.\n\u201c\u2026to become my wife.\u201d\nShe froze, unable to process the words. \u201cWhat?\u201d Rishe glanced around, desperately searching the faces of the crowd. They all seemed as stunned as she felt. She looked down at Arnold again. \u201cYour wife?\u201d \n\u201cYes, that\u2019s right.\u201d\n\u201cYou want me to become your wife?\u201d\n\u201cYes.\u201d\nRishe couldn\u2019t speak. This was truly happening. It was real. It clicked into place in her head, and she let out a strangled grunt.\nWhat is going on? Why is this happening?\nShock lapped at her, fuzzing at the corners of her vision. He wanted to marry her. Arnold wanted to marry Rishe. Her murderer wanted to marry her.\nWhy is he doing this? He must have some ulterior motive, a broader goal. But I have to give him an answer.\nThe onlookers were holding their breath as Rishe said flatly, \u201cI reject your proposal.\u201d\nArnold said nothing.\nShe had to reject him. She was going to live a long, peaceful, carefree life, damn it, and no one would stop her. And yet\u2026\nArnold began to laugh, and the deep, creeping sense of dread inside Rishe only grew. Why does he seem so amused by this?!\n \n***\n \nHer previous life was her sixth. Disguised as a man, Rishe rose as a warrior of an island country she came upon in her travels. It was a conventional yet charming kingdom formed of red brick. After striking up a friendship with a group of knights who didn\u2019t realize she was a woman, Rishe followed their advice and joined them.\nThe training was grueling enough to make her wish she were dead. Back when she had lived as a noble, she\u2019d learned how to wield a sword for basic self-defense, but training as a noble lady had in no way prepared her for this. She drilled relentlessly, barely taking the time to sleep. Just as she became a full-fledged knight, Emperor Arnold\u2019s forces lay siege to the castle.\n \n***\n \nHow could this happen? \nIn her seventh life, Rishe wearily sank into her chair. Across from her sat Arnold, his legs crossed and chin propped up on his hand, watching her lazily.\n\u201cWhat\u2019s the matter?\u201d he asked. \u201cYou seem unhappy.\u201d\n\u201cYou could say that.\u201d Even her voice was grumpy. Still, she couldn\u2019t very well tell him it was because she bore a grudge from a previous life. After the first time her life rewound to that pivotal moment, she\u2019d resolved to keep her loops a secret. \u201cI had plans for my exile. A brand-new life. And now because of you, my parents are involved. Even the king has heard about it!\u201d\nAfter Rishe rejected Arnold, Dietrich had immediately cried out, \u201cTh-the crown prince of Galkhein proposed to Rishe?!\u201d\nHis shrieks were loud enough to attract the attention of the master and mistress of the manor.\nWhen her parents came out, Rishe had protested, \u201cI\u2019m not going to marry him! I\u2019m leaving the country just as Dietrich commanded.\u201d\nNo one listened. Their faces just paled with nervous confusion.\nJust then, a glittering coach arrived. Half-stuck in the mud, the man inside it was forced to trudge over the swampy ground, and so the king of Hermity himself arrived, staggering and dirt-stained. \nHe grabbed hold of his son\u2019s collar, pushing him into a low bow. He then turned to Prince Arnold and said, rather loudly, \u201cYour Highness! Allow me to apologize for my son\u2019s foolishness! You are an esteemed guest all the way from Galkhein! It is unthinkable he would not offer you the courtesy you are due!\u201d\n\u201cYou\u2019re hurting me, Father! My back!\u201d\nThe king then turned to Rishe. \u201cMy lady, allow me to sincerely apologize as both a king and a father. My son\u2019s behavior toward you has been utterly disgraceful. I beg you to please give Prince Arnold\u2019s proposal due consideration. Not only for your own sake but for the sake of your country.\u201d\nThe king bowed to her as deeply as his son had to Arnold, and her parents joined him. Rishe felt dizzy at the sight of this abject debasement in the presence of citizens.\nArnold, who had been watching the proceedings with a detached amusement, sobered and stepped toward the king. \u201cYour Majesty, please rise.\u201d\nWithout the smirk, Arnold\u2019s face immediately reverted to its cold mask. The king didn\u2019t move. Maybe something in Arnold\u2019s voice kept him frozen.\n\u201cSuch a trifle won\u2019t cause discord between our kingdoms,\u201d he went on. \u201cHowever, I would beg a little time to speak with Lady Rishe.\u201d\nLater, Rishe would learn that Arnold\u2019s attendant had spoken to the king\u2019s own gentleman, certain that his words would reach their target. \u201cMy master took such trouble to attend these festivities, and this is the welcome he is offered? I wonder, what will the emperor think when he learns of his son\u2019s slighting at your nation\u2019s hands?\u201d\n\u201cIf you would, Lady Rishe?\u201d The plump king looked to be on the verge of tears.\nRishe had no obligation to accept and no desire to spend a moment longer in this country than was absolutely necessary. But acquiescence seemed the fastest way to move things along.\nAs her mind whirled, Arnold leaned in to whisper, \u201cIf you refuse to hear my suit, you won\u2019t deter me. I\u2019ll simply move on to Plan B.\u201d\nAnd that was how she found herself in one of the palace\u2019s parlors, here to \u201cjust talk\u201d to Prince Arnold. The ball guests were all gone. It was just the two of them.\n\u201cI want to know what you\u2019re planning,\u201d Rishe said flatly.\n\u201cPlanning? Me?\u201d\n\u201cBy asking me to marry you. You don\u2019t know me. A proposal like this wouldn\u2019t come out of the blue.\u201d\nThis man was destined to become an aggressive warmonger over the next few years. He wouldn\u2019t do anything without a dozen motives.\nPrince Arnold just smiled. \u201cI have no plans. I\u2019m simply enamored with you.\u201d\n\u201cEnamored\u2026?\u201d\nThat was the last thing she\u2019d expected him to say. Asking him to elaborate didn\u2019t seem worth the breath\u2014he was obviously lying. As if this ruthless, inhuman creature with ice in his veins could feel even a flicker of affection.\n\u201cWhy refuse me?\u201d Arnold asked. \u201cYour engagement is broken, you\u2019re on the verge of exile, and you have no faction or supporters. At this rate, you\u2019ll be dead within a fortnight. I\u2019d call my offer a stroke of unbelievable fortune.\u201d\n\u201cYou\u2019re not wrong,\u201d Rishe admitted. \u201cOnce upon a time, I would have jumped at your offer.\u201d\nIf it had been made in her first life, for instance. But now Rishe knew better. Her life was only just getting started, and the future held endless possibilities. After the horror of her sixth loop, she yearned for freedom.\nI don\u2019t want to marry him. I won\u2019t be anyone\u2019s captive. Still\u2026\nRishe, more than anyone, knew that the slightest adjustment could enact profound changes on the trajectory of a life. No doubt she\u2019d have many more lives, but this could be the only one where marriage to Arnold would be an option.\nThe dread emperor. The tyrant. The man who will stoke the fires of war. \nRishe knew the gossip, the endless conjecture behind Arnold Hein\u2019s bloody reign, but she didn\u2019t know the truth.\nWhy? The question had haunted her since her first life. She\u2019d never before had the chance to even speak to him.\nShe had wondered it as a merchant, hearing of the distant outbreak of war. She\u2019d wondered when the news of the dead and dying reached her apothecary. When she had comforted her terrified mistress in her life as a maid, assuring her everything would be all right. When she squared off against him in battle, as he plunged a sword through her heart\u2014even then she wondered. \nIf I stick around, maybe I\u2019ll finally have my answer. Half of her was dying to know. The other half didn\u2019t give a damn. And yet\u2026\nShe recalled a childhood dream. Rather, a longing.\nRishe let out a breath. \u201cYou claim you are enamored with me.\u201d\n\u201cYes. I am completely under your spell.\u201d\nTo think he could spout such nonsense with a straight face!\n\u201cThen will you grant me anything I desire?\u201d\n\u201cSo long as it is within my power,\u201d Arnold said. \u201cAnything you want will be yours.\u201d\nRishe hesitated, gathering her thoughts. \u201cI have some conditions.\u201d Arnold silently motioned for her to go on. \u201cI want full control over the wedding festivities. Everything must be procured through merchants of my choosing.\u201d\n\u201cFine.\u201d Arnold nodded. \u201cYou\u2019re free to do business with whomever you wish.\u201d\n\u201cAfter we are married, I must be in a position to mingle with guests from abroad.\u201d\n\u201cThat sounds within the purview of the crown princess. Anything else?\u201d\n\u201cI will be allowed to live in a separate residence from your mother and father.\u201d\nShe meant this seriously, but it made Arnold laugh. \u201cYou don\u2019t seem the type to worry about an overbearing mother-in-law.\u201d\n\u201cYou would be surprised. Combative relationships with one\u2019s new family are the most difficult part of marriage, or so they say. It could be a ramshackle cottage for all I care\u2014I just require a secondary residence.\u201d\nActually, Rishe didn\u2019t care at all about in-laws. When Arnold set his war into motion, his first move would be the assassination of his father. A genuine coup by patricide, not at all like Dietrich\u2019s clumsy attempt. Next, he would name himself emperor, take control of the country, and mobilize the military.\nSeparating him from his parents will make the first step more difficult\u2014although not impossible, unfortunately.\n\u201cAnything else?\u201d Arnold asked. \u201cI\u2019ll do whatever it takes to marry you.\u201d\n\u201cIdeally, I\u2019d like to know your endgame,\u201d Rishe said with dignity. \u201cBut as I doubt there\u2019s any chance of that, I have one final request.\u201d She jabbed a finger into his face, regardless of how rude it was. \u201cI will spend my time idling around the castle. No work, no study. I shall be utterly useless.\u201d\nLet\u2019s see just how much you want me as your princess.\nAfter a long moment of silence, Arnold cracked a merry laugh. The proposal remained; all her conditions were met.\n\n(2) chapter number given is likely out of range: 0\nChapter: 7\n\nChapter 2\nChapter 2\n \n\u201cYOU KNOW, it was only after I went into commerce that I truly had a dream for the future,\u201d Rishe had once confided in a friend. \u201cUp until then, I existed only as the crown prince\u2019s fianc\u00e9e or my father\u2019s daughter. My every act was to become more worthy of that status. But now, for the first time, I actually have a goal of my own.\u201d\n\u201cOh, yeah?\u201d her friend said. He was the ruler of the desert kingdom, and his smile was awfully charming. \u201cWhat\u2019s that?\u201d\nRishe smiled back. \u201cI want to travel to every single country in the world. I want to see everything in every town, peruse their markets, and meet the eyes of every person who lives there!\u201d\nBy now, that felt like such a distant dream.\n \n***\n \nRishe awoke with a start, eyes snapping open as she sensed a disturbance in the air.\nShe unsheathed her sword halfway, primed for danger. \nInside the coach, her old enemy sat across from her, one hand outstretched. \u201cWhat do you think you\u2019re doing?\u201d she demanded.\nWhen they\u2019d boarded the coach, Rishe had warned him not to lay a single finger on her throughout the trip to his kingdom. Ordering the prince not to touch his consort was absurd, but Arnold readily agreed. He had, after all, promised to follow her every direction.\nAnd yet, here he was, already breaking his promise.\nArnold appeared unperturbed by her glare. \u201cDon\u2019t look at me like that. I was merely trying to recover what you took from me.\u201d\nConfused, Rishe looked at the sword in her hand. It had a black lacquered scabbard with a simple golden decoration. Engraved on the hilt was the Galkhein crest.\n\u201cOh!\u201d Rishe thrust the sword back at Arnold. \u201cMy apologies.\u201d\nArnold chuckled. \u201cYou caught me off guard. You were nodding off, and then you suddenly snatched up my sword. You looked quite content snuggling up with it.\u201d\nArnold propped the sword beside him. Rishe pressed a hand to her chest to quell her racing heart. The sword that gutted me in my previous life is now my bedmate. What a world. Her recent stint as a knight had left her ill at ease without a blade at hand. She just couldn\u2019t believe it was Arnold\u2019s she\u2019d reached for.\n\u201cI didn\u2019t mean to disturb you, but I doubted sleeping with a weapon would be comfortable. I\u2019m impressed you sensed my intent before I even touched you.\u201d Arnold rested one elbow against the window frame, watching her with shameless fascination. \u201cOne only develops instincts like that from combat training. And you were also a member of the court? How in the world did you find the time?\u201d\nRishe shrugged. She couldn\u2019t just say, I pretended to be a man in a previous life, that\u2019s how.\n\u201cI assume there\u2019s more to you than your devotion to the sword. You seem to like flowers.\u201d\nShe followed Arnold\u2019s gaze to where she\u2019d bundled a small bouquet in a handkerchief. This was their fifth day on the road to Galkhein. Every day, without fail, she\u2019d picked flowers whenever they stopped to water the horses. The ones from today were still fresh, but the ones she\u2019d begun drying five days ago were just about ready.\n\u201cI didn\u2019t pick these because they\u2019re pretty.\u201d Rishe brought the blooms to her face, spirits rising at their sweet scent. Spring wildflowers had a soft and gentle smell. Rishe looked out the window at the forest spreading toward Galkhein, thinking of the rare native flowers going into bloom. She wished she could pick those as well, but that would cause too much delay. She gazed on wistfully.\nAfter watching her in silence for some time, Arnold said, \u201cBy the way, I sent one of my men ahead on a fast horse to deliver your order to the company you requested. They\u2019ll be invited to Galkhein to discuss the wedding ceremony.\u201d\n\u201cThank you,\u201d Rishe said. \u201cI\u2019m glad you kept your word.\u201d\n\u201cThe Aria Trading Company,\u201d Arnold mused. \u201cI\u2019ve heard of them. They\u2019re up-and-comers, aren\u2019t they? Have you done business with them before?\u201d\n\u201cNo, but I heard from a friend that they hold a very high standard of quality.\u201d\nRishe was pleasantly surprised at how easily Arnold had acc",

Getting them to do business with someone else could be difficult.\nI want to establish a connection with Aria as soon as possible, Rishe thought. It was, of course, the company that had taken her in during her first life.\nThe company had been established just two years prior to picking her up by its owner, a man named Tully. They were still in their growth stage, but in just a few years, they would be the grandest trading company in all the world. They\u2019d"

They didn\u2019t appear badly injured, yet they all seemed exhausted.\n\u201cExcuse me, can I take a look?\u201d Rishe approached the knight acting as a medic. He looked round, startled by her presence.\n\u201cNonsense, my lady. Don\u2019t trouble yourself, you must have had quite a scare.\u201d\nThis was not unreasonable, but the wariness in his eyes made it clear he wanted her nowhere near his comrade. He isn\u2019t just being polite. He truly is on guard. \nBeside them, an injured knight groaned as another helped him up. \u201cWhat\u2019s wrong with you?\u201d the second knight asked the first. \n\u201cI-I feel\u2026numb.\u201d\n\u201cWhat? Damn.\u201d The knight grabbed up one of the fallen bandit\u2019s swords, going pale as he inspected the blade. \u201cYour Highness, look at this. Poison.\u201d\nArnold clicked his tongue. \u201cLocate every laceration and bind them close to the heart. Suck the poison from the wounds.\u201d\nHe mostly got that right, at least. In the meantime, Rishe located the nearest bound bandit and pulled his dagger out of its sheath. Its wet coating gleamed in the sunlight, just as the knight had said.\nThey applied the poison liberally\u2014whatever it is must be cheap and easily bought in bulk.\nShe wafted the smell toward her, bracing for something rancid, but detected nothing. Then she brought it closer to her nose.\nIt smells sweet, like an overripe apple. Shea grass and\u2026bluecap mushrooms. All the knights appear to have the same symptoms, so I won\u2019t have to check every blade.\nRishe stood back up and headed for the coach.\nOliver took a step after her. \u201cYour Highness, Lady Rishe is\u2014\u201d\n\u201cLeave her. She may do as she pleases.\u201d\n\u201cShe\u2019s well trained,\u201d Oliver mused. \u201cBut a battlefield is no place for a young lady. She probably wasn\u2019t prepared for such a dreadful spectacle.\u201d\nRishe ignored the murmurs and focused on her work. There they are. I\u2019ll take these, these, and\u2026\n\u201cThe poison must be a sleeping drug,\u201d she overheard Arnold saying. \u201cHunters use such drugs to weaken larger prey. I doubt this dose is lethal.\u201d\n\u201cBut it certainly is annoying,\u201d replied Oliver. \u201cWe\u2019re still two days out from Galkhein. Lugging a company of sleeping men in armor won\u2019t be pleasant.\u201d\n\u201cWe\u2019ll have to stop somewhere nearby. A hunter\u2019s settlement. Perhaps they will have an antidote\u2014\u201d\n\u201cExcuse me.\u201d Rishe, who\u2019d returned from the carriage, raised a hand. \u201cI have an antidote.\u201d\n\u201cWhat?\u201d\nThe entire company stared at her in awe.\n \n***\n \nAs it turned out, Arnold\u2019s guess was right. \nThis sweet-smelling substance was a hunter\u2019s drug, made from ingredients that were only toxic in their raw form. Heat rendered them harmless. Rishe had encountered this poison several times before, curing a customer afflicted with it during her life as an apothecary.\n\u201cA lethal dose for a grown man would fill a wine glass. They likely got less than a hundredth of that,\u201d Rishe explained to Arnold, not looking up from her work. \u201cStill, the numbness can block their airways with the roots of their tongues. It\u2019s best to lay them on their sides.\u201d\n\u201cYes, I understand the theory and the solution.\u201d Arnold gazed down at Rishe\u2019s hands. \u201cThe part I\u2019m struggling with is why you\u2019re the one telling me this.\u201d\n\u201cWell, I know how to make the antidote,\u201d Rishe said patiently as she muddled the herbs together in the white soup bowl she\u2019d borrowed for her flowers. She crushed them with the back of a spoon before adding another dried flower, crushing that as well, and combining them to form a paste. This process would be easier with a pestle, but she wasn\u2019t about to complain. \u201cThis poison is common\u2014it\u2019s cheap and easy to make, which often means the antidote is simple as well.\u201d\nThe antidote was synthesized, in fact, when hunters witnessed a deer showing no symptoms after eating a certain mushroom. They tested those along with other common herbs the deer ate. Rishe mentally thanked them for their scientific rigor as she added a bit of water, straining it all through a cloth.\nRishe stood up, brandishing the bowl of bright green medicine. \u201cBoiling would make the antidote more potent, but this works in a pinch.\u201d\nThat was when she noticed the astonished stares. Unsure of what social faux paus she\u2019d perpetrated, she looked away. Oliver was completely stunned. Arnold looked thoughtful. It was imperative the knights were treated as soon as possible, but to Rishe\u2019s dismay, no one was moving. \nDo they not trust me? That makes sense. Anyone would be reluctant to use medicine concocted by a complete stranger. But the longer we wait, the harder the poison will become to cure. \nShe needed to dispel their doubts. Rolling up her sleeve, Rishe approached Arnold and drew his sword from its scabbard. \u201cI need to borrow this for a moment, Your Highness.\u201d\n\u201cWhat are you\u2014\u201d\nShe pushed the blade against the soft skin of her inner arm. Blood welled up, along with the sharp sting of pain. Nothing compared to her injuries sustained during her life as a knight, though.\nArnold did not share her nonchalance. \u201cWhat do you think you\u2019re doing?!\u201d\nHe grabbed for her arm. She stepped out of his grasp. Was blood truly so shocking? She didn\u2019t have the time to worry about it. Clutching the overfull bowl, Rishe hurried back to the knights.\n\u201cDon\u2019t worry. This isn\u2019t poison,\u201d Rishe said. She demonstrated as much by drizzling it with a spoon over her own fresh wound. It stung. That meant the ingredients were working.\n\u201cThis is crushed liquori grass, luqua flowers, and carilya nuts. I\u2019ll swallow some if that\u2019s what it takes to prove it\u2019s safe.\u201d It was horribly bitter; she hoped it wouldn\u2019t come to that. \u201cThe paralysis will last for days. Please make up your mind quickly.\u201d\n\u201cMake up our mind?\u201d\n\u201cWill you allow me to cure the poison? Or would you rather drag paralyzed soldiers all the way to Galkhein? I suppose you could waste His Highness\u2019s time searching for a hunter\u2019s settlement to use their antidote.\u201d She smiled serenely. \u201cIt makes no difference to us. Right, Your Highness?\u201d\nIn the end, Rishe applied the antidote.\nThe recovery took a few hours. While they waited, Rishe picked herbs in the same meadow she\u2019d been gazing at with yearning from the carriage. A fortuitous turn of events. She found anti-inflammatory herbs and flowers to ease sour bellies, ingredients for curing headaches, and mushrooms for inducing slumber. She wrapped them all up in a handkerchief.\nIn the meantime, Arnold dispatched a messenger to this region\u2019s lord, making arrangements to deliver the apprehended bandits. After coordinating with Oliver, he drifted over to Rishe.\n\u201cI see your interest in flowers is mercenary, rather than ornamental,\u201d he said, surveying the heaps of herbs gathered on the bank of the pond. He sat down beside her.\nWhen he didn\u2019t say anything more, Rishe went back to work plucking leaves from plants with valuable stems. The leaves had no medicinal effects, but they did make a decent broth. Slumber mushroom spores were a nuisance unless dried; they were spread out beside her in the sun.\nI wonder, would he be annoyed if I attached herbs to the roof of the coach? That would be unusual adornment for a crown prince\u2019s retinue, but it wouldn\u2019t hurt to ask.\nShe realized, quite suddenly, that Arnold was looking at her. At her hands, specifically. He sat cross-legged with his chin propped on his fist, staring absently, like a kid watching a column of ants march by.\nWhat is so fascinating about herbs?\nTheir eyes met. \u201cAm I bothering you?\u201d he asked.\nR",

She had to operate under the possibility that this life could be her last. This required some thought, but standing around seething with anxiety wouldn\u2019t help.\nRight now I\u2019ll focus on cleaning. Once the bath is here, I\u2019ll scrub off all the dust and travel exhaustion. And then I can finally relax! \nBrimming with new determination, she stood up and headed for the well. She was forestalled by the sound of jeering giggles. \n\u201cAww, look at the new girl, trying so hard,\u201d said one voice.\n\u201cAll the enthusiasm in the world won\u2019t make a difference,\u201d said another. \u201cWe\u2019re going to be the crown princess\u2019s maids, not you.\u201d\nThe first added, \u201cHey, are you even listening? Stop wasting your time!\u201d\nRishe heard a weak scream, followed by a thump, like a body hitting the ground. She broke into a run, finding a blonde girl sprawled in the dirt, surrounded by four other women.\n\u201cAre you all right?\u201d Rishe hurried over to help the girl up. Her maid\u2019s uniform\u2014a loose navy-blue dress with a white apron\u2014was smeared with mud. The others were dressed identically.\n\u201cWho are you?\u201d one of the girls snapped at Rishe. She had a mop of blazing-red hair. \u201cAnother newbie?\u201d\nAn understandable mistake. Rishe\u2019s dress was simple, free of ornamentation, and her hair was bound back in a ponytail to keep it out of the way. She was dust-streaked, sweaty, and carrying a bucket in her arms.\nTelling them who I am will be more trouble than it\u2019s worth.

Those pretty hands of yours don\u2019t look like they\u2019ve ever held a broom,\u201d said one of them.\n\u201cUnfortunately for you, we\u2019ve been working here three years, and we\u2019ll be the ones to serve Prince Arnold as the maids of his palace.\u201d\n\u201cCan you stand? Oh, good, it looks like you\u2019re not injured.\u201d Rishe helped the girl up out of the dirt. \n\u201cHey, don\u2019t ignore us!\u201d the redheaded maid shouted. \u201cYou\u2019ve got some nerve. If you want to make it here, you\u2019ll know your place! I doubt the two of you will last a week!\u201d\nRishe didn\u2019t respond, her attention snagging on something else. The redhead was carrying curtains, probably to bring them to the wash. Rishe stared at them so hard the maid began to shift uncomfortably. \u201cWhat\u2019s your problem?\u201d\n\u201cYou should wait to wash those,\u201d Rishe said.\nThe girl glared daggers at her. \u201cExcuse me? Are you telling me it\u2019s too late in the day? You really are an amateur! The light lasts longer in the spring, you know. And it\u2019s hot today. There\u2019ll be plenty of\u2014\u201d \n\u201cIt\u2019s going to rain, is all.\u201d\nThe maids exchanged glances. \u201cHow can you be so sure?\u201d\n\u201cLook at the clouds amassing. The butterflies and the bees are flying low. The moisture in the air will make the drying take longer.\u201d\n\u201cWhat?\u201d\nAnother maid spoke up in a soft voice. \u201cDiana, you were the one who said we should take the initiative to wash the bigger pieces. You said the crown prince would choose us for his household!\u201d\n\u201cStop putting the blame on me! This isn\u2019t my fault.\u201d An indignant flush crept over the redhead\u2019s face. \u201cThere\u2019s no way some upstart can tell what time it\u2019s going to rain! The weather is going to be fantastic all day. Come on, we\u2019re hauling these over to the wash!\u201d\nThe three girls meekly followed Diana.\nRishe sighed, turning to the blonde girl. \u201cAre you hurt?\u201d\n\u201cNo, I\u2019m fine.\u201d The girl\u2019s gaze darted around nervously. \u201cI\u2019m Elsie. Thank you for helping me.\u201d Her face was studiously blank, but from the way she struggled with her words, Rishe could tell she was being genuine.\n\u201cDon\u2019t worry about it,\u201d Rishe said. \u201cYour uniform seems to have fared less well.\u201d\n\u201cOh no.\u201d Elsie looked down at herself. Her face remained vacant, but she seemed sad. \u201cAnd I just got it.\u201d \n\u201cYou can get the dirt out if you wash it straight away. It\u2019s going to rain, but this dress should dry quickly. Use lots of soap, but don\u2019t scrub it by hand\u2014scrape the mud off with a brush.\u201d\n\u201cWhy a brush?\u201d\n\u201cBecause your fingers will just grind dirt into the threads. A brush is more porous.\u201d\nThe young sons of the family Rishe served spent their time tumbling in the dirt, and she had plenty of experience scraping mud out of clothes. She could even salvage dirty socks that had spent days crumpled in the corner.\n\u201cDo you\u2026 Are you\u2026\u201d Elsie trailed off, blinking rapidly a couple of times before finally looking Rishe in the eyes. \u201cAre you the crown princess\u2019s maid?\u201d\nUnsure how to answer, Rishe couldn\u2019t meet her eyes.\n \n***\n \nAfter parting ways with Elsie, Rishe returned to the detached wing with her fresh water. She put clean sheets on the bed the knights had installed, satisfied that she had a comfortable place to sleep. This room also had the highest-up balcony in the whole detached palace.\nTaking a break, she wandered out onto the balcony and looked off over the capital, the golden afternoon tinged with the onset of twilight. The day was fresh with a recent rain, the air clear enough to see for miles. The spring breeze felt good against her skin, sweaty from cleaning. Rishe leaned against the railing, leaning her head back and closing her eyes.\nShe felt like collapsing into bed immediately, but she desperately needed a wash. Still, she didn\u2019t want to pull herself away from the view and the breeze just yet. When she resumed gazing out absentmindedly, something her mother once said drifted back to her. \n\u201cRishe, there is no need for you to think for yourself.\u201d\nShe frowned, the memories coming thick and fast now.\n\u201cYou mustn\u2019t forget that the duty of our family is to live our lives fully devoted to the kings of the land. You\u2019re smart, but all the thinking in the world won\u2019t do a woman any good. You need only concern yourself with how best to serve the crown prince.\u201d\n\u201cStudies? Focus on social etiquette\u2014that\u2019s what you need for navigating high society. The crown prince\u2019s bride must be flawless. Your smile is lacking. You must always strive to appear amiable.\u201d\nRishe breathed out a long sigh. When I was fifteen, their lectures were the only thing I thought about.\nHer parents preached constantly. \u201cA woman\u2019s true happiness is to marry a suitable man and give birth to his heirs.\u201d\n\u201cBut, Mother\u2026\u201d\nObjection was not permitted. Any argument was immediately dispensed with. As a woman, Rishe could not inherit her father\u2019s title. Her only value was in her marriage. \nDespite knowing now that the opinions of others were as worthless as empty titles, the words still echoed in her memories.\nRishe\u2019s fingertips twitched, and she opened her eyes. Unmoving, she said, \u201cShouldn\u2019t you be seeing to your duties?\u201d\n\u201cMore hidden depths, I see,\u201d came a voice tinged with pleasure. Rishe straightened and turned. There was Arnold, leaning against the door to the balcony. \u201cYou seem able to sense my approach no matter how far or how hard I try.\u201d\n\u201cYou\u2019re quite naughty, aren\u2019t you? You\u2019ve been making your presence known little by little, emanating threat, to see how quickly I catch on.\u201d\n\u201cSo you noticed that as well.\u201d Arnold joined Rishe on the balcony. She tensed, but all he did was cast a curious glance at the view. \u201cWhat were you looking at?\u201d\n\u201cThe city.\u201d Rishe was hardly going to tell him she\u2019d been looking at nothing, merely ruminating on her mother\u2019s overbearing advice. The view from the balcony was spectacular, though. \u201cWhat\u2019s that over there?\u201d\n\u201cYou mean the library? The state invested funds to expand it. We have books from all over the world.\u201d\n\u201cReally? You have a library that big?\u201d Rishe\u2019s eyes sparkled with delight. She pointed out another building. \u201cWhat about that spire? It\u2019s beautiful.\u201d\n\u201cThe church and clock tower. The bells ring out the hour.\u201d\n\u201cOoh, how wonderful! And it looks like there\u2019s a rather big market there too?\u201d\n\u201cYes, the largest market in the city. Carts line up in the early morning. Most of the offerings are made fresh every day.\u201d\n\u201cAmazing! And what about that pretty mountain over there?\u201d\nRishe tried and failed to contain her excitement. She couldn\u2019t help but imagine what seeing all these places up close would be like. The grand library, the beautiful church that told the time, and the morning market with fresh, delicious food\u2014she wanted to experience it all.\nSeeing Arnold\u2019s bemused face, she said, \u201cWhat?\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m just wondering where all this interest is coming from,\u201d he said. \u201cYou were so reluctant to come, yet here you are, brimming with curiosity for my city.\u201d\n\u201cWell\u2026\u201d she trailed off, unsure of how to respond.\nWhat should I say? Should I just tell him the truth?\nThis wasn\u2019t a secret, but talking about her hopes and dreams to the man who had killed her was a little awkward. A strange self-consciousness settled on her, her cheeks heating as she mumbled, \u201cBecause I\u2019ve always wanted to.\u201d\nArnold looked at her keenly. \u201cWanted to what?\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019ve always wanted to come here.\u201d\nDuring her life as a merchant, Rishe developed her single dream to visit everywhere in the world. That dream was cut tragically short when only one country remained: Galkhein.\nIn each of her consecutive lives, Rishe\u2019s priority became staying alive. Every time, without fail, just as she found her footing, the world was plunged into chaos. She never had the chance to see Galkhein. This betrothal was her chance. \u201cIt\u2019s probably why I agreed to marry you,\u201d she added after a moment\u2019s hesitation.\nArnold swept a tepid glance over the city. \u201cThere\u2019s nothing here worth seeing.\u201d\n\u201cThat\u2019s not true! The places you just told me about sound amazing! Your citizens are clean and happy, your knights are proper and kind. Oh, and another\u2014\u201d \nRishe broke off enumerating Galkhein\u2019s charms as Arnold turned to look at her. His face was impassively calm, but something seemed to pass by underneath, like a shadow in deep water.\n\u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d Rishe said. \u201cDid I say something odd?\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m just amazed you could be so unaware of yourself.\u201d \nWh-what a rude thing to\u2014\n\u201cI\u2019ve never met anyone like you. No one has ever spoken to me the way you do. I don\u2019t know any girls of your class with the knowledge or the physical abilities you possess. Noblewomen don\u2019t concern themselves with such things.\u201d\nRishe, there is no need for you to think for yourself.\nShe frowned. \u201cPerhaps you\u2019re right, but everything I\u2019ve learned is precious to me. No one can take my skills away\u2014I value them with my life. Some may say that my knowledge is worthless, but it makes no difference to me.\u201d She turned from the balcony, fixing him with a piercing gaze. \u201cI\u2019m the one who decides what I value.\u201d\nRishe had clawed free of her mother and father\u2019s indoctrination a long time ago. Man, woman\u2014it didn\u2019t matter. She could do anything. Being queen was not the culmination of her life; she wouldn\u2019t trade her freedom for anything.\nArnold matched her intensity. \u201cYou\u2019re right.\u201d He gently cupped her cheek in a one hand, swiping his thumb along the line of her jaw, smearing dust. \u201cLive your life here however you wish. I vow to do my utmost to protect you.\u201d\n\u201cHuh?\u201d\nHis vehemence took her by surprise. Arnold had every right to demand she act the part of a proper consort. This was a political marriage; Rishe was essentially a hostage, after all. Yet here he was, cosigning her misbehavior. Moreover, he was all but swearing to defend her from the consequences.\n\u201cWhy?\u201d\n\u201cYou know why. I\u2019m enamored with you.\u201d Arnold fed her the same line. \u201cI know you said you don\u2019t care about other people\u2019s approval, but I like your asymmetrical talents. I don\u2019t find them useless at all.\u201d \nRishe didn\u2019t know how to respond.\n\u201cI thought I\u2019d already made that clear.\u201d He took his hand back, drawing away, stopping just on the threshold. He turned back to a stunned Rishe and said, \u201cLet me know if there\u2019s anything you desire. I realize I just broke our agreement\u2014the one about not touching you",
    "query_text": ".\u201d\nAnd with that, he was gone.\nShaken, Rishe sank to the floor of the balcony. I can\u2019t predict him at all! Just what is Arnold Hein planning?\nThe quiet of evening fell over the imperial capital of Galkhein.\n \n***\n \n\u201cMmm.\u201d\nSunshine streamed through the window as Rishe roused from sleep. She rolled over, basking in the morning light. The wall she expected wasn\u2019t there, and the bed seemed larger than usual. Taking advantage of it, she stretched out as far as she could.\nWas this her chamber at home? Or maybe she was a merchant again"

There\u2019s no reason for you to attend.\u201d\nIt made sense. The crown prince\u2014the greatest catch in the kingdom\u2014marrying a foreigner without even the slightest nod to propriety would invite unwanted discontent from the nobility.\n\u201cHowever, we\u2019re betrothed,\u201d Arnold said. \u201cThis whole evening is merely a formality. And with news that you\u2019re my \u2018hostage\u2019 going around, you\u2019ll be an object of curiosity. I don\u2019t want to put you through that.\u201d\n\u201cWell, I already went to the trouble of getting ready.\u201d Rishe plucked at her soft blue dress, draped in fluttering layers around her like a flower bud. She\u2019d braided her hair, decorating it with accessories. Her makeup was light, her shoes polished to a mirror shine. Her only jewelry was a pair of pearl earrings.\n\u201cRishe\u2026\u201d\n\u201cYour Highness, the court may consider my status as a captive princess shameful in the extreme, but I don\u2019t.\u201d She\u2019d chosen this course, after all.\nArnold was again watching her with a mixture of wonder and confusion.\n\u201cSo don\u2019t worry,\u201d she said, extending her hand. \u201cFeel free to show off your fianc\u00e9e.\u201d\nArnold relented, his dashing smile creeping out once again. \u201cVery well. I should take advantage of this opportunity to touch my betrothed.\u201d\n\u201cWe\u2019re wearing gloves.\u201d\nArnold took Rishe\u2019s hand.\nA throng of guests was gathered in the ballroom as a group of musicians performed on a platform. Women in gowns stood clustered, while gentlemen in military attire grouped together. A mere glance was enough to tell their clothes were of the highest quality. They mingled happily, making small talk with glasses in hand.\nRishe let her hand rest on Arnold\u2019s arm as she paused at the threshold to take it all in. \u201cThis is a bigger event than I was expecting.\u201d\n\u201cIs it? I\u2019d say it\u2019s a rather small gathering, actually.\u201d\n\u201cMaybe for a military powerhouse,\u201d Rishe muttered. \nYet another reminder of Galkhein\u2019s wealth took her off guard. Arnold just looked bored.\n\u201cThe size doesn\u2019t matter,\u201d he said. \u201cIn the end, they\u2019re only here for gossip. Look, here they come.\u201d\nIn the blink of an eye, they were surrounded by guests.\n\u201cPrince Arnold, thank you for gracing us with an invitation,\u201d said one man. \u201cSuch a pleasure.\u201d \n\u201cThe pleasure is mine, Lord Abel,\u201d Arnold drawled.\n\u201cYour Highness! We were so glad to hear of your safe return,\u201d another guest chirped. \u201cPlease, our daughter is simply dying to be regaled with tales of your trip.\u201d\n\u201cI can\u2019t imagine I\u2019d have anything particularly exciting to share with her,\u201d Arnold said curtly.\nAfter the last few days, Rishe found this look of glazed apathy disturbing. His good looks only compounded it\u2014he was so handsome that every expression was stark.\nHe looks more like Emperor Arnold Hein now, but still not the same.\nArnold appeared to notice her watching him. When he looked at her, his sourness disappeared, replaced by a genuine smile. All around him, women found themselves flushing. Arnold paid no heed to their fervent gazes, instead leaning in to give Rishe a brief moment of consideration.\nThen he leaned in close enough to kiss her.\n\u201cA dull trip,\u201d he said again, pulling away. \u201cBut fortuitous. Without it, I would have never met the woman destined to be my wife.\u201d\nA shocked murmur rolled through the crowd. Rishe, who hadn\u2019t recovered from seeing Arnold\u2019s beautiful face at close range, barely noticed the looks of utter loathing the assembled women were throwing her.\n\u201cH-His Highness is smiling? At his hostage bride?\u201d\n\u201cHe called her his wife?! He\u2019s never even looked at us!\u201d\nThey were whispers, but they carried.\nA portly man stepped forward with his daughter in tow. \u201cYour Highness, do you mean to say that this lovely young woman is your fianc\u00e9e?\u201d\nEvery eye in the ballroom was on Rishe, alight with curiosity, envy, or schemes. None of them could hide their contempt. But Rishe didn\u2019t falter.\nThis is nothing compared to being publicly dumped in a banquet hall. And I\u2019ve done that seven times!\nShe offered a polite smile and an astoundingly correct curtsy. Left leg at a diagonal behind the right, back straight, head bowed. \u201cHow do you do? My name is Rishe Irmgard Weitzner.\u201d\nEven the most hostile guests could find nothing impolite in her greeting, no sign of rough manners from the rustic daughter of a backwater nation. Rishe had years of training in expectation of ascending to the throne. Occasionally, habits from her other lives slipped through, but Arnold appeared to be the only one who noticed.\nNow he was looking at her with satisfaction. \u201cLady Rishe has only just arrived, and her acquaintances are few and far between. I hope I can count on you all to hold me accountable should I prove an incompetent husband.\u201d\n\u201cB-but of course, Your Highness.\u201d\n\u201cCome, Rishe.\u201d Arnold guided her out of the ring of spectators. The stares continued to follow them as they walked away.\nRishe dropped her voice to a whisper. \u201cYou sure know how to invite the ire of women.\u201d\n\u201cWhatever do you mean?\u201d\n\u201cThe way you harped on about me. Everything you said was tailor-made to stoke their jealousy. You\u2019ve gained me enemies, so thanks for that.\u201d\nArnold snorted. \u201cEverything I said was to protect you from enemies. They need to know you aren\u2019t just some trophy they can eliminate without recourse. We need to show them this to forestall any potential moves against you in the future.\n\u201cShow them what, exactly?\u201d\n\u201cThat I\u2019ll protect you no matter what.\u201d\nHe said it with such nonchalance that it brought her up short. Protect me? Arnold Hein, protect me?\nSuch an ironic position to take. She couldn\u2019t tell him that, of course. Her response came out somewhat strangled. \u201cI doubt they\u2019ll be anything to worry about. In fact, the biggest threat facing me is you.\u201d\n\u201cOh? And why do you say that?\u201d\n\u201cFor many reasons, the most obvious being that I\u2019m no match for you with a blade.\u201d As much as it pained her to admit it.\nArnold looked pleased. \u201cPerhaps we should duel.\u201d\n\u201cYes, please! And if it wouldn\u2019t be an intrusion\u2014I would like to train with you.\u201d If she studied him, she could learn his strategies and his attack patterns. She\u2019d never be a match in speed or raw power, but any insight would be invaluable.\n\u201cSure.\u201d Arnold shrugged. \u201cI don\u2019t mind.\u201d\n\u201cTruly?\u201d Her eyes glittered with anticipation.\nHe chuckled. \u201cYour answers never disappoint me.\u201d\n\u201cWhat\u2019s that supposed to mean? Oh, it looks like they\u2019re playing a new song.\u201d\nA soft melody drifted across the hall. The crowd divided, heading toward the center of the floor or against the wall. The next dance was starting, and everyone was waiting to see what the crown prince and his new fianc\u00e9e would do.\n\u201cWe don\u2019t have to dance if you don\u2019t want to,\u201d Arnold said.\n\u201cOh? As it happens, I like dancing.\u201d Plus, she couldn\u2019t resist a blatant challenge. She offered him her hand.\n\u201cVery well, then.\u201d Arnold only hesitated for a moment before taking it and steering her gently to an empty spot on the floor. He didn\u2019t seem like the dancing type, but his movements were slick and effortless. Facing one another, they joined hands. Arnold wrapped his other arm around her waist. \nOoh. His hand felt huge against her back. She realized she was breathing a little faster. They\u2019d never been this close before.\nNo, that isn\u2019t quite true. This is the second time. Rishe\u2019s final memories from her last life flashed vividly through her mind.\nThis was indeed the second time they had been this close\u2014the first had ended with a sword through her chest.\nEmperor Arnold Hein had single-handedly decimated the knights in the castle. Rishe stood in the midst of the carnage, breath ragged as she gripped the hilt of her sword, slick with her own blood. She was the last line of defense. The chamber behind her housed the royal family.\nIf they could reach the hidden passageways, the young prince and his party could find shelter with their allies across the border. Rishe and the other knights were prepared to sacrifice their lives to allow the royal family to survive. Their escape meant victory.\nBells tolled out, urging flight. All is lost. Run. Rishe managed to graze Arnold\u2019s cheek with her blade before she looked down to find his jet-black sword blooming out of her chest.\nShe remembered how it burned, as if the blade was made of fire. It was heat, not pain, but her breathing grew labored, and when Emperor Arnold Hein withdrew his sword, Rishe crumpled. \nHe knelt by her side and whispered something.\nThe words were seared into her memory. Rishe squeezed Arnold\u2019s hand as they danced.\nI\u2019ll be the bully this time. \nRishe shifted her weight back, slipping out of the hold on her waist. She broke Arnold\u2019s lead and spun, drifting on the harmony of the dance. She took him by surprise; his eyes went wide.\nI wonder what you\u2019ll do when you\u2019re no longer on top, Your Highness. Her smile was a declaration of war. Watching him attempt to follow her lead would be delightful. She pulled his hand toward her, attempting to move them into a spin.\nBut Arnold held fast. He planted his hand on her waist and turned them in a different direction, using her inertia against her. Hey! As a result, Rishe twirled by herself on the spot.\nShe didn\u2019t miss a step. She turned elegantly, the hem of her dress whispering across the ballroom floor. She heard appreciative murmurs from the wallflowers lined up watching.\nDespite that, Rishe took it as a defeat. Round one to Arnold. \nSo\u2026you can think on your feet. How about this?\nArnold remained unruffled, evading her next scheme like it was nothing. He grinned down at her, his eyes shining with a dare.\nHe thinks I can\u2019t beat him. His ease vexed her, but it was his smugness that made her angry.\nShe let out a hard breath, attempting a maneuver to lure him in while turning. He leaned back, not falling for it at all.\nHe\u2019s just too good at changing his center of gravity! She kept her astonishment under wraps, but she felt it. Despite how close we\u2019re dancing, I can\u2019t throw off his timing at all. He\u2019s sidestepped all my attempts, and he takes back the lead the second I let down my guard!\nIt made her increasingly angry. She twirled and stepped as the dance dictated, all the while feeling out for moments of weakness. Arnold played along with her game, completely unruffled.\nEvery single time. I\u2019m doing my utmost to trip him up, but he doesn\u2019t even seem annoyed! At this point she\u2019d just settle for any reaction at all.\nTheir unusual dance style had gathered a crowd. Rishe paid them no mind, focused only on her goal. Then something occurred to her, and her breath caught in her throat.\nWait a minute, he has left an opening. It\u2019s the same one from before. She thought back to their fight to the death, to that moment when she had managed to draw blood. That may indeed have been his only weakness.\nIf I strike the same way\u2014huh? Before she could try, Arnold appeared to lose patience, wrapping his arm around her waist. He bent her back into a dip so deep it felt like he\u2019d pulled a carpet from under her feet. She yelped, grabbing at him reflexively, clinging tight. His big hands gripped her securely enough to mitigate the sensation of falling. Relief flooded through her, and she felt a laugh rumble against her ear.\nThe music came to an end with one last ringing note. She blinked. The dance is over?\nA hush fell over the ballroom. Then cheers broke out, followed by a round of applause.\n\u201cThat was incredible!\u201d\nThe watching nobles crowded in.\n\u201cYou two moved in such perfect harmony!\u201d\n\u201cI was on the edge of my seat. I felt like I was watching a sword duel!\u201d\n\u201cIs this a dance from Hermity? I\u2019ve never seen such steps before.\u201d\n\u201cUh, well\u2026\u201d Rishe floundered. She glanced up at Arnold, who appeared to be enjoying her struggle. She\u2019d get no help from him.\nRishe dealt with the barrage of questions as best she could, letting the crowd sweep them into the dining room, which was set up for a buffet-style meal. She made sure to greet every guest, riveting their faces into her memory.\nShe must have been acting peculiar, because Arnold eventually said, \u201cRishe, I think the wine is getting to you. Shall we get some fresh air?\u201d\nRishe hadn\u2019t touched a single drop. In fact, she\u2019d been caught up in so many conversations that she hadn\u2019t even had the chance to eat, but she had experience working on an empty stomach. She accepted Arnold\u2019s encouragement as the escape it was.\nJust when I least expect it, he\u2019ll act the gentleman. Maybe he\u2019d remembered her demand for a carefree life of doing nothing.\nRishe cast a charming look across the crowd. \u201cThank you for your consideration, Your Highness. Forgive me.\u201d She gave a polite bow before quietly slipping away. \nShe didn\u2019t head straight to the balcony but rather slowly walked around the hall. There was only so much she could find out glued to Arnold\u2019s side all night.\nI need information. Galkhein\u2019s political landscape was a mystery to me through all my past lives. I only know the rumors that made it abroad.\nAlthough she knew of Arnold\u2019s eventual patricide, she had no concept of the circumstances leading up to it. She needed a better picture of the factions and power balance inside the court. The lives these people led.\nI know better than to believe wartime gossip. This Arnold Hein is a lot different from what I\u2019d heard he was like at nineteen. He\u2019s not as diabolical as the rumors led me to believe. He likes to push, but he isn\u2019t unkind. The thought drifted across her mind, leaving her conflicted. Well, he\u2019s not unkind now. But I still don\u2019t like not knowing his motives. And he\u2019s a bit of a jerk, to be honest. \nShe tried to settle her mind and just observe. Gathering intelligence was necessary to lead a long, carefree life lazing around the palace.\nIf I recall correctly, that\u2019s Lord Hannawald. He seems to be on good terms with Count Gayle. Duke Hudemann and Duke Teinitz are having a friendly enough conversation, yet they don\u2019t seem close. Rishe ticked off the names of people she\u2019d met, committing them to memory.\nA wave of sweet perfume wafted over her. A pretty girl with soft blonde hair had appeared at her side. \u201cHow do you do, Lady Rishe? I\u2019m Cornelia Thea Toona.\u201d\nDuke Toona\u2019s family was the thirty-first house she\u2019d met tonight.\nRishe smiled graciously. \u201cRishe Irmgard Weitzner. A pleasure to meet you.\u201d\n\u201cThe pleasure is all mine.\u201d Cornelia smiled sweetly. Her eyes were big and bright, her lips full. She held a glass in each hand and offered one to Rishe. \u201cWine? I see you\u2019re empty-handed.\u201d\nA gaggle of other ladies nearby began giggling among themselves.\n\u201cHow dare she act so haughty when she\u2019s a captive. It\u2019s time for her learn just what she is. A pawn to be played and discarded.\u201d\n\u201cShe should enjoy her time on Prince Arnold\u2019s arm while she can.\u201d\n\u201cShe is from a minor nation, after all.\u201d\nAs Rishe took note of their whispers, Cornelia gazed at her with doe eyes. \u201cDoes my offering offend you in some way?\u201d\nIf I remember correctly, House Toona holds a vast territory in southern Galkhein.\nRishe held out a hand to accept the glass. \u201cHow could it? Thank you, Lady Cornelia.\u201d\nBefore Rishe could touch the glass, Cornelia gave a dramatic shout. \u201cOh dear! My hand slipped!\u201d She dropped it, quite obviously on purpose. Without thinking, Rishe grabbed her skirts and leaned back, plucking the glass out of the air with the other hand.\nCornelia let out a cry of surprise as Rishe caught the wine before any could spill. She swirled the glass and brought it to her nose to breathe in the bouquet.\nHmm\u2026 That\u2019s mashed capsicum. Where did she even get that? What a waste of perfectly good wine. And why bother spicing it enough to singe the tongue if she just planned to ruin my dress? Pick a plan, my dear.\nHiding her exasperation, Rishe smiled brightly. \u201cI\u2019ve never had a wine quite like this. What an unusual scent.\u201d\nCornelia bit her lip in frustration. Rishe beamed at her. You\u2019ve got such a pretty face, Lady Toona. Why don\u2019t you smile?\nRishe leaned in close to Cornelia. \u201cThis vintage isn\u2019t available where I\u2019m from. I\u2019m ever so anxious to learn more. Should I perhaps invite Prince Arnold over to enjoy a glass? Which tray did you get this from?\u201d\n\u201cWhat? Oh, um\u2026\u201d Rishe had a policy of never backing down from a fight, but it seemed Cornelia didn\u2019t share it. \u201cS-sorry, but I don\u2019t remember. Such a large hall, you see.\u201d\n\u201cA shame. I\u2019ll just give His Highness this one, then. I\u2019ll be sure to let him know who it\u2019s from.\u201d\n\u201cUh, wait!\u201d Cornelia rapidly shook her head. \u201cI-I got that glass for you, so I think you should\u2014you know what? Never",
    "query_text": " mind! Maybe I should just take that\u2014oh no!\u201d\nRishe ignored the ashen-faced Cornelia, raising the glass and swallowing down a gulp. \n\u201cI-I can\u2019t believe\u2026\u201d\n\u201cSuch a spicy flavor, just as I imagined.\u201d Rishe smiled again to the assembled group\u2019s astonishment. \u201cWhat a warm welcome. I do hope the two of us can spend more time"

But the stop at her house took time, and she missed them completely.\nIn that moment, Rishe made a stark realization. Different choices meant different mistakes. Opening one door would close another.\nAnd so the easy path to a life in commerce was closed to her.\nSure, she could try to build her business from the ground up, but personal connections were almost as essential to being a merchant as business savvy. It just wasn\u2019t realistic without a single acquaintance. \nSorting through her belongings in resignation, she came across a foreign encyclopedia of herbs among her grandmother\u2019s books. Taking it as a sign, Rishe sold her jewels elsewhere and used the funds to cross the sea and pursue the study of medicine.\nFortunately, Ris"

It continues to the top of my shoulder and pulls the skin taut.\u201d\n\u201cHow awful.\u201d Rishe couldn\u2019t help but reach out to gingerly touch the nape of his neck.\nArnold accepted her touch without a word. She\u2019d half expected to be slapped aside.\nHer fingers slowly traced the shape of it. She could feel the rough skin through her gloves.\nHe must have gotten this over a decade ago. Someone stabbed him\u2014and not just once or twice. They must have done it over and over to make this scar pattern.\nHer medical training had her shuddering at the image of a nine-year-old Arnold ashen and trembling with blood loss. The fact that he\u2019d survived and retained the use of his arm was incredible. And then to go on to wield a sword so skillfully\u2014his suffering must have been immense.\n\u201cOnly a few people know about this injury. You\u2019re the first to notice on your own.\u201d\n\u201cHow did it happen?\u201d\nThat grim smile returned as he looked down at Rishe. With the moon hanging behind him, he was as opaque as ever, but Rishe understood the sentiment.\nI shouldn\u2019t pry.\nRishe pulled her hand away, and that ominous smile that sent chills down her spine disappeared. Arnold put his jacket back in order, reclasping it at the neck.\nSomeone tried to kill Arnold Hein about ten years ago. But who and why? Rishe cast her eyes down as she ruminated. The most obvious beneficiaries of a dead crown prince would be potential heirs and those loyal to them. I believe Arnold has a younger brother, but I haven\u2019t met him yet.\nOdd. Rishe might be a hostage, but shouldn\u2019t she meet her future relatives? Perhaps it was Arnold\u2019s doing and not the will of the imperial family themselves. He didn\u2019t seem to want to involve her in anything unless it was absolutely necessary\u2014he hadn\u2019t told her about this ball, after all. \nRishe looked up at him. \u201cYour Highness, may I select my maids some time over the next few days?\u201d \n\u201cVery well. I\u2019ll tell Oliver to make that a priority.\u201d\n\u201cAh, I can do the selection myself. We needn\u2019t trouble him.\u201d\nArnold arched an amused brow. Gone was that unsettling smile, replaced with his easy manner. \u201cWhat are you planning this time?\u201d\n\u201cOh, nothing important,\u201d Rishe said. She picked up her empty glass. \u201cI\u2019m merely concerned about the servants\u2019 working conditions.\u201d\nTo protect her life and well-being, she needed to keep from dying at twenty years old again. And to do that, she had to prevent Arnold Hein\u2019s war. Her best bet would be to appeal to the important people she\u2019d known in her past lives. People with influence.\nPlus, there was a mountain of things she needed to do in preparation for the marriage ceremony.\nI need to sow a plot of land, grow herbs, do lots of shopping, get cheap alcohol, and then\u2026 \nRishe began a to-do list that had nothing to do with war in the least.\n \n***\n \nAs the ball wound to a close, a lone boy stood in the gloomy courtyard of the imperial palace. He had soft black hair and round blue eyes. No older than sixteen, he had an androgynous grace to him, gaze fixed on the balcony above. \nHe was watching a girl.\nShe had coral-colored hair, and even from this distance, he could tell she was beautiful. She stood there alone, apparently waiting for someone. Whoever it was must have shown up because her hand slipped from the banister, and she stepped away. Not too long after, a man appeared where she had been standing.\nThe man turned a silent glare down into the garden, as if he\u2019d known the boy had been there the whole time, despite the shadows.\nA shiver ran down the boy\u2019s spine and he smiled reflexively, delighting in the intense aura of threat the man gave off. It was just a warning, it seemed, as the man abruptly turned on his heel and disappeared. \n\u201cAww, we can\u2019t play together either?\u201d The boy hung his head. \u201cI miss you, Brother.\u201d\nIt had to be the woman. The beauty. She\u2019d made the boy\u2019s life hell since the day she arrived. \nHis brother had prohibited him from attending balls like this one. That was fine; he\u2019d sooner avoid them altogether. Still, he\u2019d wanted to meet that girl. \n\u201cBut we\u2019ll meet soon enough, won\u2019t we?\u201d He spoke to himself in a soft voice. \u201cI\u2019ve got plans for you, Sister.\u201d \n\n(2) chapter number given is likely out of range: 0\nChapter: 8\n\nChapter 3\nChapter 3\n \n\u201cYOU\u2019RE ALL SO USELESS!\u201d Diana the redheaded maid\u2019s voice rang out inside the stone washhouse. \nThree days had passed since the afternoon Rishe shook off her guard and came out to the well. Rishe was once again dressed to fit in with the maids. At Diana\u2019s shout, she looked up without pausing in her work. \n\u201cIs even laundry beyond your capabilities? I asked you to wash these this morning, and now it\u2019s past noon! Meanwhile, we\u2019ve finished cleaning the entire first floor in a third of the time!\u201d\n\u201cI-I\u2019m sorry, Diana.\u201d\nThe new maids went silent with shame. Among them was Elsie, the girl Rishe stood up for the other day. Rishe pulled her hands out of the soapy water, gently rinsed them, and said, \u201cLet me help. What still needs to be done?\u201d\n\u201cYou again?\u201d Diana rounded on Rishe. \u201cI don\u2019t know who you serve, but I\u2019m amazed you have the time to do other people\u2019s work. I wish I had so much free time.\u201d\nHuffily, she turned from Rishe. \u201cLet\u2019s just ignore these useless fools. Laura, Maya. Come on. If we want to be chosen as Lady Rishe\u2019s maids, we mustn\u2019t waste our time.\u201d\nDiana took out a slip of paper from her pocket, smoothing it out. \u201cIt looks like the new bedsheets for her palace will arrive today. We should inspect them to make sure everything is perfect!\u201d\n\u201cWait up, Diana!\u201d\nThe two maids followed Diana out. Rishe waited for the door to close before turning to Elsie and the others. \u201cLet\u2019s keep working. If there\u2019s anything too large and cumbersome, feel free to pass it over to me.\u201d\n\u201cTh-thank you so much!\u201d The new maids went weak with gratitude. One of them, a girl on the verge of tears, even fell into a full bow. Rishe muttered encouragement as she scrubbed some bedsheets.\nElsie, who was washing the sheets with her, wore a rueful look. \u201cI\u2019m so sorry for the trouble. We\u2019re just not learning fast enough.\u201d\n\u201cYou haven\u2019t been working here long, have you? It takes time to learn a new job, no matter who you are,\u201d Rishe said as she kept scrubbing. \u201cAnd it\u2019s not like you\u2019ve never washed a single thing in your life before, right?\u201d\nElsie nodded nervously. \nRishe had realized over the past few days doing the laundry that not all the newcomers were complete amateurs. They\u2019d obviously done chores at home, or something similar. When set a specific task, they could perform it properly, but Diana\u2019s complaints weren\u2019t unfounded. They did take far too much time with laundry.\nBut it\u2019s obvious why. \u201cDo you know anything about Diana?\u201d Rishe asked Elsie. \u201cLike, is she from a well-off family?\u201d\nElsie said, \u201cI heard that her father was a business owner. She worked with him.\u201d\n\u201cI heard that as well,\u201d added another maid. \u201cBut he fell into debt and had to sell off.\u201d \nRishe stopped scrubbing for a moment to consider this.\n\u201cUm, is something the matter?\u201d Elsie asked.\nRishe smiled and shook her head. \u201cNo, nothing. Let\u2019s just focus on getting these washed for the time being.\u201d\n \n***\n \nThat afternoon, thirty maids were assembled in the detached wing of the palace. Ten of them were old hands, long in service to the royal family, while the other twenty were freshly hired. The crown princess was to choose her maids from among these thirty. They wore their nerves plainly on their sleeves. \n\u201cHey, I thought this palace was in a terrible state of neglect,\u201d one maid whispered. \u201cWhy is it so sparkling clean?\u201d\n\u201cYeah, you\u2019re right,\u201d said another. \u201cSomeone must have sorted it out before we arrived.\u201d\n\u201cI wonder what kind of person Lady Rishe is. Ooh, I\u2019m so nervous.\u201d\nThe girls looked around anxiously.\n\u201cHey, Elsie, that girl who was always helping us isn\u2019t here.\u201d\nElsie blinked. \u201cYou\u2019re right.\u201d\n\u201cLook, Diana. That impertinent newbie didn\u2019t get picked.\u201d \nAt her friend\u2019s observation, Diana preened with satisfaction. \u201cNo surprise there. You need some manners to attend to Lady Rishe. I bet she got kicked out of the running!\u201d Her eyes sparkled with confidence.\nAt last, there was a knock at the door.\n\u201cHer Royal Highness, Princess Rishe.\u201d\nThe maids quickly fell into bows. Diana\u2019s chest ached with anticipation as heels clicked on the floor, approaching the line of girls. From the corner of their eyes, the maids saw a wide-skirted court dress. A gentle scent washed over them.\nWithout even looking at her, they could tell Crown Princess Rishe was a lovely woman. Diana and her friends swelled with pride that she was to become their mistress.\nBut then Laura whispered to Diana, \u201cHey, isn\u2019t this scent familiar?\u201d\n\u201cQuiet!\u201d Clearly it was some sort of expensive perfume. Or so Diana thought, but then she realized what it was. The words just slipped out. \u201cIt\u2019s soap.\u201d\n\u201cHuh? Did you just say something?\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s soap. The same kind we always use.\u201d Diana was sure of it.\nThe princess said, \u201cPlease rise.\u201d \nWhy did her voice sound so familiar? An incredible foreboding gripping her, Diana looked up. She gasped.\n\u201cMy name is Rishe Irmgard Weitzner.\u201d\nBefore her stood the beautiful newcomer\u2014the thorn in her side for the past few days. The smile she wore was peaceful and just the slightest bit satisfied.\n \n***\n \nI\u2019m so glad I managed to finish washing the sheets in time!\nStanding before the maids with Arnold\u2019s attendant Oliver at her side, Rishe was panicking on the inside. She\u2019d had so much to do this morning that she\u2019d put off the laundry to the last minute. She took deep, controlled breaths, praying no one would notice that she\u2019d raced here at a dead sprint.\nOliver was none the wiser as he spoke to the assembled girls. Rishe took the opportunity to look them over. She locked eyes with Elsie, who was gaping at her. It was a nice change\u2014usually her face was as blank as a rock wall.\nI\u2019m sorry for the deception. I figured blending in would give me the best picture of your working conditions.\nThe new maids wore similarly shocked expressions, while others watched her with delight. Meanwhile, the veterans, including Diana, had all gone pale. They trembled, stunned into silence. One seemed locked in a terrifying trance, while another looked on the verge of tears. All of them had spoken to Rishe with derision. As the ringleader, Diana was covering her mouth with both hands, like she was holding in a scream.\nOliver had finished his introduction. \u201cYour Highness, if you would?\u201d\nRishe stepped forward. \u201cFirst, I must apologize to you for what has transpired prior to this meeting. My deception, that is. However, it has granted me insight into how each one of you works.\u201d\nOliver\u2019s face creased in confusion. The newcomer maids began to panic, whispering among themselves.\n\u201cDoesn\u2019t this mean that she helped us out with the laundry?\u201d\n\u201cWe\u2019re going to be fired!\u201d\n\u201cIf I lose my position, my brother will have to quit school!\u201d\nNoticing the commotion, Oliver glanced at Rishe. \u201cYour Highness, two-thirds of these maids are newly recruited from the city. Since the majority of the castle maids were elderly, His Highness assumed you would prefer maids closer in age to yourself.\u201d\nRishe was startled. She had found it odd that most of her potential servants were new hires, but she hadn\u2019t expected this to be the reason.\n\u201cWhile the prince has entrusted the selection of your maids to you,\u201d Oliver went on. \u201cHiring someone with no experience will not do. Despite Prince Arnold\u2019s views, I urge you to reject the newcomers.\u201d\n\u201cOliver.\u201d\n\u201cI have a list of their names here. Elsie\u2014\u201d\n\u201cElsie, Nichole, Hilde, Marguerite, Rosa.\u201d Rishe began listing the names of the newly recruited maids. She\u2019d made a point to memorize them in the washhouse. \u201cElke, Amelia, and\u2014\u201d\nOliver looked at her wildly. \u201cYou know them all?! Even though they\u2019ve never served you in the past?\u201d\n\u201cYes, of course I do. Servants are essential to the maintenance of our lifestyle, why wouldn\u2019t I get to know them?\u201d Rishe listed the remaining names for good measure. \u201cAll twenty of you, listen to me.\u201d \nThe new maids stiffened. Diana and the other maids whose names hadn\u2019t been called were getting their wind back, wearing increasingly triumphant looks.\nRishe said, \u201cThe twenty names I just called will be my maids.\u201d\nTime seemed to stand still a moment, and then Oliver broke in with an astonished, \u201cB-but, my lady! They are all inexperienced\u2014\u201d\n\u201cYes. And my palace will be the perfect place to learn.\u201d\nThe new recruits were completely speechless, unsure of exactly what was happening. \nRishe smiled at Elsie. \u201cI hope you\u2019ll serve me well, Elsie.\u201d\nElsie was still frozen in place. \u201cHuh? Y-yes, my lady, but\u2014\u201d\nA shaking Diana cried out, \u201cBut why, my lady?! You\u2019ve seen their work! They\u2019re useless, the lot of them! The rest of us get so much more done in a shorter amount of time!\u201d\n\u201cWatch your tongue, girl,\u201d Oliver said sharply.\nDiana ignored him. \u201cWe\u2019re hard workers! Any job you assign us, we can do it! Please, I beg you, my lady!\u201d\n\u201cStep back,\u201d Oliver warned. \u201cDo not take a single step closer to Lady Rishe.\u201d\nDiana spoke in a rush, words pouring out of her. \u201cI-I freely admit that I was impolite before, but I didn\u2019t know who she was! I\u2019ll take any punishment, so please, give me the chance to show you how well I can work!\u201d\nRishe said, \u201cDiana, I have a request.\u201d\n\u201cTh-thank you, my lady!\u201d Diana heaved a sigh of relief. \u201cYou mean you\u2019ll\u2014\u201d \nRishe cut across her. \u201cAs of today, you are no longer a maid in this palace.\u201d \n\u201cWhat?\u201d Her face, usually so fixed with determination, paled. \u201cBut why? I\u2019m so much better than any of them! I\u2019ll do a perfect job no matter what task you set before me. Please don\u2019t dismiss me, my lady!\u201d \n\u201cListen to me, Diana.\u201d Rishe dropped her lofty tone, speaking as one woman would to another. \u201cYou have noticed it, haven\u2019t you? No matter what you claim, these new girls aren\u2019t",
    "query_text": " worthless.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2026I don\u2019t understand.\u201d\n\u201cCan you remember your first month in service? How difficult it was?\u201d\nDiana looked completely bewildered. Her gaze darted around as if looking for help.\nPulling herself together, she forced herself to follow Rishe\u2019s directions. She thought back and finally alighted on a response. \u201cI\u2026I didn\u2019t know how to do the job. Before, when my family was still prominent"

You are a vile woman! A truly malicious creature unworthy of the crown prince! As of this instant, our engagement is off!\u201d\nNaturally, she didn\u2019t understand what was going on at first. She looked around. Everything was the same. She stood in the same place wearing the same dress and draped in the same jewelry she\u2019d sold to the caravan.\nWas it a dream? Or was everything that had happened up until then the dream? In her confusion, all she could do was stare.\nRishe hurried out of the ballroom, the impending threat of exile hanging over her and the prince\u2019s entreaties to halt ringing in her ears.\nThis is perfect! Now I can get it right! I\u2019ll grab everything valuable from my room.\nRishe had enjoyed her life as a merchant, but she had always felt a stirring of regret about this night. If only she\u2019d brought some funds from home, she would\u2019ve had the capital to establish her business much sooner!\nSpeaking of this regret always prompted disbelief from her customers, including the king of the desert. \u201cWhat? That\u2019s what you\u2019d want to do over?!\u201d\nWhen she arrived back at home on the night of her second life, Rishe grabbed her jewelry box and as many of the books her late grandmother had left her as she could carry, then made haste to the forest to meet the caravan. But the stop at her house took time, and she missed them completely.\nIn that moment, Rishe made a stark realization. Different choices meant different mistakes. Opening one door would close another.\nAnd so the easy path to a life in commerce was closed to her.\nSure, she could try to build her business from the ground up, but personal connections were almost as essential to being a merchant as business savvy. It just wasn\u2019t realistic without a single acquaintance. \nSorting through her belongings in resignation, she came across a foreign encyclopedia of herbs among her grandmother\u2019s books. Taking it as a sign, Rishe sold her jewels elsewhere and used the funds to cross the sea and pursue the study of medicine.\nFortunately, Rishe retained all her knowledge from her previous life. She remembered that certain expensive herbs could be acquired cheaply in other regions. When word spread of a disease running rampant in a neighboring country, she recalled that too. This foreknowledge proved invaluable, as did her wide travel and exposure to many different teachers with many different points of view.\nAs such, Rishe led a successful life as an apothecary. She saved a feeble prince, synthesized a number of rare medicines with her mercantile knowledge, and thus spent her days in the simple joy of helping those in need.\nUnfortunately, all the joy in the world couldn\u2019t stand up to an epidemic. Thus ended her second life. \nOnce again, she found herself in the moment of her broken engagement, the curtain rising on the third loop. Her next four lives proceeded much the same way. As a skilled lady\u2019s maid, she helped a young noblewoman to a fortuitous marriage. Once, she even disguised herself as a man and became a knight. Every life was worth living, and she enjoyed them all. She enjoyed living, period.\nThere was just one problem.\nNo matter what I do, I die at twenty.\nShe enjoyed her lives, but she was not permitted to do so for long. With this time limit always hanging over her, she spent each loop in a state of constant activity.\nI would love to take it easy for a while. Is a little leisure time too much to ask? Obviously I don\u2019t want to die either! This time, I\u2019ll make as much money as I can in the first five years. Then, when I turn twenty, I\u2019ll live a life free of worldly cares. I\u2019ll do whatever\u2019s necessary to stay alive!\nHer mind made up, Rishe began her seventh life in a dead sprint through the palace. Regardless of her future plans, she was in a race against time. She needed to beat the messenger bearing news of her scandal.\nAs she ran, she yanked off her hair ornaments; she planned to sell them and didn\u2019t want to risk losing one. Her hair billowed out behind her, falling in loose waves.\nSuddenly, an idea occurred to her, one she hadn\u2019t had in any of her previous six lives.\nLeaving through the palace gardens would be faster. I can climb down a tree from the balcony.\nRishe had gone to war as a knight in the life just before this one. After the punishing battlefield training, climbing trees was nothing.\nSeamlessly, she changed direction. She raced for the balcony, where she ran into something at full speed.\n\u201cBwargh!\u201d Rishe let out a very unladylike grunt, staggering a few steps. She looked up to see what she\u2019d bounced off of. \u201cOh\u2026\u201d\nAn exceptionally handsome man stood in her path.\nHe had refined, patrician features and cruel, thin lips. He was slender yet powerful; even through his clothes, Rishe could tell his body was well conditioned. His jet-black hair covered his ears, creeping down to the nape of his neck. The tips of his locks bounced with his movements. They looked to be soft to the touch.\nFrom head to toe, he was a pleasure to look at\u2014but what held Rishe\u2019s attention were his eyes. They were long in shape and impossibly blue, but they possessed a blade-sharp intensity. His gaze was clear, beautiful, and cold as ice. His eyelashes cast shadows on his striking face. He was a work of art.\nCurrently, this work of art was staring her down with a look that could kill.\nHe laughed. \u201cYou barreled right into me. For a moment, I thought I\u2019d been attacked by a wild boar.\u201d\nIt was an exceedingly rude thing to say to a stranger, but as luck would have it, this man was not a stranger. At least not to Rishe.\n\u201cWhat are you even doing here?\u201d the man went on. \u201cThe party is in the\u2014\u201d\nRishe interrupted him with a wordless shout of dismay. The man drew back, reflexively reaching for his sword. He composed himself with visible difficulty. \u201cWho are you? You look like any noblewoman, but your manner is\u2026\u201d \n\u201cEmperor Arnold Hein!\u201d \nThe man\u2019s eyes widened. He didn\u2019t mistake her surging contempt. Rishe had crossed swords with this man. Recently. He was the one responsible for ending her sixth life. \nHe must be a guest at the banquet. It makes sense.\nArnold Hein was the scion of a military nation not far from Rishe\u2019s home country of Hermity, the one in which they now stood. Their kingdoms, so recently at war, had brokered an ostensible peace, and the two ruling families met from time to time. Crown Prince Dietrich\u2019s engagement party would be one such occasion. He\u2019d gathered elites from far and wide to introduce to his beloved Mary.\nThe man eyed Rishe with rising curiosity. \u201cYou know me? This is my first time in Hermity.\u201d\nUh-oh. Rishe pasted on a smile as her mind spun in circles. This man was dangerous. She had to avoid entanglements with him at all costs. Five years from now, Arnold Hein would invade Hermity. \nHe was an extraordinarily skilled swordsman and, with a powerful military at his back, was destined to conquer kingdom after kingdom. He had done as much in her second, third, fourth, and fifth lives. In her sixth, Rishe had faced him in battle herself and died by his hand.\nWe never had a chance. That war was lost before it began.\nArnold\u2019s brilliance lay not in his swordplay but in his skill as a tactician. He set countries up for conquest and knocked them down, swallowing them one by one.\nI know him, but he doesn\u2019t know me. We haven\u2019t met in this life. I need an excuse fast. \nRishe curtsied slowly. \u201cMy name is Rishe Irmgard Weitzner. We\u2019ve never been introduced, but I\u2019ve heard of you.\u201d\nArnold donned an amused smile. \u201cYou plant your weight like a trained swordswoman. Your center of gravity is perfect.\u201d\n\u201cYou exaggerate,\u201d Rishe demurred. \u201cThat was simply a curtsy to an esteemed guest.\u201d \n\u201cI must have misheard, but I swear you called me \u2018emperor\u2019 just now.\u201d \nRishe froze.\n\u201cMy father yet lives,\u201d Arnold said. \u201cI am simply a crown prince. Why would you call me that?\u201d \n\u201cUh, um\u2026\u201d Rishe floundered for an answer.\nShe\u2019d made such a foolish mistake. Arnold\u2019s gaze cut right through her. It felt like he\u2019d see through any lie she told right down to her soul. She remembered this from the battlefield\u2014how his attention alone felt like a sword thrust.\nBut why even bother to lie? They\u2019d never meet again, so who cared what he thought of her? Sure, she harbored a hard feeling or two over the recent slaying, but there was no point complaining about it to this Arnold. Calling him the emperor was boorish, but Rishe was in the process of being forcibly exiled. Why play at diplomacy?\nShe took a deep breath and bowed low. This was not the curtsy of a noble lady but of a servant bowing in supplication to her master.\n\u201cMy humblest apologies, Your Highness. I was in a rush. Such a rude slip of the tongue.\u201d She raised her head. \u201cMy ex-fianc\u00e9 just annulled our engagement, so I\u2019ve got a lot on my mind. If you would excuse me.\u201d \n\u201cHe annulled your engagement?\u201d\nAt that, Rishe turned and fled.\nThis unexpected run-in with Arnold had taken up valuable time. She threw open the door to the balcony and hiked up her skirts, kicking off her shoes in anticipation of jumping into a tree. Looking down, she realized the ground was far closer than she\u2019d feared.\nExcellent! I can just drop into the garden!\nArnold, who up until now had been rendered speechless, shook himself out of his fugue as Rishe clambered over the railing. \u201cHey!\u201d\nRishe\u2019s moonlight-silver dress flowed around her as she leapt. The lawn was soft, but the fall was still far enough to risk injury.\nWeight evenly distributed on the soles of my feet, roll to transfer the impact to my shins and thighs, then onto my hips and my back.\nShe landed safely, rolled nimbly in her dress, and popped back up. Her hair was covered in leaves. \nI need to hurry up!\nBracing against a nearby rock, she used her weight to snap the heels off of her shoes. There. That would make running a little easier. Satisfied, she slipped them back on and made haste toward the family estate. \n \n***\n \nUp on the balcony, Crown Prince Arnold of Galkhein watched the spectacle play out from beginning to end. He gazed at the girl with the coral hair. Her appearance was that of any young noblewoman, but she moved like a well-trained knight. She\u2019d leapt from the balcony and landed skillfully, showing no signs of distress at her ripped dress or disheveled hair. Instead, she\u2019d knocked the heels off her shoes and dashed away.\nAlso, she had called him an emperor.\nPlaying it all over again in his head, Arnold broke out into a rare chuckle. As his shoulders quivered with laughter, his attendant approached him from behind.\n\u201cThere you are, Your Highness. What are you doing out here? I\u2019m aware you don\u2019t desire a wife, but beginning the search would be wise\u2026 Er, Your Highness?\u201d The attendant\u2019s eyes flew wide. His bored and scowling master was laughing. \u201cDid something happen?\u201d\n\u201cOliver, ready my coach. Wait, no. That will take too much time. Bring me a horse.\u201d\n\u201cAt once, Your Highness. Might I ask why?\u201d\nArnold didn\u2019t respond\u2014he just grinned like a hungry wolf catching scent of his prey.\n \n***\n \nOnce outside the palace gates, Rishe threw herself into the waiting coach, shouting for the driver to make haste. She stopped it a few hundred yards from the manor and bid him farewell. \u201cI\u2019m leaving! Thanks for always being such a safe driver, Daniel!\u201d\nThe road to the manor was muddy from a morning rain shower. She knew from her second life that the coach would get stuck, resulting in a loss of valuable time. It was better to just get out and run. \n\u201cHuff, huff.\u201d Despite her last life\u2019s physical conditioning, this body had no stamina. She\u2019d need to try to get fitter faster this time around.\nRishe reached the end of the road, and her heart promptly sank all the way to her feet. \u201cOh no.\u201d\nThe front door was thronged with people, all of them surrounding a carriage bearing the royal family\u2019s coat of arms.\nI need to get out of here.\nWhile she stood frozen in indecision, one of the knights doing crowd control shouted, \u201cYour Highness! I have eyes on Lady Rishe!\u201d\n\u201cGet out of my way!\u201d A familiar voice started up a bellow. \u201cLet me through! Rishe, how dare you make me wait so long?\u201d\nRishe\u2019s ex-fianc\u00e9, Crown Prince Dietrich, stepped triumphantly forward.\n\u201cI know the thought of hearing your crimes enumerated",
    "query_text": " by the man you love must pain you, but alas, as future king, it is my duty to bring down the hammer of justice upon a villainess such as yourself!\u201d\n\u201cI see I\u2019ve timed it badly,\u201d Rishe muttered. \u201cIn fact, this is my worst loop yet. I\u2019d rather be barred from the house than see you again.\u201d\n\u201cHmm? What are you grumbling about?\u201d Dietrich looked Rishe up and down. \u201cI knew it. You put on a brave face, but I can sense the sorrow in your heart.\u201d\n\u201cI beg your pardon?\u201d\n\u201cYour heart!\u201d the prince repeated. \u201cYour heart! It must be absolutely crushed! Because I called off our engagement!\u201d\nRishe wasn\u2019t sure where he was drawing these conclusions from. Possibly the same place he mined for all his bottomless self-confidence.\n\u201cI can tell you\u2019ve been wandering aimlessly, distraught,\u201d the prince went on. \u201cLook at you. Your dress"

    "prefix_text": " have some skill.\u201d\nMetal screeched and slid, before Arnold sheathed his sword. Rishe lowered hers. Neither looked away.\n\u201cWho the hell are you?\u201d demanded one of the knights.\n\u201cStand down, good sirs,\u201d Rishe said. \u201cYour interference will only make this worse.\u201d\nThis mostly served to befuddle the knights further. Rishe absolutely couldn\u2019t allow them to come to blows with the crown prince of a friendly nation. And they couldn\u2019t beat him\u2014not even if they took him all at once. Rishe had blocked his blow, but her arm was completely numb. To think he\u2019d be even more powerful in five years.\nHe regarded her unabashedly. \u201cRishe, was that your name? Where did you learn such swordsmanship?\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m afraid I cannot say. Besides, you were clearly going easy on me.\u201d\n\u201cHa! You could tell?\u201d\nArnold\u2019s manner was throwing her off. He seemed to be enjoying himself. He\u2019s laughing. This monstrous prince is\u2026actually laughing.\nWhen she had met him in her other life, he was cold and merciless, like a genuine monster. And yet here he stood, mellow and smiling.\nThe Emperor Arnold Hein I knew was twenty-four years old, so he\u2019s, what? Nineteen now? This is so weird. He\u2019s grinning like a boy getting into a scrape.\nThat attack had been good-natured as well, almost playful. It had muscle behind it but certainly not any lethal intent. He\u2019d just wanted to force Rishe to catch the blow. She found it unbelievable that he could exude such an overpowering air of menace when he was just messing around.\nWhile Rishe was focused on Arnold, Mary and Dietrich caught up, seemingly recovered.\n\u201cExcuse me, my lord!\u201d Mary squeaked. \u201cI-I-I don\u2019t know who you are, but kindly step away from Lady Rishe!\u201d\n\u201cYes, do as she says! Who the hell are you, anyway?!\u201d\nDon\u2019t tell me Prince Dietrich doesn\u2019t recognize one of his personal guests.\nDietrich\u2019s interests did not lean toward diplomacy; he likely hadn\u2019t bothered to introduce himself to Arnold. Mary, for her part, seemed to grasp that Arnold wasn\u2019t ordinary. She stood up to defend Rishe, despite the tremble in her voice. In a better world, perhaps the two of them could have become friends.\n\u201cThat\u2019s your ex-fianc\u00e9?\u201d Arnold cocked a brow. \u201cHe\u2019s even worse than I imagined. Pathetic.\u201d\nDietrich flushed. \u201cI\u2019ll have your head!\u201d\n\u201cDietrich, I beg of you, contain yourself,\u201d Rishe said, then rounded on Arnold. \u201cAs for you, Your Highness\u2014you know who Dietrich is, and you know what speaking carelessly could mean. Are you trying to pick a fight?\u201d\n\u201cWhatever do you mean?\u201d Arnold\u2019s brows lifted high, making him the picture of innocence. \u201cBelieve me, Lady Rishe, every word I speak is chosen with extreme care.\u201d\nFinally realizing who Arnold was, Dietrich visibly paled. \u201cArnold? He\u2019s the crown prince of Galkhein?\u201d\nMary yelped. The knights stood down, shamefaced. The gossip-hungry neighbors who\u2019d gathered to witness a scandal play out drew back in fear.\n\u201cHe\u2019s the demon prince? The one who single-handedly destroyed a whole order of enemy knights?\u201d\n\u201cWatch your tongue, fool! Do you want him to do the same to you?\u201d\nThe two nations enjoyed peaceful relations, but Arnold remained the dreaded prince, heir to the throne of a former enemy. Current rumor wasn\u2019t as widespread as it would be in five years, but he was still regarded with distrust.\nThe onlookers stood rooted to the spot, too terrified to flee.\nWell, this has devolved into a full-fledged disaster.\nRishe heaved a frustrated sigh. \u201cPrince Arnold, to what do we owe this honor? Surely a crown prince would not draw his sword for a mere jest.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m here on business,\u201d Arnold said. \u201cBut first, I must beg forgiveness for my rudeness.\u201d\nHuh, what do you know? Once he became emperor, he\u2019d gladly behead any subject who so much as dared speak a word against him.\nI guess at nineteen he still knew how to apologize.\nIf that surprised her, Arnold\u2019s next act completely obliterated her sense of reality. \nWith a flourish, he fell to his knees. \n\u201cHuh?\u201d Is this actually happening? \nHe was a man destined for an imperial crown. A man who would stand at the head of a military powerhouse and spread his rule across continents.\nArnold, known for his frigid pride, knelt to the disgraced daughter of a duke.\nAnd not only that\u2014his head was bowed, looking nothing so much as a knight swearing allegiance to his lady. If it were anyone else, it would be a delightful, pious image. Instead, the assembled looked on in terrified awe.\nNot Rishe, though.\n\u201cWhat are you doing?\u201d she hissed. \u201cGet up!\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m apologizing for my baseless impertinence. Also, I\u2019m asking you\u2026\u201d He trailed off to take Rishe\u2019s hand, tugging her forward so forcefully she staggered. He gazed up at her.\nUgh. He\u2019s so beautiful. No matter how many times she looked at him, it didn\u2019t become any less disarming. Long eyelashes, arched brows, a noble nose. His bright blue eyes reminded her of the drift ice she\u2019d seen in a northern kingdom, gazing out from a ship in one of her past lives. She knew she was dwelling on this to buy time, even as the reality before her sank in.\n\u201c\u2026to become my wife.\u201d\nShe froze, unable to process the words. \u201cWhat?\u201d Rishe glanced around, desperately searching the faces of the crowd. They all seemed as stunned as she felt. She looked down at Arnold again. \u201cYour wife?\u201d \n\u201cYes, that\u2019s right.\u201d\n\u201cYou want me to become your wife?\u201d\n\u201cYes.\u201d\nRishe couldn\u2019t speak. This was truly happening. It was real. It clicked into place in her head, and she let out a strangled grunt.\nWhat is going on? Why is this happening?\nShock lapped at her, fuzzing at the corners of her vision. He wanted to marry her. Arnold wanted to marry Rishe. Her murderer wanted to marry her.\nWhy is he doing this? He must have some ulterior motive, a broader goal. But I have to give him an answer.\nThe onlookers were holding their breath as Rishe said flatly, \u201cI reject your proposal.\u201d\nArnold said nothing.\nShe had to reject him. She was going to live a long, peaceful, carefree life, damn it, and no one would stop her. And yet\u2026\nArnold began to laugh, and the deep, creeping sense of dread inside Rishe only grew. Why does he seem so amused by this?!\n \n***\n \nHer previous life was her sixth. Disguised as a man, Rishe rose as a warrior of an island country she came upon in her travels. It was a conventional yet charming kingdom formed of red brick. After striking up a friendship with a group of knights who didn\u2019t realize she was a woman, Rishe followed their advice and joined them.\nThe training was grueling enough to make her wish she were dead. Back when she had lived as a noble, she\u2019d learned how to wield a sword for basic self-defense, but training as a noble lady had in no way prepared her for this. She drilled relentlessly, barely taking the time to sleep. Just as she became a full-fledged knight, Emperor Arnold\u2019s forces lay siege to the castle.\n \n***\n \nHow could this happen? \nIn her seventh life, Rishe wearily sank into her chair. Across from her sat Arnold, his legs crossed and chin propped up on his hand, watching her lazily.\n\u201cWhat\u2019s the matter?\u201d he asked. \u201cYou seem unhappy.\u201d\n\u201cYou could say that.\u201d Even her voice was grumpy. Still, she couldn\u2019t very well tell him it was because she bore a grudge from a previous life. After the first time her life rewound to that pivotal moment, she\u2019d resolved to keep her loops a secret. \u201cI had plans for my exile. A brand-new life. And now because of you, my parents are involved. Even the king has heard about it!\u201d\nAfter Rishe rejected Arnold, Dietrich had immediately cried out, \u201cTh-the crown prince of Galkhein proposed to Rishe?!\u201d\nHis shrieks were loud enough to attract the attention of the master and mistress of the manor.\nWhen her parents came out, Rishe had protested, \u201cI\u2019m not going to marry him! I\u2019m leaving the country just as Dietrich commanded.\u201d\nNo one listened. Their faces just paled with nervous confusion.\nJust then, a glittering coach arrived. Half-stuck in the mud, the man inside it was forced to trudge over the swampy ground, and so the king of Hermity himself arrived, staggering and dirt-stained. \nHe grabbed hold of his son\u2019s collar, pushing him into a low bow. He then turned to Prince Arnold and said, rather loudly, \u201cYour Highness! Allow me to apologize for my son\u2019s foolishness! You are an esteemed guest all the way from Galkhein! It is unthinkable he would not offer you the courtesy you are due!\u201d\n\u201cYou\u2019re hurting me, Father! My back!\u201d\nThe king then turned to Rishe. \u201cMy lady, allow me to sincerely apologize as both a king and a father. My son\u2019s behavior toward you has been utterly disgraceful. I beg you to please give Prince Arnold\u2019s proposal due consideration. Not only for your own sake but for the sake of your country.\u201d\nThe king bowed to her as deeply as his son had to Arnold, and her parents joined him. Rishe felt dizzy at the sight of this abject debasement in the presence of citizens.\nArnold, who had been watching the proceedings with a detached amusement, sobered and stepped toward the king. \u201cYour Majesty, please rise.\u201d\nWithout the smirk, Arnold\u2019s face immediately reverted to its cold mask. The king didn\u2019t move. Maybe something in Arnold\u2019s voice kept him frozen.\n\u201cSuch a trifle won\u2019t cause discord between our kingdoms,\u201d he went on. \u201cHowever, I would beg a little time to speak with Lady Rishe.\u201d\nLater, Rishe would learn that Arnold\u2019s attendant had spoken to the king",

But acquiescence seemed the fastest way to"

Back when I was a maid, my lady would lock herself in her chambers all the time to avoid her studies. I had to break her out just like this.\nThe lock on the coach was simple, and it came open easily. Once she was free, she scanned her surroundings. She didn\u2019t see anyone who looked immediately hostile, but there was noise up ahead. Cautiously, she headed toward it.\nBefore long, she found Arnold.\nWow.\nRoughly ten men\u2014the bandits, she presumed\u2014lay crumpled on the ground. In their midst stood Arnold, in the process of tripping another man into the dirt. He scowled, blade at the man\u2019s throat. \u201cIs that it, then?\u201d\n\u201cGwugh!\u201d\nArnold kicked the bandit in the stomach, eyes blazing with cruelty. \u201cThat\u2019s all the thrill you offer me after I went to the trouble of drawing my sword? Barely worth it. I\u2019m bored already.\u201d\nHe wasn\u2019t angry; on the contrary, he stared his enemies down with chilly disappointment, as if this had all been a letdown. Even Arnold\u2019s own knights seemed terrified of their master when he was in a mood. Arnold smoothly flicked the blood off his sword, wiping the blade on the bandit\u2019s shirt before sheathing it. The rest of the men on the ground seemed to be unconscious.\nWait, he didn\u2019t kill anyone? Why not? Is it because we haven\u2019t reached Galkhein?\nShe supposed even Arnold knew better than to go around killing the citizens of other countries. Or perhaps he had yet to become the ruthless monster she knew him as.\nArnold seemed to sense her gaze, turning around with a start. Genuine emotion bloomed on his face, worlds away from the blank mask he wore to face down the bandits. \u201cHow did you get out of the coach?\u201d\nRishe shrugged. \u201cIf I tell you, you\u2019ll be able to prevent me from doing it again.\u201d\nArnold snickered. \u201cYou continue to amaze me.\u201d\nHow can you go from ice-cold to suddenly looking like a normal nineteen-year-old? It\u2019s disconcerting. \nRishe fought down her disquiet as a man alighted from a coach and shouted, \u201cYour Highness! Not again!\u201d He was Oliver, one of the prince\u2019s attendants. He had silver hair and was roughly as tall as Arnold.\n\u201cWhat do you think all these knights are for, decoration? Why do you insist on endangering yourself?\u201d\nRishe had only met Oliver briefly a few days ago, but he didn\u2019t appear to be intimidated by Arnold at all. And, well\u2026he\u2019s not wrong.\nShe feared the menace would return to Arnold\u2019s expression, but he just looked annoyed. \u201cI could tell they were prepared to kill. I\u2019d prefer to take the burden on myself than risk multiple injuries so far afield. And we already have casualties.\u201d\nHe was right. Several injured knights leaned listlessly among the trees. Arnold issued orders to those still able-bodied. \u201cFirst squad, see to the wounded. Second squad, arrest these men.\u201d\n\u201cYes, sir!\u201d\nOliver appeared unsatisfied. \u201cYour Highness, that is a weak justification. I\u2019m overjoyed you\u2019re well, but you must consider Lady Rishe. Perhaps next time we run into a team of murderous brigands, you could allow your consort to remain in the coach.\u201d\n\u201cI told her to remain in the coach!\u201d\nRishe quickly averted her gaze, turning her attention to the wounded knights. They didn\u2019t appear badly injured, yet they all seemed exhausted.\n\u201cExcuse me, can I take a look?\u201d Rishe approached the knight acting as a medic. He looked round, startled by her presence.\n\u201cNonsense, my lady. Don\u2019t trouble yourself, you must have had quite a scare.\u201d\nThis was not unreasonable, but the wariness in his eyes made it clear he wanted her nowhere near his comrade. He isn\u2019t just being polite. He truly is on guard. \nBeside them, an injured knight groaned as another helped him up. \u201cWhat\u2019s wrong with you?\u201d the second knight asked the first. \n\u201cI-I feel\u2026numb.\u201d\n\u201cWhat? Damn.\u201d The knight grabbed up one of the fallen bandit\u2019s swords, going pale as he inspected the blade. \u201cYour Highness, look at this. Poison.\u201d\nArnold clicked his tongue. \u201cLocate every laceration and bind them close to the heart. Suck the poison from the wounds.\u201d\nHe mostly got that right, at least. In the meantime, Rishe located the nearest bound bandit and pulled his dagger out of its sheath. Its wet coating gleamed in the sunlight, just as the knight had said.\nThey applied the poison liberally\u2014whatever it is must be cheap and easily bought in bulk.\nShe wafted the smell toward her, bracing for something rancid, but detected nothing. Then she brought it closer to her nose.\nIt smells sweet, like an overripe apple. Shea grass and\u2026bluecap mushrooms. All the knights appear to have the same symptoms, so I won\u2019t have to check every blade.\nRishe stood back up and headed for the coach.\nOliver took a step after her. \u201cYour Highness, Lady Rishe is\u2014\u201d\n\u201cLeave her. She may do as she pleases.\u201d\n\u201cShe\u2019s well trained,\u201d Oliver mused. \u201cBut a battlefield is no place for a young lady. She probably wasn\u2019t prepared for such a dreadful spectacle.\u201d\nRishe ignored the murmurs and focused on her work. There they are. I\u2019ll take these, these, and\u2026\n\u201cThe poison must be a sleeping drug,\u201d she overheard Arnold saying. \u201cHunters use such drugs to weaken larger prey. I doubt this dose is lethal.\u201d\n\u201cBut it certainly is annoying,\u201d replied Oliver. \u201cWe\u2019re still two days out from Galkhein. Lugging a company of sleeping men in armor won\u2019t be pleasant.\u201d\n\u201cWe\u2019ll have to stop somewhere nearby. A hunter\u2019s settlement. Perhaps they will have an antidote\u2014\u201d\n\u201cExcuse me.\u201d Rishe, who\u2019d returned from the carriage, raised a hand. \u201cI have an antidote.\u201d\n\u201cWhat?\u201d\nThe entire company stared at her in awe.\n",
    "query_text": " \n***\n \nAs it turned out, Arnold\u2019s guess was right. \nThis sweet-smelling substance was a hunter\u2019s drug, made from ingredients that were only toxic in their raw form. Heat rendered them harmless. Rishe had encountered this poison several times before, curing a customer afflicted with it during her life as an apothecary.\n\u201cA lethal dose for a grown man would fill a wine glass. They likely got less than a hundredth of that,\u201d Rishe explained to Arnold, not looking up from her work. \u201cStill, the numbness can block their airways with the roots of their tongues. It\u2019s best to lay them on their sides.\u201d\n\u201cYes, I"

We need to show them this to forestall any potential moves against you in the future.\n\u201cShow them what, exactly?\u201d\n\u201cThat I\u2019ll protect you no matter what.\u201d\nHe said it with such nonchalance that it brought her up short. Protect me? Arnold Hein, protect me?\nSuch an ironic position to take. She couldn\u2019t tell him that, of course. Her response came out somewhat strangled. \u201cI doubt they\u2019ll be anything to worry about. In fact, the biggest threat facing me is you"

    "prefix_text": ", but she shook her head. \u201cYour job is to guard me, not do my housekeeping.\u201d\n\u201cThis is quite the place to clean on your own, detached though it may be,\u201d the knight said hesitantly. \u201cIt\u2019s not too late to move into the guest chambers instead.\u201d\n\u201cThat\u2019s all right. I like the place already.\u201d\nRishe remained steadfast in her refusal for one reason: readying guest chambers was an awful chore. The palace maids would be expected to work overnight to prepare them, even if the guests were only staying a single night. No speck of dust or strand of hair could remain. Certainly no wrinkled sheets. Rishe knew how exhausting and rigorous a maid\u2019s job was, how nerve-racking.\nShe refused to put the poor dears through such an ordeal for just a few days\u2019 stay. From the sound of things, the palace wasn\u2019t equipped with many housemaids. No doubt they already had their hands full.\n\u201cBesides, take a look.\u201d She held out her arms wide, gesturing to her sparkling clean floor. The knights stared at the bright room in admiration. \u201cCleaning a place with your own hands makes living there that much more satisfying, you see.\u201d\nThe knights smiled their awkward but good-natured agreement.\nRishe worked tirelessly, and before long, the chambers where she would spend the night were ready. The knights offered to carry in the bed, which she allowed.\nWhile they brought in furniture, Rishe started cleaning another room. She had run out of clean water, so she quietly slipped out to the well without informing the knights. It wasn\u2019t quite fair to them, but these were the palace grounds. Surely she didn\u2019t need to be chaperoned everywhere.\nBesides, they\u2019re guards in name only. They\u2019re clearly just here to report my movements to Arnold Hein, Rishe reflected as she walked through a courtyard full of flowers, bucket in hand. Iridescent butterflies cavorted playfully around her feet. He doesn\u2019t seem in a hurry to introduce me to the king. Although if I\u2019m just a hostage, that doesn\u2019t surprise me.\nShe hoped she got to meet the current emperor at least once. The future Arnold\u2019s violent conquest only began after he killed the man and made himself emperor, after all.\nI wonder what happened to Arnold Hein after I died in my past life. Did he reign supreme after winning his war? Or did some country manage to put a stop to his conquest? Whatever the case, I absolutely cannot allow him to start a conflict this time. Being the empress of a wartime nation sounds like so much work! The very thought is unacceptable!\nPerhaps they could divorce, but Rishe had a feeling that if Arnold decided to discard her in the middle of a war, she would fail in her mission to make it past the age of twenty. Better to avoid the situation all together.\nWait. When she thought about it, the cause of every single one of Rishe\u2019s deaths was Arnold and his war. I died fighting. I died when Galkhein\u2019s army invaded\u2026\nLooking at her six lives, all of them had ended in more or less the same way.\nRishe found herself crouched on the ground, cradling her head in her hands. Maybe we should get a divorce right now. But it wasn\u2019t in Rishe\u2019s nature to take back her decisions once she\u2019d made them. \nIf I leave, I\u2019ll probably just die in some war-related disaster again. If I can\u2019t live apart from him, I should take this opportunity to learn everything that I can. \nRishe didn\u2019t know the cause of her repeating lives, but there was no guarantee that the loops were infinite. She had to operate under the possibility that this life could be her last. This required some thought, but standing around seething with anxiety wouldn\u2019t help.\nRight now I\u2019ll focus on cleaning. Once the bath is here, I\u2019ll scrub off all the dust and travel exhaustion. And then I can finally relax! \nBrimming with new determination, she stood up and headed for the well. She was forestalled by the sound of jeering giggles. \n\u201cAww, look at the new girl, trying so hard,\u201d said one voice.\n\u201cAll the enthusiasm in the world won\u2019t make a difference,\u201d said another. \u201cWe\u2019re going to be the crown princess\u2019s maids, not you.\u201d\nThe first added, \u201cHey, are you even listening? Stop wasting your time!\u201d\nRishe heard a weak scream, followed by a thump, like a body hitting the ground. She broke into a run, finding a blonde girl sprawled in the dirt, surrounded by four other women.\n\u201cAre you all right?\u201d Rishe hurried over to help the girl up. Her maid\u2019s uniform\u2014a loose navy-blue dress with a white apron\u2014was smeared with mud. The others were dressed identically.\n\u201cWho are you?\u201d one of the girls snapped at Rishe. She had a mop of blazing-red hair. \u201cAnother newbie?\u201d\nAn understandable mistake. Rishe\u2019s dress was simple, free of ornamentation, and her hair was bound back in a ponytail to keep it out of the way. She was dust-streaked, sweaty, and carrying a bucket in her arms.\nTelling them who I am will be more trouble than it\u2019s worth. Her silence only angered the girls more.\n\u201cAre you one of the crown princess\u2019s maids? They\u2019ve been snatching up every new girl. Those pretty hands of yours don\u2019t look like they\u2019ve ever held a broom,\u201d said one of them.\n\u201cUnfortunately for you, we\u2019ve been working here three years, and we\u2019ll be the ones to serve Prince Arnold as the maids of his palace.\u201d\n\u201cCan you stand? Oh, good, it looks like you\u2019re not injured.\u201d Rishe helped the girl up out of the dirt. \n\u201cHey, don\u2019t ignore us!\u201d the redheaded maid shouted. \u201cYou\u2019ve got some nerve. If you want to make it here, you\u2019ll know your place! I doubt the two of you will last a week!\u201d\nRishe didn\u2019t respond, her attention snagging on something else. The redhead was carrying curtains, probably to bring them to the wash. Rishe stared at them so hard the maid began to shift uncomfortably. \u201cWhat\u2019s your problem?\u201d\n\u201cYou should wait to wash those,\u201d Rishe said.\nThe girl glared daggers at her. \u201cExcuse me? Are you telling me it\u2019s too late in the day? You really are an amateur! The light lasts longer in the spring, you know. And it\u2019s hot today. There\u2019ll be plenty of\u2014\u201d \n\u201cIt\u2019s going to rain, is all.\u201d\nThe maids exchanged glances. \u201cHow can you be so sure?\u201d\n\u201cLook at the clouds amassing. The butterflies and the bees are flying low. The moisture in the air will make the drying take longer.\u201d\n\u201cWhat?\u201d\nAnother maid spoke up in a soft voice. \u201cDiana, you were the one who said we should take the initiative to wash the bigger pieces. You said the crown prince would choose us for his household!\u201d\n\u201cStop putting the blame on me! This isn\u2019t my fault.\u201d An indignant flush crept over the redhead\u2019s face. \u201cThere\u2019s no way some upstart can tell what time it\u2019s going to rain! The weather is going to be fantastic all day. Come on, we\u2019re hauling these over to the wash!\u201d\nThe three girls meekly followed Diana.\nRishe sighed, turning to the blonde girl. \u201cAre you hurt?\u201d\n\u201cNo, I\u2019m fine.\u201d The girl\u2019s gaze darted around nervously. \u201cI\u2019m Elsie. Thank you for helping me.\u201d Her face was studiously blank, but from the way she struggled with her words, Rishe could tell she was being genuine.\n\u201cDon\u2019t worry about it,\u201d Rishe said. \u201cYour uniform seems to have fared less well.\u201d\n\u201cOh no.\u201d Elsie looked down at herself. Her face remained vacant, but she seemed sad. \u201cAnd I just got it.\u201d \n\u201cYou can get the dirt out if you wash it straight away. It\u2019s going to rain, but this dress should dry quickly. Use lots of soap, but don\u2019t scrub it by hand\u2014scrape the mud off with a brush.\u201d\n\u201cWhy a brush?\u201d\n\u201cBecause your fingers will just grind dirt into the threads. A brush is more porous.\u201d\nThe young sons of the family Rishe served spent their time tumbling in the dirt, and she had plenty of experience scraping mud out of clothes. She could even salvage dirty socks that had spent days crumpled in the corner.\n\u201cDo you\u2026 Are you\u2026\u201d Elsie trailed off, blinking rapidly a couple of times before finally looking Rishe in the eyes. \u201cAre you the crown princess\u2019s maid?\u201d\nUnsure how to answer, Rishe couldn\u2019t meet her eyes.\n \n***\n \nAfter parting ways with Elsie, Rishe returned to the detached wing with her fresh water. She put clean sheets on the bed the knights had installed, satisfied that she had a comfortable place to sleep. This room also had the highest-up balcony in the whole detached palace.\nTaking a break, she wandered out onto the balcony and looked off over the capital, the golden afternoon tinged with the onset of twilight. The day was fresh with a recent rain, the air clear enough to see for miles. The spring breeze felt good against her skin, sweaty from cleaning. Rishe leaned against the railing, leaning her head back and closing her eyes.\nShe felt like collapsing into bed immediately, but she desperately needed a wash. Still, she didn\u2019t want to pull herself away from the view and the breeze just yet. When she resumed gazing out absentmindedly, something her mother once said drifted back to her. \n\u201cRishe, there is no need for you to think for yourself.\u201d\nShe frowned, the memories coming thick and fast now.\n\u201cYou mustn\u2019t forget that the duty of our family is to live our lives fully devoted to the kings of the land. You\u2019re smart, but all the thinking in the world won\u2019t do a woman any good. You need only concern yourself with how best to serve the crown prince.\u201d\n\u201cStudies? Focus on social etiquette\u2014that\u2019s what you need for navigating high society. The crown prince\u2019s bride must be flawless. Your smile is lacking. You must always strive to appear amiable.\u201d\nRishe breathed out a long sigh. When I was fifteen, their lectures were the only thing I thought about.\nHer parents preached constantly. \u201cA woman\u2019s true happiness is to marry a suitable man and give birth to his heirs.\u201d\n\u201cBut, Mother\u2026\u201d\nObjection was not permitted. Any argument was immediately dispensed with. As a woman, Rishe could not inherit her father\u2019s title. Her only value was in her marriage. \nDespite knowing now that the opinions of others were as worthless as empty titles, the words still echoed in her memories.\nRishe\u2019s fingertips twitched, and she opened her eyes. Unmoving, she said, \u201cShouldn\u2019t you be seeing to your duties?\u201d\n\u201cMore hidden depths, I see,\u201d came a voice tinged with pleasure. Rishe straightened and turned. There was Arnold, leaning against the door to the balcony. \u201cYou seem able to sense my approach no matter how far or how hard I try.\u201d\n\u201cYou\u2019re quite naughty, aren\u2019t you? You\u2019ve been making your presence known little by little, emanating threat, to see how quickly I catch on.\u201d\n\u201cSo you noticed that as well.\u201d Arnold joined Rishe on the balcony. She tensed, but all he did was cast a curious glance at the view. \u201cWhat were you looking at?\u201d\n\u201cThe city.\u201d Rishe was hardly going to tell him she\u2019d been looking at nothing, merely ruminating on her mother\u2019s overbearing advice. The view from the balcony was spectacular, though. \u201cWhat\u2019s that over there?\u201d\n\u201cYou mean the library? The state invested funds to expand it. We have books from all over the world.\u201d\n\u201cReally? You have a library that big?\u201d Rishe\u2019s eyes sparkled with delight. She pointed out another building. \u201cWhat about that spire? It\u2019s beautiful.\u201d\n\u201cThe church and clock tower. The bells ring out the hour.\u201d\n\u201cOoh, how wonderful! And it looks like there\u2019s a rather big market there too?\u201d\n\u201cYes, the largest market in the city. Carts line up in the early morning. Most of the offerings are made fresh every day.\u201d\n\u201cAmazing! And what about that pretty mountain over there?\u201d\nRishe tried and failed to contain her excitement. She couldn\u2019t help but imagine what seeing all these places up close would be like. The grand library, the beautiful church that told the time, and the morning market with fresh, delicious food\u2014she wanted to experience it all.\nSeeing Arnold\u2019s bemused face, she said, \u201cWhat?\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m just wondering where all this interest is coming from,\u201d he said. \u201cYou were so reluctant to come, yet here you are, brimming with curiosity for my city.\u201d\n\u201cWell\u2026\u201d she trailed off, unsure of how to respond.\nWhat should I say? Should I just tell him the truth?\nThis wasn\u2019t a secret, but talking about her hopes and dreams to the man who had killed her was a little awkward. A strange self-consciousness settled on her, her cheeks heating as she mumbled, \u201cBecause I\u2019ve always wanted to.\u201d\nArnold looked at her keenly. \u201cWanted to what?\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019ve always wanted to come here.\u201d\nDuring her life as a merchant, Rishe developed her single dream to visit everywhere in the world. That dream was cut tragically short when only one country remained: Galkhein.\nIn each of her consecutive lives, Rishe\u2019s priority became staying alive. Every time, without fail, just as she found her footing, the world was plunged into chaos. She never had the chance to see Galkhein. This betrothal was her chance. \u201cIt\u2019s probably why I agreed to marry you,\u201d she added after a moment\u2019s hesitation.\nArnold swept a tepid glance over the city. \u201cThere\u2019s nothing here worth seeing.\u201d\n\u201cThat\u2019s not true! The places you just told me about sound amazing! Your citizens are clean and happy, your knights are proper and kind. Oh, and another\u2014\u201d \nRishe broke off enumerating Galkhein\u2019s charms as Arnold turned to look at her. His face was impassively calm, but something seemed to pass by underneath, like a shadow in deep water.\n\u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d Rishe said. \u201cDid I say something odd?\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m just amazed you could be so unaware of yourself.\u201d \nWh-what a rude thing to\u2014\n\u201cI\u2019ve never met anyone like you. No one has ever spoken to me the way you do. I don\u2019t know any girls of your class with the knowledge or the physical abilities you possess. Noblewomen don\u2019t concern themselves with such things.\u201d\nRishe, there is no need for you to think for yourself.\nShe frowned. \u201cPerhaps you\u2019re right, but everything I\u2019ve learned is precious to me. No one can take my skills away\u2014I value them with my life. Some may say that my knowledge is worthless, but it makes no difference to me.\u201d She turned from the balcony, fixing him with a piercing gaze. \u201cI\u2019m the one who decides what I value.\u201d\nRishe had clawed free of her mother and father\u2019s indoctrination a long time ago. Man, woman\u2014it didn\u2019t matter. She could do anything. Being queen was not the culmination of her life; she wouldn\u2019t trade her freedom for anything.\nArnold matched her intensity. \u201cYou\u2019re right.\u201d He gently cupped her cheek in a one hand, swiping his thumb along the line of her jaw, smearing dust. \u201cLive your life here however you wish. I vow to do my utmost to protect you.\u201d\n\u201cHuh?\u201d\nHis vehemence took her by surprise. Arnold had every right to demand she act the part of a proper consort. This was a political marriage; Rishe was essentially a hostage, after all. Yet here he was, cosigning her misbehavior. Moreover, he was all but swearing to defend her from the consequences.\n\u201cWhy?\u201d\n\u201cYou know why. I\u2019m enamored with you.\u201d Arnold fed her the same line. \u201cI know you said you don\u2019t care about other people\u2019s approval, but I like your asymmetrical talents. I don\u2019t find them useless at all.\u201d \nRishe didn\u2019t know how to respond.\n\u201cI thought I\u2019d already made that clear.\u201d He took his hand back, drawing away, stopping just on the threshold. He turned back to a stunned Rishe and said, \u201cLet me know if there\u2019s anything you desire. I realize I just broke our agreement\u2014the one about not touching you.\u201d\nAnd with that, he was gone.\nShaken, Rishe sank to the floor of the balcony. I can\u2019t predict him at all! Just what is Arnold Hein planning?\nThe quiet of evening fell over the imperial capital of Galkhein.\n \n***\n \n\u201cMmm.\u201d\nSunshine streamed through the window as Rishe roused from sleep. She rolled over, basking in the morning light. The wall she expected wasn\u2019t there, and the bed seemed larger than usual. Taking advantage of it, she stretched out as far as she could.\nWas this her chamber at home? Or maybe she was a merchant again, spending a night at the desert king\u2019s palace. Perhaps this was her bed of straw from her life as a maid? Her memories met and interwove as she drifted into wakefulness.\nWhen Rishe finally opened her eyes, she grew even more confused.\nLight blue curtains surrounded the bed, thin enough to allow sunlight to pass through. She pulled them aside to find herself in a bare room devoid of furniture and carpet.\nOh, right. She didn\u2019t need to report for morning training, tend to her herb garden, prepare breakfast, or see how the bottles she had brewed overnight were coming along.\nRealizing that, Rishe buried her face in the pillow. \u201cSo soft,\u201d she murmured. \nJudging by the position of the sun, it was about six o\u2019clock in the morning. She was pretty sure she had gone to bed around midnight last night.\nI slept for six whole hours? Rishe couldn\u2019t believe it. Generally, she was used to getting about four hours of sleep. On bad days, at the height of an emergency as a knight or apothecary, she wouldn\u2019t even get that much. \nI\u2019ve got nothing but cleaning on the schedule today. Hostages can sleep in, right? At least a little? Excitement suffused her at the thought, but that was interrupted by a knock on the door.\n\u201cLady Rishe, are you awake? It\u2019s Oliver\u2014Prince Arnold\u2019s attendant.\u201d\nRishe sat up with a start. \u201cI\u2019m awake!\u201d\nOliver continued to speak through the door. \u201cI apologize for bothering you at such an early hour. I\u2019m here with a delivery.\u201d\n\u201cJust a moment!\u201d Rishe slipped out of the",

She opened the door to find Oliver standing in the hallway with a polite smile.\nHe apologized again. \u201cThis was the only time I could slip away from His Highness\u2019s office. I\u2019m glad to see that you\u2019re already dressed.\u201d\n\u201cNot at all.\u201d Rishe paused, stepping back to allow him inside. \u201cOh my. You look exhausted.\u201d\nOliver grimaced. \u201cIs it"

    "prefix_text": " the war, there must have been a trigger\u2014a sea change in the affairs of state. Everyone on this list was most likely involved.\nKing Zahad. I hope we can be friends again like in my first life. Hmm\u2026 Prince Kyle is rather frail. I hope he isn\u2019t working himself too hard. He has a strong sense of responsibility\u2014he\u2019ll attend the wedding even though it\u2019ll be a long trip.\nThe sight of these names filled Rishe with a longing for those lives, for the people she\u2019d once known. And sometime in the very near future, they would all be Galkhein\u2019s enemies.\nIf I take matters into my own hands, perhaps I can salvage some of these relationships before they sour. Even if we aren\u2019t allies, we don\u2019t have to be enemies. Anything to stave off the outbreak of war.\nOliver had no idea what was going through Rishe\u2019s head. Brightly, he continued their conversation. \u201cThe ceremony will be held in three months\u2019 time. All preparations must be complete by then. And now\u2026we need to discuss tonight\u2019s party.\u201d\n\u201cTonight\u2019s what?\u201d\nOliver stiffened. \u201cDid His Highness not tell you?\u201d\n\u201cNo, he most certainly did not! There\u2019s to be a party?\u201d\n\u201cUgh, not again!\u201d Oliver dug his knuckles into his forehead.\nRishe put two and two together. She hesitated, then said, \u201cSo there is one, then. As you must know, His Highness is trying to stamp it down without telling me.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d Oliver replied. \u201cHe should have mentioned it to you. You don\u2019t need to attend, but he will. At least, I hope he will. I think I managed to convince him.\u201d\nShe sympathized with Oliver. Under normal circumstances, it would be unheard of for the crown prince and his fianc\u00e9e to fail to appear at a banquet. \u201cDon\u2019t worry, Oliver. I\u2019ll go.\u201d\nOliver let out a sigh of relief. \u201cReally? Thank you so much, my lady. I\u2019ll put finding you a maid at the top of my to-do list.\u201d\n\u201cNo need.\u201d Rishe smiled. \u201cI can prepare for the party on my own.\u201d\nThis maid-selection process made Rishe uneasy. After witnessing that exchange between the servants in the garden, she imagined quarrels breaking out all through the palace. And she doubted the disputes would go away even after they decided.\nOliver frowned. \u201cBut won\u2019t dressing be difficult without a lady\u2019s maid?\u201d \nShe shook her head. \u201cI can do my hair and put on a gown by myself. I brought dresses and cosmetics from home. Don\u2019t worry.\u201d\nRishe ignored Oliver\u2019s stunned look, already reevaluating her cleaning plans.\n \n***\n \nThe first thing Rishe said to Arnold that night was, \u201cYour Highness, I have a request.\u201d Her gown rustled as she leaned in close. \u201cI would like some herb seed and a corner of the gardens. I made a list. I hope we can discuss this in more detail later.\u201d\nArnold was silent a moment. \u201cRishe.\u201d\n\u201cWhat? Didn\u2019t you tell me to let you know if there was anything I wanted?\u201d She looked at him quizzically, and Arnold sighed.\nShe\u2019d heard that he\u2019d finished his mountain of work and even managed to sleep for a while. He was dressed in his usual military black, trimmed with a red mantle and black gloves.\nArnold shook his head. \u201cThat\u2019s not what I mean. I\u2019m guessing that Oliver didn\u2019t tell you the reason for this party? It\u2019s merely for appearance\u2019s sake. I need to look like I\u2019m searching for a bride within our borders as well. There\u2019s no reason for you to attend.\u201d\nIt made sense. The crown prince\u2014the greatest catch in the kingdom\u2014marrying a foreigner without even the slightest nod to propriety would invite unwanted discontent from the nobility.\n\u201cHowever, we\u2019re betrothed,\u201d Arnold said. \u201cThis whole evening is merely a formality. And with news that you\u2019re my \u2018hostage\u2019 going around, you\u2019ll be an object of curiosity. I don\u2019t want to put you through that.\u201d\n\u201cWell, I already went to the trouble of getting ready.\u201d Rishe plucked at her soft blue dress, draped in fluttering layers around her like a flower bud. She\u2019d braided her hair, decorating it with accessories. Her makeup was light, her shoes polished to a mirror shine. Her only jewelry was a pair of pearl earrings.\n\u201cRishe\u2026\u201d\n\u201cYour Highness, the court may consider my status as a captive princess shameful in the extreme, but I don\u2019t.\u201d She\u2019d chosen this course, after all.\nArnold was again watching her with a mixture of wonder and confusion.\n\u201cSo don\u2019t worry,\u201d she said, extending her hand. \u201cFeel free to show off your fianc\u00e9e.\u201d\nArnold relented, his dashing smile creeping out once again. \u201cVery well. I should take advantage of this opportunity to touch my betrothed.\u201d\n\u201cWe\u2019re wearing gloves.\u201d\nArnold took Rishe\u2019s hand.\nA throng of guests was gathered in the ballroom as a group of musicians performed on a platform. Women in gowns stood clustered, while gentlemen in military attire grouped together. A mere glance was enough to tell their clothes were of the highest quality. They mingled happily, making small talk with glasses in hand.\nRishe let her hand rest on Arnold\u2019s arm as she paused at the threshold to take it all in. \u201cThis is a bigger event than I was expecting.\u201d\n\u201cIs it? I\u2019d say it\u2019s a rather small gathering, actually.\u201d\n\u201cMaybe for a military powerhouse,\u201d Rishe muttered. \nYet another reminder of Galkhein\u2019s wealth took her off guard. Arnold just looked bored.\n\u201cThe size doesn\u2019t matter,\u201d he said. \u201cIn the end, they\u2019re only here for gossip. Look, here they come.\u201d\nIn the blink of an eye, they were surrounded by guests.\n\u201cPrince Arnold, thank you for gracing us with an invitation,\u201d said one man. \u201cSuch a pleasure.\u201d \n\u201cThe pleasure is mine, Lord Abel,\u201d Arnold drawled.\n\u201cYour Highness! We were so glad to hear of your safe return,\u201d another guest chirped. \u201cPlease, our daughter is simply dying to be regaled with tales of your trip.\u201d\n\u201cI can\u2019t imagine I\u2019d have anything particularly exciting to share with her,\u201d Arnold said curtly.\nAfter the last few days, Rishe found this look of glazed apathy disturbing. His good looks only compounded it\u2014he was so handsome that every expression was stark.\nHe looks more like Emperor Arnold Hein now, but still not the same.\nArnold appeared to notice her watching him. When he looked at her, his sourness disappeared, replaced by a genuine smile. All around him, women found themselves flushing. Arnold paid no heed to their fervent gazes, instead leaning in to give Rishe a brief moment of consideration.\nThen he leaned in close enough to kiss her.\n\u201cA dull trip,\u201d he said again, pulling away. \u201cBut fortuitous. Without it, I would have never met the woman destined to be my wife.\u201d\nA shocked murmur rolled through the crowd. Rishe, who hadn\u2019t recovered from seeing Arnold\u2019s beautiful face at close range, barely noticed the looks of utter loathing the assembled women were throwing her.\n\u201cH-His Highness is smiling? At his hostage bride?\u201d\n\u201cHe called her his wife?! He\u2019s never even looked at us!\u201d\nThey were whispers, but they carried.\nA portly man stepped forward with his daughter in tow. \u201cYour Highness, do you mean to say that this lovely young woman is your fianc\u00e9e?\u201d\nEvery eye in the ballroom was on Rishe, alight with curiosity, envy, or schemes. None of them could hide their contempt. But Rishe didn\u2019t falter.\nThis is nothing compared to being publicly dumped in a banquet hall. And I\u2019ve done that seven times!\nShe offered a polite smile and an astoundingly correct curtsy. Left leg at a diagonal behind the right, back straight, head bowed. \u201cHow do you do? My name is Rishe Irmgard Weitzner.\u201d\nEven the most hostile guests could find nothing impolite in her greeting, no sign of rough manners from the rustic daughter of a backwater nation. Rishe had years of training in expectation of ascending to the throne. Occasionally, habits from her other lives slipped through, but Arnold appeared to be the only one who noticed.\nNow he was looking",

I hope I can count on you all to hold me accountable should I prove an incompetent husband.\u201d\n\u201cB-but of course, Your Highness.\u201d\n\u201cCome, Rishe.\u201d Arnold guided her out of the ring of spectators. The stares continued to follow them as they walked away.\nRishe dropped her voice to a whisper. \u201cYou sure know how to invite the ire of women.\u201d\n\u201cWhatever do you mean?\u201d\n\u201cThe way you harped on about me. Everything you said was tailor-made to stoke their jealousy. You\u2019ve gained me enemies, so thanks for that.\u201d\nArnold snorted. \u201cEverything I said was to protect you from enemies. They need to know you aren\u2019t just some trophy they can eliminate without recourse. We need to show them this to forestall any potential moves against you in the future.\n\u201cShow them what, exactly?\u201d\n"

I\u2019ll have them executed.\u201d\n\u201cDon\u2019t be ridiculous. You don\u2019t kill people like her\u2014you use them.\u201d Just the tiniest bit of wine to go, but it was getting harder to make herself drink it. She gave the glass a reproachful look, then glanced back at Arnold. \u201cOh, and I owe you an apology.\u201d\n\u201cDo you?\u201d\n\u201cI used your name to defend myself.\u201d The girls had only backed off when she threatened to tattle to Arnold. Rishe found that sort of thing inelegant in the extreme, and she was embarrassed.\nArnold sighed at Rishe\u2019s apologetic bow. \u201cThere\u2019s nothing wrong with a wife invoking her husband\u2019s name.\u201d\nRishe hesitated. \u201cWe\u2019re not married yet.\u201d\n\u201cThat\u2019s a formality. It\u2019s as good as done, if you ask me.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2026see.\u201d\nHe took her distraction as an opportunity to swipe her glass back. Instead of dumping it out, Arnold gulped the rest of it down. \n\u201cDamn, that packs a punch,\u201d he grumbled.\n\u201cI told you that!\u201d Rishe snapped. \u201cAre you all right? Let me get you some water!\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m fine. But now you\u2019ve fulfilled your obligation to the wine, haven\u2019t you?\u201d\nRishe didn\u2019t know what to say. He\u2019d helped her\u2014not by taking charge but by following her lead. Without cutting her down and telling her she was being foolish. Without rolling his eyes and dismissing her desires as trifles.\n\u201cThank you,\u201d Rishe said stiffly, which just made him laugh.\n\u201cWhat were you thinking about when we were dancing?\u201d he asked.\n\u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d\n\u201cYou were thinking about someone else, weren\u2019t you? Who?\u201d\nRishe didn\u2019t know a delicate way to say I was thinking about a future version of you I met in another life.\n\u201cHmm?\u201d His tone was oddly light, teasing even. But the gleam in his hunter\u2019s eyes said she wouldn\u2019t get away so easily.\nObviously, Rishe couldn\u2019t give him an honest answer. \u201cI wasn\u2019t thinking about anyone else. I was worried about you.\u201d\n\u201cWhy?\u201d\nThis was the closest she could come to the truth. \u201cWere you injured here?\u201d She patted her own left shoulder with her forefinger. \nArnold went silent. His left shoulder was slightly slower to react than his right\u2014if his right was at one hundred, then his left was at maybe ninety-eight. It was hardly noticeable, but Rishe had picked up on it. He was right-handed, and she wouldn\u2019t have noticed it if they\u2019d been dancing normally. \nThat, and if it hadn\u2019t been for memories from her past life.\nRishe had only managed to inflict a single injury on him. An instant, a moment\u2019s hesitation where she saw her chance and slashed left. Of course, he\u2019d shrugged off the injury and effortlessly run her through. \n\u201cHeh.\u201d Arnold finally broke his silence with grim laughter. His eyes sent shivers down her spine, cold and bewitching. In lieu of an answer, he reached for his collar, unfastening the clasp with a snap and drawing his jacket open with a rough tug.\nOh my.\nRishe drew in a breath. A great scar was engraved into the nape of his neck, just low enough to be concealed by clothing. It looked several years old. \u201cIt\u2019s an old wound. It continues to the top of my shoulder and pulls the skin taut.\u201d\n\u201cHow awful.\u201d Rishe couldn\u2019t help but reach out to gingerly touch the nape of his neck.\nArnold accepted her touch without a word. She\u2019d half expected to be slapped aside.\nHer fingers slowly traced the shape of it. She could feel the rough skin through her gloves.\nHe must have gotten this over a decade ago. Someone stabbed him\u2014and not just once or twice. They must have done it over and over to make this scar pattern.\nHer medical training had her shuddering at the image of a nine-year-old Arnold ashen and trembling with blood loss. The fact that he\u2019d survived and retained the use of his arm was incredible. And then to go on to wield a sword so skillfully\u2014his suffering must have been immense.\n\u201cOnly a few people know about this injury. You\u2019re the first to notice on your own.\u201d\n\u201cHow did it happen?\u201d\nThat grim smile returned as he looked down at Rishe. With the moon hanging behind him, he was as opaque as ever, but Rishe understood the sentiment.\nI shouldn\u2019t pry.\nRishe pulled her hand away, and that ominous smile that sent chills down her spine disappeared. Arnold put his jacket back in order, reclasping it at the neck.\nSomeone tried to kill Arnold Hein about ten years ago. But who and why? Rishe cast her eyes down as she ruminated. The most obvious beneficiaries of a dead crown prince would be potential heirs and those loyal to them. I believe Arnold has a younger brother, but I haven\u2019t met him yet.\nOdd. Rishe might be a hostage, but shouldn\u2019t she meet her future relatives? Perhaps it was Arnold\u2019s doing and not the will of the imperial family themselves. He didn\u2019t seem to want to involve her in anything unless it was absolutely necessary\u2014he hadn\u2019t told her about this ball, after all. \nRishe looked up at him. \u201cYour Highness, may I select my maids some time over the next few days?\u201d \n\u201cVery well. I\u2019ll tell Oliver to make that a priority.\u201d\n\u201cAh, I can do the selection myself. We needn\u2019t trouble him.\u201d\nArnold arched an amused brow. Gone was that unsettling smile, replaced with his easy manner. \u201cWhat are you planning this time?\u201d\n\u201cOh, nothing important,\u201d Rishe said. She picked up her empty glass. \u201cI\u2019m merely concerned about the servants\u2019 working conditions.\u201d\nTo protect her life and well-being, she needed to keep from dying at twenty years old again. And to do that, she had to prevent Arnold Hein\u2019s war. Her best bet would be to appeal to the important people she\u2019d known in her past lives. People with influence.\nPlus, there was a mountain of things she needed to do in preparation for the marriage ceremony.\nI need to sow a plot of land, grow herbs, do lots of shopping, get cheap alcohol, and then\u2026 \nRishe began a to-do list that had nothing to do with war in the least.\n \n***\n \nAs the ball wound to a close, a lone boy stood in the gloomy courtyard of the imperial palace. He had soft black hair and round blue eyes. No older than sixteen, he had an androgynous grace to him, gaze fixed on the balcony above. \nHe was watching a girl.\nShe had coral-colored hair, and even from this distance, he could tell she was beautiful. She stood there alone, apparently waiting for someone. Whoever it was must have shown up because her hand slipped from the banister, and she stepped away. Not too long after, a man appeared where she had been standing.\nThe man turned a silent glare down into the garden, as if he\u2019d known the boy had been there the whole time, despite the shadows.\nA shiver ran down the boy\u2019s spine and he smiled reflexively, delighting in the intense aura of threat the man gave off. It was just a warning, it seemed, as the man abruptly turned on his heel and disappeared. \n\u201cAww, we can\u2019t play together either?\u201d The boy hung his head. \u201cI miss you, Brother.\u201d\nIt had to be the woman. The beauty. She\u2019d made the boy\u2019s life hell since the day she arrived. \nHis brother had prohibited him from attending balls like this one. That was fine; he\u2019d sooner avoid them altogether. Still, he\u2019d wanted to meet that girl. \n\u201cBut we\u2019ll meet soon enough, won\u2019t we?\u201d He spoke to himself in a soft voice. \u201cI\u2019ve got plans for you, Sister.\u201d \n\n(2) chapter number given is likely out of range: 0\nChapter: 8\n\nChapter 3\nChapter 3\n \n\u201cYOU\u2019RE ALL SO USELESS!\u201d Diana the redheaded maid\u2019s voice rang out inside the stone washhouse. \nThree days had passed since the afternoon Rishe shook off her guard and came out to the well. Rishe was once again dressed to fit in with the maids. At Diana\u2019s shout, she looked up without pausing in her work. \n\u201cIs even laundry beyond your capabilities? I asked you to wash these this morning, and now it\u2019s past noon! Meanwhile, we\u2019ve finished cleaning the entire first floor in a third of the time!\u201d\n\u201cI-I\u2019m sorry, Diana.\u201d\nThe new maids went silent with shame. Among them was Elsie, the girl Rishe stood up for the other day. Rishe pulled her hands out of the soapy water, gently rinsed them, and said, \u201cLet me help. What still needs to be done?\u201d\n\u201cYou again?\u201d Diana rounded on Rishe. \u201cI don\u2019t know who you serve, but I\u2019m amazed you have the time to do other people\u2019s work. I wish I had so much free time.\u201d\nHuffily, she turned from Rishe. \u201cLet\u2019s just ignore these useless fools. Laura, Maya. Come on. If we want to be chosen as Lady Rishe\u2019s maids, we mustn\u2019t waste our time.\u201d\nDiana took out a slip of paper from her pocket, smoothing it out. \u201cIt looks like the new bedsheets for her palace will arrive today. We should inspect them to make sure everything is perfect!\u201d\n\u201cWait up, Diana!\u201d\nThe two maids followed Diana out. Rishe waited for the door to close before turning to Elsie and the others. \u201cLet\u2019s keep working. If there\u2019s anything too large and cumbersome, feel free to pass it over to me.\u201d\n\u201cTh-thank you so much!\u201d The new maids went weak with gratitude. One of them, a girl on the verge of tears, even fell into a full bow. Rishe muttered encouragement as she scrubbed some bedsheets.\nElsie, who was washing the sheets with her, wore a rueful look. \u201cI\u2019m so sorry for the trouble. We\u2019re just not learning fast enough.\u201d\n\u201cYou haven\u2019t been working here long, have you? It takes time to learn a new job, no matter who you are,\u201d Rishe said as she kept scrubbing. \u201cAnd it\u2019s not like you\u2019ve never washed a single thing in your life before, right?\u201d\nElsie nodded nervously. \nRishe had realized over the past few days doing the laundry that not all the newcomers were complete amateurs. They\u2019d obviously done chores at home, or something similar. When set a specific task, they could perform it properly, but Diana\u2019s complaints weren\u2019t unfounded. They did take far too much time with laundry.\nBut it\u2019s obvious why. \u201cDo you know anything about Diana?\u201d Rishe asked Elsie. \u201cLike, is she from a well-off family?\u201d\nElsie said, \u201cI heard that her father was a business owner. She worked with him.\u201d\n\u201cI heard that as well,\u201d added another maid. \u201cBut he fell into debt and had to sell off.\u201d \nRishe stopped scrubbing for a moment to consider this.\n\u201cUm, is something the matter?\u201d Elsie asked.\nRishe smiled and shook her head. \u201cNo, nothing. Let\u2019s just focus on getting these washed for the time being.\u201d\n \n***\n \nThat afternoon, thirty maids were assembled in the detached wing of the palace. Ten of them were old hands, long in service to the royal family, while the other twenty were freshly hired. The crown princess was to choose her maids from among these thirty. They wore their nerves plainly on their sleeves. \n\u201cHey, I thought this palace was in a terrible state of neglect,\u201d one maid whispered. \u201cWhy is it so sparkling clean?\u201d\n\u201cYeah, you\u2019re right,\u201d said another. \u201cSomeone must have sorted it out before we arrived.\u201d\n\u201cI wonder what kind of person Lady Rishe is. Ooh, I\u2019m so nervous.\u201d\nThe girls looked around anxiously.\n\u201cHey, Elsie, that girl who was always helping us isn\u2019t here.\u201d\nElsie blinked. \u201cYou\u2019re right.\u201d\n\u201cLook, Diana. That impertinent newbie didn\u2019t get picked.\u201d \nAt her friend\u2019s observation, Diana preened with satisfaction. \u201cNo surprise there. You need some manners to attend to Lady Rishe. I bet she got kicked out of the running!\u201d Her eyes sparkled with confidence.\nAt last, there was a knock at the door.\n\u201cHer Royal Highness, Princess Rishe.\u201d\nThe maids quickly fell into bows. Diana\u2019s chest ached with anticipation as heels clicked on the floor, approaching the line of girls. From the corner of their eyes, the maids saw a wide-skirted court dress. A gentle scent washed over them.\nWithout even looking at her, they could tell Crown Princess Rishe was a lovely woman. Diana and her friends swelled with pride that she was to become their mistress.\nBut then Laura whispered to Diana, \u201cHey, isn\u2019t this scent familiar?\u201d\n\u201cQuiet!\u201d Clearly it was some sort of expensive perfume. Or so Diana thought, but then she realized what it was. The words just slipped out. \u201cIt\u2019s soap.\u201d\n\u201cHuh? Did you just say something?\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s soap. The same kind we always use.\u201d Diana was sure of it.\nThe princess said, \u201cPlease rise.\u201d \nWhy did her voice sound so familiar? An incredible foreboding gripping her, Diana looked up. She gasped.\n\u201cMy name is Rishe Irmgard Weitzner.\u201d\nBefore her stood the beautiful newcomer\u2014the thorn in her side for the past few days. The smile she wore was peaceful and just the slightest bit satisfied.\n \n***\n \nI\u2019m so glad I managed to finish washing the sheets in time!\nStanding before the maids with Arnold\u2019s attendant Oliver at her side, Rishe was panicking on the inside. She\u2019d had so much to do this morning that she\u2019d put off the laundry to the last minute. She took deep, controlled breaths, praying no one would notice that she\u2019d raced here at a dead sprint.\nOliver was none the wiser as he spoke to the assembled girls. Rishe took the opportunity to look them over. She locked eyes with Elsie, who was gaping at her. It was a nice change\u2014usually her face was as blank as a rock wall.\nI\u2019m sorry for the deception. I figured blending in would give me the best picture of your working conditions.\nThe new maids wore similarly shocked expressions, while others watched her with delight. Meanwhile, the veterans, including Diana, had all gone pale. They trembled, stunned into silence. One seemed locked in a terrifying trance, while another looked on the verge of tears. All of them had spoken to Rishe with derision. As the ringleader, Diana was covering her mouth with both hands, like she was holding in a scream.\nOliver had finished his introduction. \u201cYour Highness, if you would?\u201d\nRishe stepped forward. \u201cFirst, I must apologize to you for what has transpired prior to this meeting. My deception, that is. However, it has granted me insight into how each one of you works.\u201d\nOliver\u2019s face creased in confusion. The newcomer maids began to panic, whispering among themselves.\n\u201cDoesn\u2019t this mean that she helped us out with the laundry?\u201d\n\u201cWe\u2019re going to be fired!\u201d\n\u201cIf I lose my position, my brother will have to quit school!\u201d\nNoticing the commotion, Oliver glanced at Rishe. \u201cYour Highness, two-thirds of these maids are newly recruited from the city. Since the majority of the castle maids were elderly, His Highness assumed you would prefer maids closer in age to yourself.\u201d\nRishe was startled. She had found it odd that most of her potential servants were new hires, but she hadn\u2019t expected this to be the reason.\n\u201cWhile the prince has entrusted the selection of your maids to you,\u201d Oliver went on. \u201cHiring someone with no experience will not do. Despite Prince Arnold\u2019s views, I urge you to reject the newcomers.\u201d\n\u201cOliver.\u201d\n\u201cI have a list of their names here. Elsie\u2014\u201d\n\u201cElsie, Nichole, Hilde, Marguerite, Rosa.\u201d Rishe began listing the names of the newly recruited maids. She\u2019d made a point to memorize them in the washhouse. \u201cElke, Amelia, and\u2014\u201d\nOliver looked at her wildly. \u201cYou know them all?! Even though they\u2019ve never served you in the past?\u201d\n\u201cYes, of course I do. Servants are essential to the maintenance of our lifestyle, why wouldn\u2019t I get to know them?\u201d Rishe listed the remaining names for good measure. \u201cAll twenty of you, listen to me.\u201d \nThe new maids stiffened. Diana and the other maids whose names hadn\u2019t been called were getting their wind back, wearing increasingly triumphant looks.\nRishe said, \u201cThe twenty names I just called will be my maids.\u201d\nTime seemed to stand still a moment, and then Oliver broke in with an astonished, \u201cB-but, my lady! They are all inexperienced\u2014\u201d\n\u201cYes. And my palace will be the perfect place to learn.\u201d\nThe new recruits were completely speechless, unsure of exactly what was happening. \nRishe smiled at Elsie. \u201cI hope you\u2019ll serve me well, Elsie.\u201d\nElsie was still frozen in place. \u201cHuh? Y-yes, my lady, but\u2014\u201d\nA shaking",
    "query_text": " Diana cried out, \u201cBut why, my lady?! You\u2019ve seen their work! They\u2019re useless, the lot of them! The rest of us get so much more done in a shorter amount of time!\u201d\n\u201cWatch your tongue, girl,\u201d Oliver said sharply.\nDiana ignored him. \u201cWe\u2019re hard workers! Any job you assign us, we can do it! Please, I beg you, my lady!\u201d\n\u201cStep back,\u201d Oliver warned. \u201cDo not take a single step closer to Lady Rishe.\u201d\nDiana spoke in a rush, words pouring out of her. \u201cI-I freely admit that I was impolite before, but I didn\u2019t know who she was! I\u2019ll take any punishment, so please, give me the chance to show"

I must hurry and retrieve my things before I\u2019m barred from the family estate. I don\u2019t want this to be one of the times I\u2019m too slow and I have to start my new life with nothing.\n\u201cRishe, halt and hear me! I have spent the past week perfecting my recitation of your crimes!\u201d\nI should take more than dresses this time\u2014there\u2019s plenty of things I could use out in the world. What trade should I take up? In my first life, I was a merchant. In my second, an apothecary. I\u2019ve got a few more I want to try out\u2026 Augh! If time\u2019s just going to keep resetting, I wish I could start at an earlier point. I need more time to prepare!\n\u201cWait! Rishe!\u201d\nThe crown prince was on the verge of tears, and the spectators struggled to suppress their snickers. \nA thought occurred to Rishe, and she stopped. She then turned, her eyes gleaming beneath long lashes as she stared down her ex-fianc\u00e9. \u201cAh, Your Highness, I almost forgot.\u201d \n\u201cYes, tell me!\u201d the prince fumed. \u201cLet me guess, you are hurt beyond measure and yet love me still\u2026correct?\u201d\nAs if. Rishe was grateful to be granted her freedom. In fact, she was smiling as she said, \u201cI hope you and Lady Mary are happy together.\u201d\n\u201cWhat?!\u201d\n\u201cMay we both lead fulfilling lives. Farewell!\u201d Rishe lifted the skirts of her evening gown and turned on her heel, departing as briskly as she could.\n\u201cHow do you know about Mary? I haven\u2019t told you I love her!\u201d The prince was shouting something behind her, but she paid him no mind. She had things to do.\nDuring her first loop, the prince\u2019s accusations had shocked her to the core and she\u2014foolishly so\u2014had attempted to defend herself. Now she knew better than to expect the prince to behave reasonably. \nHow will life unfold this time? I\u2019m excited to find out! Rishe fixed her mind on the future.\nThis is my seventh \u201cdo-over.\u201d I\u2019ve led happy and carefree lives before, but this time\u2014this time, I swear I\u2019ll live a long happy and carefree life!\nIn other words, she needed to avoid getting killed. At any cost. \n \n***\n \nIn the first loop, with her engagement broken and her reputation in tatters, Rishe roamed with nothing but the clothes on jewelry. Finding them a good-natured band, she hitched a ride to a neighboring country.\nFrom the merchant caravan, she learned a trade, studying how to procure stock and balance ledgers. Eventually, she set out on her own to travel the world. Her upbringing as a daughter of the nobility meant that, even at fifteen years old, Rishe possessed a keen sense for beauty.\nShe collected things that caught her eye and sold them to whoever found delight in her wares. Before she realized it, she had become a major vendor, employing a full staff. She had even done business with the king of a desert nation and the prince of a frozen country up north. She traveled to many distant places, realizing a dream born from her cossetted former life spent doing nothing but preparing to be queen.\nFive years passed, and just as she had only one country left to visit, Rishe fell victim to the war sweeping across the continent.\nThe next thing she knew, she was fifteen years old again and back at that party, with the prince poised to make his pronouncement.\n\u201cRishe Irmgard Weitzner! You are a vile woman! A truly malicious creature unworthy of the crown prince! As of this instant, our engagement is off!\u201d\nNaturally, she didn\u2019t understand what was going on at first. She looked around. Everything was the same. She stood in the same place wearing the same dress and draped in the same jewelry she\u2019d sold to the caravan.\nWas it a dream? Or was everything that had happened up until then the dream? In her confusion, all she could do was stare.\nRishe hurried out of the ballroom, the impending threat of exile hanging over her and the prince\u2019s entreaties to halt ringing in her ears.\nThis is perfect! Now I can get it right! I\u2019ll grab everything valuable from my room.\nRishe had enjoyed her life as a merchant, but she had always felt a stirring of regret about this night. If only she\u2019d brought some funds from home, she would\u2019ve had the capital to establish her business much sooner!\nSpeaking of this regret always prompted disbelief from her customers, including the king of the desert. \u201cWhat? That\u2019s what you\u2019d want to do over?!\u201d\nWhen she arrived back at home on the night of her second life, Rishe grabbed her jewelry box and as many of the books her late grandmother had left her as she could carry, then made haste to the forest to meet the caravan. But the stop at her house took time, and she missed them completely.\nIn that moment, Rishe made a stark realization. Different choices meant different mistakes. Opening one door would close another.\nAnd so the easy path to a life in commerce was closed to her.\nSure, she could try to build her business from the ground up, but personal connections were almost as essential to being a merchant as business savvy. It just wasn\u2019t realistic without a single acquaintance. \nSorting through her belongings in resignation, she came across a foreign encyclopedia of herbs among her grandmother\u2019s books. Taking it as a sign, Rishe sold her jewels elsewhere and used the funds to cross the sea and pursue the study of medicine.\nFortunately, Rishe retained all her knowledge from her previous life. She remembered that certain expensive herbs could be acquired cheaply in other regions. When word spread of a disease running rampant in a neighboring country, she recalled that too. This foreknowledge proved invaluable, as did her wide travel and exposure to many different teachers with many different points of view.\nAs such, Rishe led a successful life as an apothecary. She saved a feeble prince, synthesized a number of rare medicines with her mercantile knowledge, and thus spent her days in the simple joy of helping those in need.\nUnfortunately, all the joy in the world couldn\u2019t stand up to an epidemic. Thus ended her second life. \nOnce again, she found herself in the moment of her broken engagement, the curtain rising on the third loop. Her next four lives proceeded much the same way. As a skilled lady\u2019s maid, she helped a young noblewoman to a fortuitous marriage. Once, she even disguised herself as a man and became a knight. Every life was worth living, and she enjoyed them all. She enjoyed living, period.\nThere was just one problem.\nNo matter what I do, I die at twenty.\nShe enjoyed her lives, but she was not permitted to do so for long. With this time limit always hanging over her, she spent each loop in a state of constant activity.\nI would love to take it easy for a while. Is a little leisure time too much to ask? Obviously I don\u2019t want to die either! This time, I\u2019ll make as much money as I can in the first five years. Then, when I turn twenty, I\u2019ll live a life free of worldly cares. I\u2019ll do whatever\u2019s necessary to stay alive!\nHer mind made up, Rishe began her seventh life in a dead sprint through the palace. Regardless of her future plans, she was in a race against time. She needed to beat the messenger bearing news of her scandal.\nAs she ran, she yanked off her hair ornaments; she planned to sell them and didn\u2019t want to risk losing one. Her hair billowed out behind her, falling in loose waves.\nSuddenly, an idea occurred to her, one she hadn\u2019t had in any of her previous six lives.\nLeaving through the palace gardens would be faster. I can climb down a tree from the balcony.\nRishe had gone to war as a knight in the life just before this one. After the punishing battlefield training, climbing trees was nothing.\nSeamlessly, she changed direction. She raced for the balcony, where she ran into something at full speed.\n\u201cBwargh!\u201d Rishe let out a very unladylike grunt, staggering a few steps. She looked up to see what she\u2019d bounced off of. \u201cOh\u2026\u201d\nAn exceptionally handsome man stood in her path.\nHe had refined, patrician features and cruel, thin lips. He was slender yet powerful; even through his clothes, Rishe could tell his body was well conditioned. His jet-black hair covered his ears, creeping down to the nape of his neck. The tips of his locks bounced with his movements. They looked to be soft to the touch.\nFrom head to toe, he was a pleasure to look at\u2014but what held Rishe\u2019s attention were his eyes. They were long in shape and impossibly blue, but they possessed a blade-sharp intensity. His gaze was clear, beautiful, and cold as ice. His eyelashes cast shadows on his striking face. He was a work of art.\nCurrently, this work of art was staring her down with a look that could kill.\nHe laughed. \u201cYou barreled right into me. For a moment, I thought I\u2019d been attacked by a wild boar.\u201d\nIt was an exceedingly rude thing to say to a stranger, but as luck would have it, this man was not a stranger. At least not to Rishe.\n\u201cWhat are you even doing here?\u201d the man went on. \u201cThe party is in the\u2014\u201d\nRishe interrupted him with a wordless shout of dismay. The man drew back, reflexively reaching for his sword. He composed himself with visible difficulty. \u201cWho are you? You look like any noblewoman, but your manner is\u2026\u201d \n\u201cEmperor Arnold Hein!\u201d \nThe man\u2019s eyes widened. He didn\u2019t mistake her surging contempt. Rishe had crossed swords with this man. Recently. He was the one responsible for ending her sixth life. \nHe must be a guest at the banquet. It makes sense.\nArnold Hein was the scion of a military nation not far from Rishe\u2019s home country of Hermity, the one in which they now stood. Their kingdoms, so recently at war, had brokered an ostensible peace, and the two ruling families met from time to time. Crown Prince Dietrich\u2019s engagement party would be one such occasion. He\u2019d gathered elites from far and wide to introduce to his beloved Mary.\nThe man eyed Rishe with rising curiosity. \u201cYou know me? This is my first time in Hermity.\u201d\nUh-oh. Rishe pasted on a smile as her mind spun in circles. This man was dangerous. She had to avoid entanglements with him at all costs. Five years from now, Arnold Hein would invade Hermity. \nHe was an extraordinarily skilled swordsman and, with a powerful military at his back, was destined to conquer kingdom after kingdom. He had done as much in her second, third, fourth, and fifth lives. In her sixth, Rishe had faced him in battle herself and died by his hand.\nWe never had a chance. That war was lost before it began.\nArnold\u2019s brilliance lay not in his swordplay but in his skill as a tactician. He set countries up for conquest and knocked them down, swallowing them one by one.\nI know him, but he doesn\u2019t know me. We haven\u2019t met in this life. I need an excuse fast. \nRishe curtsied slowly. \u201cMy name is Rishe Irmgard Weitzner. We\u2019ve never been introduced, but I\u2019ve heard of you.\u201d\nArnold donned an amused smile. \u201cYou plant your weight like a trained swordswoman. Your center of gravity is perfect.\u201d\n\u201cYou exaggerate,\u201d Rishe demurred. \u201cThat was simply a curtsy to an esteemed guest.\u201d \n\u201cI must have misheard, but I swear you called me \u2018emperor\u2019 just now.\u201d \nRishe froze.\n\u201cMy father yet lives,\u201d Arnold said. \u201cI am simply a crown prince. Why would you call me that?\u201d \n\u201cUh, um\u2026\u201d Rishe floundered for an answer.\nShe\u2019d made such a foolish mistake. Arnold\u2019s gaze cut right through her. It felt like he\u2019d see through any lie she told right down to her soul. She remembered this from the battlefield\u2014how his attention alone felt like a sword thrust.\nBut why even bother to lie? They\u2019d never meet again, so who cared what he thought of her? Sure, she harbored a hard feeling or two over the recent slaying, but there was no point complaining about it to this Arnold. Calling him the emperor was boorish, but Rishe was in the process of being forcibly exiled. Why play at diplomacy?\nShe took a deep breath and bowed low. This was not the curtsy of a noble lady but of a servant bowing in supplication to her master.\n\u201cMy humblest apologies, Your Highness. I was in a rush. Such a rude slip of the tongue.\u201d She raised her head. \u201cMy ex-fianc\u00e9 just annulled our engagement, so I\u2019ve got a lot on my mind. If you would excuse me.\u201d \n\u201cHe annulled your engagement?\u201d\nAt that, Rishe turned and fled.\nThis unexpected run-in with Arnold had taken up valuable time. She threw open the door to the balcony and hiked up her skirts, kicking off her shoes in anticipation of jumping into a tree. Looking down, she realized the ground was far closer than she\u2019d feared.\nExcellent! I can just drop into the garden!\nArnold, who up until now had been rendered speechless, shook himself out of his fugue as Rishe clambered over the railing. \u201cHey!\u201d\nRishe\u2019s moonlight-silver dress flowed around her as she leapt. The lawn was soft, but the fall was still far enough to risk injury.\nWeight evenly distributed on the soles of my feet, roll to transfer the impact to my shins and thighs, then onto my hips and my back.\nShe landed safely, rolled nimbly in her dress, and popped back up. Her hair was covered in leaves. \nI need to hurry up!\nBracing against a nearby rock, she used her weight to snap the heels off of her shoes. There. That would make running a little easier. Satisfied, she slipped them back on and made haste toward the family estate. \n \n***\n \nUp on the balcony, Crown Prince Arnold of Galkhein watched the spectacle play out from beginning to end. He gazed at the girl with the coral hair. Her appearance was that of any young noblewoman, but she moved like a well-trained knight. She\u2019d leapt from the balcony and landed skillfully, showing no signs of distress at her ripped dress or disheveled hair. Instead, she\u2019d knocked the heels off her shoes and dashed away.\nAlso, she had called him an emperor.\nPlaying it all over again in his head, Arnold broke out into a rare chuckle. As",

Otherwise, my brothers will never be happy.\u201d\n\u201cAnd you believe their happiness can only be achieved by sacrificing your own?\u201d\nMary gasped as she gaped at Rishe.\n\u201cYou don\u2019t need to throw away your own future to protect those you love,\u201d Rishe told her. \u201cNo matter what path you choose, never forget that.\u201d\n\u201cMy future?\u201d Mary\u2019s voice went ragged, like she was barely suppressing a wail of pain.\n\u201cI wish you a life where both you and your family can be happy,\u201d said Rishe.\nMary stood frozen in place, eyes gleaming like precious stones. Rishe couldn\u2019t help but admire how pretty she was. She truly did wish her happiness. But right now, she needed to take care of herself. \n\u201cWell.\u201d Rishe suddenly broke into a smile, making Dietrich flinch. \u201cI think it\u2019s time for me to be on my way.\u201d\nShe regretted losing access to her room, but she knew her parents wouldn\u2019t let her in. Turning her back on the crowd, Rishe contemplated her next move.\n\u201cWait, Lady Rishe!\u201d Mary\u2019s voice rang out.\n\u201cThat\u2019s right. You\u2019re not going anywhere, Rishe!\u201d The prince joined her. \u201cYou won\u2019t get away with treating me like trash to relieve your own injured heart.\u201d\n\u201cUgh, enough already!\u201d Rishe\u2019s patience was fraying. \u201cI don\u2019t have anything else to say to you. Goodbye!\u201d\n\u201cKnights, stop her!\u201d\nReluctantly, the knights moved to tail Rishe as she walked briskly back down the path. She sympathized with them, but she wasn\u2019t about to let them keep her here. Rounding a corner, she sensed something uncanny. She stopped, the knights quickly catching up with her.\n\u201cMy apologies, Lady Rishe. If you could please remain for just a\u2014whoa!\u201d\nRishe grabbed the hilt of the knight\u2019s sword. Yanking it from his belt, she spun around and stood at the ready. Metal rang against metal as Rishe parried a blow. She glared at her would-be attacker as he stepped out of the shadows.\nArnold Hein!\n\u201cWell, what do you know.\u201d The man smiling so sweetly while their swords locked was the very man who had ended her life. \u201cYou do have some skill.\u201d\nMetal screeched and slid, before Arnold sheathed his sword. Rishe lowered hers. Neither looked away.\n\u201cWho the hell are you?\u201d demanded one of the knights.\n\u201cStand down, good sirs,\u201d Rishe said. \u201cYour interference will only make this worse.\u201d\nThis mostly served to befuddle the knights further. Rishe absolutely couldn\u2019t allow them to come to blows with the crown prince of a friendly nation. And they couldn\u2019t beat him\u2014not even if they took him all at once. Rishe had blocked his blow, but her arm was completely numb. To think he\u2019d be even more powerful in five years.\nHe regarded her unabashedly. \u201cRishe, was that your name? Where did you learn such swordsmanship?\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m afraid I cannot say. Besides, you were clearly going easy on me.\u201d\n\u201cHa! You could tell?\u201d\nArnold\u2019s manner was throwing her off. He seemed to be enjoying himself. He\u2019s laughing. This monstrous prince is\u2026actually laughing.\nWhen she had met him in her other life, he was cold and merciless, like a genuine monster. And yet here he stood, mellow and smiling.\nThe Emperor Arnold Hein I knew was twenty-four years old, so he\u2019s, what? Nineteen now? This is so weird. He\u2019s grinning like a boy getting into a scrape.\nThat attack had been good-natured as well, almost playful. It had muscle behind it but certainly not any lethal intent. He\u2019d just wanted to force Rishe to catch the blow. She found it unbelievable that he could exude such an overpowering air of menace when he was just messing around.\nWhile Rishe was focused on Arnold, Mary and Dietrich caught up, seemingly recovered.\n\u201cExcuse me, my lord!\u201d Mary squeaked. \u201cI-I-I don\u2019t know who you are, but kindly step away from Lady Rishe!\u201d\n\u201cYes, do as she says! Who the hell are you, anyway?!\u201d\nDon\u2019t tell me Prince Dietrich doesn\u2019t recognize one of his personal guests.\nDietrich\u2019s interests did not lean toward diplomacy; he likely hadn\u2019t bothered to introduce himself to Arnold. Mary, for her part, seemed to grasp that Arnold wasn\u2019t ordinary. She stood up to defend Rishe, despite the tremble in her voice. In a better world, perhaps the two of them could have become friends.\n\u201cThat\u2019s your ex-fianc\u00e9?\u201d Arnold cocked a brow. \u201cHe\u2019s even worse than I imagined. Pathetic.\u201d\nDietrich flushed. \u201cI\u2019ll have your head!\u201d\n\u201cDietrich, I beg of you, contain yourself,\u201d Rishe said, then rounded on Arnold. \u201cAs for you, Your Highness\u2014you know who Dietrich is, and you know what speaking carelessly could mean. Are you trying to pick a fight?\u201d\n\u201cWhatever do you mean?\u201d Arnold\u2019s brows lifted high, making him the picture of innocence. \u201cBelieve me, Lady Rishe, every word I speak is chosen with extreme care.\u201d\nFinally realizing who Arnold was, Dietrich visibly paled. \u201cArnold? He\u2019s the crown prince of Galkhein?\u201d\nMary yelped. The knights stood down, shamefaced. The gossip-hungry neighbors who\u2019d gathered to witness a scandal play out drew back in fear.\n\u201cHe\u2019s the demon prince? The one who single-handedly destroyed a whole order of enemy knights?\u201d\n\u201cWatch your tongue, fool! Do you want him to do the same to you?\u201d\nThe two nations enjoyed peaceful relations, but Arnold remained the dreaded prince, heir to the throne of a former enemy. Current rumor wasn\u2019t as widespread as it would be in five years, but he was still regarded with distrust.\nThe onlookers stood rooted to the spot, too terrified to flee.\nWell, this has devolved into a full-fledged disaster.\nRishe heaved a frustrated sigh. \u201cPrince Arnold, to what do we owe this honor? Surely a crown prince would not draw his sword for a mere jest.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m here on business,\u201d Arnold said. \u201cBut first, I must beg forgiveness for my rudeness.\u201d\nHuh, what do you know? Once he became emperor, he\u2019d gladly behead any subject who so much as dared speak a word against him.\nI guess at nineteen he still knew how to apologize.\nIf that surprised her, Arnold\u2019s next act completely obliterated her sense of reality. \nWith a flourish, he fell to his knees. \n\u201cHuh?\u201d Is this actually happening? \nHe was a man destined for an imperial crown. A man who would stand at the head of a military powerhouse and spread his rule across continents.\nArnold, known for his frigid pride, knelt to the disgraced daughter of a duke.\nAnd not only that\u2014his head was bowed, looking nothing so much as a knight swearing allegiance to his lady. If it were anyone else, it would be a delightful, pious image. Instead, the assembled looked on in terrified awe.\nNot Rishe, though.\n\u201cWhat are you doing?\u201d she hissed. \u201cGet up!\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m apologizing for my baseless impertinence. Also, I\u2019m asking you\u2026\u201d He trailed off to take Rishe\u2019s hand, tugging her forward so forcefully she staggered. He gazed up at her.\nUgh. He\u2019s so beautiful. No matter how many times she looked at him, it didn\u2019t become any less disarming. Long eyelashes, arched brows, a noble nose. His bright blue eyes reminded her of the drift ice she\u2019d seen in a northern kingdom, gazing out from a ship in one of her past lives. She knew she was dwelling on this to buy time, even as the reality before her sank in.\n\u201c\u2026to become my wife.\u201d\nShe froze, unable to process the words. \u201cWhat?\u201d Rishe glanced around, desperately searching the faces of the crowd. They all seemed as stunned as she felt. She looked down at Arnold again. \u201cYour wife?\u201d \n\u201cYes, that\u2019s right.\u201d\n\u201cYou want me to become your wife?\u201d\n\u201cYes.\u201d\nRishe couldn\u2019t speak. This was truly happening. It was real. It clicked into place in her head, and she let out a strangled grunt.\nWhat is going on? Why is this happening?\nShock lapped at her, fuzzing at the corners of her vision. He wanted to marry her. Arnold wanted to marry Rishe. Her murderer wanted to marry her.\nWhy is he doing this? He must have some ulterior motive, a broader goal. But I have to give him an answer.\nThe onlookers were holding their breath as Rishe said flatly, \u201cI reject your proposal.\u201d\nArnold said nothing.\nShe had to reject him. She was going to live a long, peaceful, carefree life, damn it, and no one would stop her. And yet\u2026\nArnold began to laugh, and the deep, creeping sense of dread inside Rishe only grew. Why does he seem so amused by this?!\n \n***\n \nHer previous life was her sixth. Disguised as a man, Rishe rose as a warrior of an island country she came upon in her travels. It was a conventional yet charming kingdom formed of red brick. After striking up a friendship with a group of knights who didn\u2019t realize she was a woman, Rishe followed their advice and joined them.\nThe training was grueling enough to make her wish she were dead. Back when she had lived as a noble, she\u2019d learned how to wield a sword for basic self-defense, but training as a noble lady had in no way prepared her for this. She drilled relentlessly, barely taking the time to sleep. Just as she became a full-fledged knight, Emperor Arnold\u2019s forces lay siege to the castle.\n \n***\n \nHow could this happen? \nIn her seventh life, Rishe wearily sank into her chair. Across from her sat Arnold, his legs crossed and chin propped up on his hand, watching her lazily.\n\u201cWhat\u2019s the matter?\u201d he asked. \u201cYou seem unhappy.\u201d\n\u201cYou could say that.\u201d Even her voice was grumpy. Still, she couldn\u2019t very well tell him it was because she bore a grudge from a previous life. After the first time her life rewound to that pivotal moment, she\u2019d resolved to keep her loops a secret. \u201cI had plans for my exile. A brand-new life. And now because of you, my parents are involved. Even the king has heard about it!\u201d\nAfter Rishe rejected Arnold, Dietrich had immediately cried out, \u201cTh-the crown prince of Galkhein proposed to Rishe?!\u201d\nHis shrieks were loud enough to attract the attention of the master and mistress of the manor.\nWhen her parents came out, Rishe had protested, \u201cI\u2019m not going to marry him! I\u2019m leaving the country just as Dietrich commanded.\u201d\nNo one listened. Their faces just paled with nervous confusion.\nJust then, a glittering coach arrived. Half-stuck in the mud, the man inside it was forced to trudge over the swampy ground, and so the king of Hermity himself arrived, staggering and dirt-stained. \nHe grabbed hold of his son\u2019s collar, pushing him into a low bow. He then turned to Prince Arnold and said, rather loudly, \u201cYour Highness! Allow me to apologize for my son\u2019s foolishness! You are an esteemed guest all the way from Galkhein! It is unthinkable he would not offer you the courtesy you are due!\u201d\n\u201cYou\u2019re hurting me, Father! My back!\u201d\nThe king then turned to Rishe. \u201cMy lady, allow me to sincerely apologize as both a king and a father. My son\u2019s behavior toward you has been utterly disgraceful. I beg you to please give Prince Arnold\u2019s proposal due consideration. Not only for your own",
    "query_text": " sake but for the sake of your country.\u201d\nThe king bowed to her as deeply as his son had to Arnold, and her parents joined him. Rishe felt dizzy at the sight of this abject debasement in the presence of citizens.\nArnold, who had been watching the proceedings with a detached amusement, sobered and stepped toward the king. \u201cYour Majesty, please rise.\u201d\nWithout the smirk, Arnold\u2019s face immediately reverted to its cold mask. The king didn\u2019t move. Maybe something in Arnold\u2019s voice kept him frozen.\n\u201cSuch a"

They\u2019ll be invited to Galkhein to discuss the wedding ceremony.\u201d\n\u201cThank you,\u201d Rishe said. \u201cI\u2019m glad you kept your word.\u201d\n\u201cThe Aria Trading Company,\u201d Arnold mused. \u201cI\u2019ve heard of them. They\u2019re up-and-comers, aren\u2019t they? Have you done business with them before?\u201d\n\u201cNo, but I heard from a friend that they hold a very high standard of quality.\u201d\nRishe was pleasantly surprised at how easily Arnold had acceded to her request. Typically, a royal household had their own personal dealer. Getting them to do business with someone else could be difficult.\nI want to establish a connection with Aria as soon as possible, Rishe thought. It was, of course, the company that had taken her in during her first life.\nThe company had been established just two years prior to picking her up by its owner, a man named Tully. They were still in their growth stage, but in just a few years, they would be the grandest trading company in all the world. They\u2019d proven a great boon in her life as an apothecary as well, helping to distribute her newest medicines. She\u2019d struggled to win their trust initially, but she pledged to work much harder this time around.\nThis marriage isn\u2019t going to happen\u2014I need an escape plan for when it all falls apart. I must bring to bear all my knowledge and influence as a crown princess.\nRishe didn\u2019t know Arnold\u2019s plans, but she had no intention of sitting around and waiting for him to use her as he pleased. She\u2019d spend her time as his consort wisely. Everything must serve her ultimate goal: to live longer than five years, and live well.\nHer fierce determination must have shown on her face because Arnold gave her a little bemused smile. \u201cYes?\u201d\nGod! Rishe grimaced at that flawlessly handsome countenance. Such beauty, possessed by such powerful destruction. The fact that he\u2019d been the man to kill her did nothing to lessen her fascination. In fact, it almost made it worse. The study of contrasts.\n\u201cSorry, I just\u2014\u201d\nShe was interrupted by the horses\u2019 loud whinnies.\n\u201cStop! Hey, stop the coach!\u201d\nShouts drifted back from conveyance ahead of theirs, which contained the luggage and attendants. The squadron of knights tailing the column of coaches sped off toward the front.\n\u201cWho do you think you\u2014graaargh!\u201d\nThat didn\u2019t sound good. Rishe moved to climb out, but Arnold was faster. He drew his sword.\n\u201cHey!\u201d\nArnold locked the door from the outside. \u201cStay hidden.\u201d\nWhy is he putting himself in danger? That\u2019s what knights are for! The fact that Rishe had been about to do the same thing didn\u2019t occur to her. It\u2019s probably bandits. He told me to stay hidden in here, but I\u2019m not so sure about that.\nArnold had left her locked in from the outside, hoping to keep her safe, but Rishe didn\u2019t like her odds. There were five coaches, but this one was certainly the grandest. It locked on the inside as well, but that wouldn\u2019t stop someone with enough determination. If she did as she was told, she\u2019d just be waiting patiently for a bandit to break a window and drag her out.\nKeeping one eye on the coachmen fleeing into the forest, Rishe began a methodical search for something to help her. Right\u2014her hairpin!\nThis sure brings me back. She unfastened it, twisting it into the gap in the door. Back when I was a maid, my lady would lock herself in her chambers all the time to avoid her studies. I had to break her out just like this.\nThe lock on the coach was simple, and it came open easily. Once she was free, she scanned her surroundings. She didn\u2019t see anyone who looked immediately hostile, but there was noise up ahead. Cautiously, she headed toward it.\nBefore long, she found Arnold.\nWow.\nRoughly ten men\u2014the bandits, she presumed\u2014lay crumpled on the ground. In their midst stood Arnold, in the process of tripping another man into the dirt. He scowled, blade at the man\u2019s throat. \u201cIs that it, then?\u201d\n\u201cGwugh!\u201d\nArnold kicked the bandit in the stomach, eyes blazing with cruelty. \u201cThat\u2019s all the thrill you offer me after I went to the trouble of drawing my sword? Barely worth it. I\u2019m bored already.\u201d\nHe wasn\u2019t angry; on the contrary, he stared his enemies down with chilly disappointment, as if this had all been a letdown. Even Arnold\u2019s own knights seemed terrified of their master when he was in a mood. Arnold smoothly flicked the blood off his sword, wiping the blade on the bandit\u2019s shirt before sheathing it. The rest of the men on the ground seemed to be unconscious.\nWait, he didn\u2019t kill anyone? Why not? Is it because we haven\u2019t reached Galkhein?\nShe supposed even Arnold knew better than to go around killing the citizens of other countries. Or perhaps he had yet to become the ruthless monster she knew him as.\nArnold seemed to sense her gaze, turning around with a start. Genuine emotion bloomed on his face, worlds away from the blank mask he wore to face down the bandits. \u201cHow did you get out of the coach?\u201d\nRishe shrugged. \u201cIf I tell you, you\u2019ll be able to prevent me from doing it again.\u201d\nArnold snickered. \u201cYou continue to amaze me.\u201d\nHow can you go from ice-cold to suddenly looking like a normal nineteen-year-old? It\u2019s disconcerting. \nRishe fought down her disquiet as a man alighted from a coach and shouted, \u201cYour Highness! Not again!\u201d He was Oliver, one of the prince\u2019s attendants. He had silver hair and was roughly as tall as Arnold.\n\u201cWhat do you think all these knights are for, decoration? Why do you insist on endangering yourself?\u201d\nRishe had only met Oliver briefly a few days ago, but he didn\u2019t appear to be intimidated by Arnold at all. And, well\u2026he\u2019s not wrong.\nShe feared the menace would return to Arnold\u2019s expression, but he just looked annoyed. \u201cI could tell they were prepared to kill. I\u2019d prefer to take the burden on myself than risk multiple injuries so far afield. And we already have casualties.\u201d\nHe was right. Several injured knights leaned listlessly among the trees. Arnold issued orders to those still able-bodied. \u201cFirst squad, see to the wounded. Second squad, arrest these men.\u201d\n\u201cYes, sir!\u201d\nOliver appeared unsatisfied. \u201cYour Highness, that is a weak justification. I\u2019m overjoyed you\u2019re well, but you must consider Lady Rishe. Perhaps next time we run into a team of murderous brigands, you could allow your consort to remain in the coach.\u201d\n\u201cI told her to remain in the coach!\u201d\nRishe quickly averted her gaze, turning her attention to the wounded knights. They didn\u2019t appear badly injured, yet they all seemed exhausted.\n\u201cExcuse me, can I take a look?\u201d Rishe approached the knight acting as a medic. He looked round, startled by her presence.\n\u201cNonsense, my lady. Don\u2019t trouble yourself, you must have had quite a scare.\u201d\nThis was not unreasonable, but the wariness in his eyes made it clear he wanted her nowhere near his comrade. He isn\u2019t just being polite. He truly is on guard. \nBeside them, an injured knight groaned as another helped him up. \u201cWhat\u2019s wrong with you?\u201d the second knight asked the first. \n\u201cI-I feel\u2026numb.\u201d\n\u201cWhat? Damn.\u201d The knight grabbed up one of the fallen bandit\u2019s swords, going pale as he inspected the blade. \u201cYour Highness, look at this. Poison.\u201d\nArnold clicked his tongue. \u201cLocate every laceration and bind them close to the heart. Suck the poison from the wounds.\u201d\nHe mostly got that right, at least. In the meantime, Rishe located the nearest bound bandit and pulled his dagger out of its sheath. Its wet coating gleamed in the sunlight, just as the knight had said.\nThey applied the poison liberally\u2014whatever it is must be cheap and easily bought in bulk.\nShe wafted the smell toward her, bracing for something rancid, but detected nothing. Then she brought it closer to her nose.\nIt smells sweet, like an overripe apple. Shea grass and\u2026bluecap mushrooms. All the knights appear to have the same symptoms, so I won\u2019t have to check every blade.\nRishe stood back up and headed for the coach.\nOliver took a step after her. \u201cYour Highness, Lady Rishe is\u2014\u201d\n\u201cLeave her. She may do as she pleases.\u201d\n\u201cShe\u2019s well trained,\u201d Oliver mused. \u201cBut a battlefield is no place for a young lady. She probably wasn\u2019t prepared for such a dreadful spectacle.\u201d\nRishe ignored the murmurs and focused on her work. There they are. I\u2019ll take these, these, and\u2026\n\u201cThe poison must be a sleeping drug,\u201d she overheard Arnold saying. \u201cHunters use such drugs to weaken larger prey. I doubt this dose is lethal.\u201d\n\u201cBut it certainly is annoying,\u201d replied Oliver. \u201cWe\u2019re still two days out from Galkhein. Lugging a company of sleeping men in armor won\u2019t be pleasant.\u201d\n\u201cWe\u2019ll have to stop somewhere nearby. A hunter\u2019s settlement. Perhaps they will have an antidote\u2014\u201d\n\u201cExcuse me.\u201d Rishe, who\u2019d returned from the carriage, raised a hand. \u201cI have an antidote.\u201d\n\u201cWhat?\u201d\nThe entire company stared at her in awe.\n \n***\n \nAs it turned out, Arnold\u2019s guess was right. \nThis sweet-smelling substance was a hunter\u2019s drug, made from ingredients that were only toxic in their raw form. Heat rendered them harmless. Rishe had encountered this poison several times before, curing a customer afflicted with it during her life as an apothecary.\n\u201cA lethal dose for a grown man would fill a wine glass. They likely got less than a hundredth of that,\u201d Rishe explained to Arnold, not looking up from her work. \u201cStill, the numbness can block their airways with the roots of their tongues. It\u2019s best to lay them on their sides.\u201d\n\u201cYes, I understand the theory and the solution.\u201d Arnold gazed down at Rishe\u2019s hands. \u201cThe part I\u2019m struggling with is why you\u2019re the one telling me this.\u201d\n\u201cWell, I know how to make the antidote,\u201d Rishe said patiently as she muddled the herbs together in the white soup bowl she\u2019d borrowed for her flowers. She crushed them with the back of a spoon before adding another dried flower, crushing that as well, and combining them to form a paste. This process would be easier with a pestle, but she wasn\u2019t about to complain. \u201cThis poison is common\u2014it\u2019s cheap and easy to make, which often means the antidote is simple as well.\u201d\nThe antidote was synthesized, in fact, when hunters witnessed a deer showing no symptoms after eating a certain mushroom. They tested those along with other common herbs the deer ate. Rishe mentally thanked them for their scientific rigor as she added a bit of water, straining it all through a cloth.\nRishe stood up, brandishing the bowl of bright green medicine. \u201cBoiling would make the antidote more potent, but this works in a pinch.\u201d\nThat was when she noticed the astonished stares. Unsure of what social faux paus she\u2019d perpetrated, she looked away. Oliver was completely stunned. Arnold looked thoughtful. It was imperative the knights were treated as soon as possible, but to Rishe\u2019s dismay, no one was moving. \nDo they not trust me? That makes sense. Anyone would be reluctant to use medicine concocted by a complete stranger. But the longer we wait, the harder the poison will become to cure. \nShe needed to dispel their doubts. Rolling up her sleeve, Rishe approached Arnold and drew his sword from its scabbard. \u201cI need to borrow this for a moment, Your Highness.\u201d\n\u201cWhat are you\u2014\u201d\nShe pushed the blade against the soft skin of her inner arm. Blood welled up, along with the sharp sting of pain. Nothing compared to her injuries sustained during her life as a knight, though.\nArnold did not share her nonchalance. \u201cWhat do you think you\u2019re doing?!\u201d\nHe grabbed for her arm. She stepped out of his grasp. Was blood truly so shocking? She didn\u2019t have the time to worry about it. Clutching the overfull bowl, Rishe hurried back to the knights.\n\u201cDon\u2019t worry. This isn\u2019t poison,\u201d Rishe said. She demonstrated as much by drizzling it with a spoon over her own fresh wound. It stung. That meant the ingredients were working.\n\u201cThis is crushed liquori grass, luqua flowers, and carilya nuts. I\u2019ll swallow some if that\u2019s what it takes to prove it\u2019s safe.\u201d It was horribly bitter; she hoped it wouldn\u2019t come to that. \u201cThe paralysis will last for days. Please make up your mind quickly.\u201d\n\u201cMake up our mind?\u201d\n\u201cWill you allow me to cure the poison? Or would you rather drag paralyzed soldiers all the way to Galkhein? I suppose you could waste His Highness\u2019s time searching for a hunter\u2019s settlement to use their antidote.\u201d She smiled serenely. \u201cIt makes no difference to us. Right, Your Highness?\u201d\nIn the end, Rishe applied the antidote.\nThe recovery took a few hours. While they waited, Rishe picked herbs in the same meadow she\u2019d been gazing at with yearning from the carriage. A fortuitous turn of events. She found anti-inflammatory herbs and flowers to ease sour bellies, ingredients for curing headaches, and mushrooms for inducing slumber. She wrapped them all up in a handkerchief.\nIn the meantime, Arnold dispatched a messenger to this region\u2019s lord, making arrangements to",

After coordinating with Oliver, he drifted over to Rishe.\n\u201cI see your interest in flowers is mercenary, rather than ornamental,\u201d he said, surveying the heaps of herbs gathered on the bank of the pond. He sat down beside her.\nWhen he didn\u2019t say anything more, Rishe went back to work plucking leaves from plants with valuable stems. The leaves had no medicinal effects, but they did make a decent broth. Slumber mushroom spores were a nuisance unless dried; they were spread out beside her in the sun.\nI wonder, would he be annoyed if I attached herbs to the roof of the coach? That would be"

    "prefix_text": " matter?\u201d Rishe asked.\n\u201cI sent orders ahead to have a detached wing of the palace prepared for us, but it seems the preparations are behind schedule. I\u2019m sorry, but you\u2019ll need to stay in a guest room in the main palace for a few days.\u201d\n\u201cOh, I don\u2019t mind if the wing isn\u2019t ready,\u201d Rishe said. \u201cWe can head over there now.\u201d\n\u201cIt hasn\u2019t been used in quite a while. It\u2019ll be covered in dust.\u201d\n\u201cI said that I didn\u2019t mind if it was a mess, remember? But there\u2019s no need for you to put yourself out. By all means, stay in the main palace for as long as you need.\u201d Rishe had spent a life as a maid\u2014dust didn\u2019t scare her. \u201cBesides, I\u2019m a hostage, after all.\u201d\n\u201cYou could at least attempt to sound distressed,\u201d Arnold said with the slightest trace of petulance. \nRishe, who had a huge grin spreading over her face and her chest puffed out with pride, didn\u2019t respond.\n \n***\n \nThe detached wing turned out to be just a separate palace in the distant corner of the grounds\u2014a scant four stories tall and, as advertised, absolutely swimming in dust.\nNot so bad, though. Rishe had pictured decay and clutter, but it was mostly just bare. Bare and musty, but not rotten or falling apart.\n\u201cYou can do whatever you want with this place. I\u2019ll be occupied over the next few days, but feel free to use the guest apartments in the main palace if you get tired of choking to death,\u201d Arnold said before he left.\nAccording to Oliver, work had piled up while the prince was away, and it wasn\u2019t just a few things that could be dispensed with over a few days working around the clock.\nEmperor Arnold Hein\u2026 He\u2019s just a crown prince right now, but I still wish I knew what\u2019s going on in his head. For now, I\u2019ll just focus on what I can do. Like make this place livable.\nShe changed into her plainest dress and rolled up her sleeves. The knights who\u2019d remained to serve as her guard kept watch over her as she went from window to window, throwing them all open.\nIn a stroke of luck, the weather was good, and the detached wing was well placed to soak up the sun. The lack of any creature comforts made it look ascetic and drab, but once it was furnished, Rishe had no doubt it would be lovely.\nLeaving the top floors to air out, Rishe found the stairs to the basement. She pushed the heavy wooden doors open, and mice skittered over her feet. The knights yelped as Rishe descended into the darkness.\n\u201cL-Lady Rishe, why are you going down here?\u201d\n\u201cCleaning supplies are usually kept in the basement. See?\u201d\nThe knights followed her gaze to a duster, broom, dustpan, and pile of fresh cloths. She filled a bucket with water and went to work, rolling up a handkerchief to cover her mouth as she swept dust down from high on the walls. Then she swept up all the dust on the floor.\nIt\u2019s always satisfying to tackle a place this filthy.\nShe corralled the dust bunnies until they were piled up like snow in the center of the hall, and then she swept them out the open door. Once the floors were free of debris, she attacked them with the cloth.\n\u201cLady Rishe, is there anything we can do to help?\nRishe was grateful for the knight\u2019s offer, but she shook her head. \u201cYour job is to guard me, not do my housekeeping.\u201d\n\u201cThis is quite the place to clean on your own, detached though it may be,\u201d the knight said hesitantly. \u201cIt\u2019s not too late to move into the guest chambers instead.\u201d\n\u201cThat\u2019s all right. I like the place already.\u201d\nRishe remained steadfast in her refusal for one reason: readying guest chambers was an awful chore. The palace maids would be expected to work overnight to prepare them, even if the guests were only staying a single night. No speck of dust or strand of hair could remain. Certainly no wrinkled sheets. Rishe knew how exhausting and rigorous a maid\u2019s job was, how nerve-racking.\nShe refused to put the poor dears through such an ordeal for just a few days\u2019 stay. From the sound of things, the palace wasn\u2019t equipped with many housemaids. No doubt they already had their hands full.\n\u201cBesides, take a look.\u201d She held out her arms wide, gesturing to her sparkling clean floor. The knights stared at the bright room in admiration. \u201cCleaning a place with your own hands makes living there that much more satisfying, you see.\u201d\nThe knights smiled their awkward but good-natured agreement.\nRishe worked tirelessly, and before long, the chambers where she would spend the night were ready. The knights offered to carry in the bed, which she allowed.\nWhile they brought in furniture, Rishe started cleaning another room. She had run out of clean water, so she quietly slipped out to the well without informing the knights. It wasn\u2019t quite fair to them, but these were the palace grounds. Surely she didn\u2019t need to be chaperoned everywhere.\nBesides, they\u2019re guards in name only. They\u2019re clearly just here to report my movements to Arnold Hein, Rishe reflected as she walked through a courtyard full of flowers, bucket in hand. Iridescent butterflies cavorted playfully around her feet. He doesn\u2019t seem in a hurry to introduce me to the king. Although if I\u2019m just a hostage, that doesn\u2019t surprise me.\nShe hoped she got to meet the current emperor at least once. The future Arnold\u2019s violent conquest only began after he killed the man and made himself emperor, after all.\nI wonder what happened to Arnold Hein after I died in my past life. Did he reign supreme after winning his war? Or did some country manage to put a stop to his conquest? Whatever the case, I absolutely cannot allow him to start a conflict this time. Being the empress of a wartime nation sounds like so much work! The very thought is unacceptable!\nPerhaps they could divorce, but Rishe had a feeling that if Arnold decided to discard her in the middle of a war, she would fail in",
    "query_text": " her mission to make it past the age of twenty. Better to avoid the situation all together.\nWait. When she thought about it, the cause of every single one of Rishe\u2019s deaths was Arnold and his war. I died fighting. I died when Galkhein\u2019s army invaded\u2026\nLooking at her six lives, all of them had ended in more or less the same way.\nRishe found herself crouched on the ground, cradling her head in her hands. Maybe we should get a divorce right now. But it wasn\u2019t in Rishe\u2019s nature to take back her decisions once she\u2019d made them. \nIf I leave, I\u2019ll probably just die in some war-related disaster again.

Shall I spin around so you have a better view?\u201d\nOliver blinked. \u201cI beg your pardon?\u201d\n\u201cYou\u2019re looking me over like I\u2019m a horse for sale. If there\u2019s anything I can help you with, please let me know.\u201d\nOliver\u2019s brows went up. He let out a little breath of resignation. \u201cHis Highness was right. You do possess the keen perception of a knight. Of course, I\u2019m purely an amateur myself.\u201d\nI\u2019d say this was a merchant\u2019s sixth sense, rather than battle intuition.\nThis wasn\u2019t the first time Rishe had caught Oliver looking at her. It reminded her of the way her noble customers would examine a product, assessing worth and authenticity. Or a merchant weeding out potential merchandise from a wide array of choices.\nIn other words, he was appraising her.\nOliver moved into a deep, sweeping bow. \u201cMy sincerest apologies, my lady. I have been unaccountably rude to my lord\u2019s consort. My behavior was unacceptable.\u201d\nRishe shook her head. \u201cPlease don\u2019t, it\u2019s fine.\u201d It wasn\u2019t unreasonable for the prince\u2019s closest attendant to be wary of strangers. But it did make her curious. \u201cHow long have you worked for Arnold? Have you always been a valet?\u201d\n\u201cI trained as a squire, actually,\u201d Oliver replied. \u201cBut I was injured and dismissed from the order. His Highness took me into his household soon after. I have served him for nearly a decade.\u201d\n\u201cThen maybe you can answer this,\u201d Rishe said. \u201cWhy is Prince Arnold so very intent on making me his wife?\u201d\nOliver hesitated, as if weighing the pros and cons of speaking, \u201cTo be quite honest, I was as surprised as you were. He\u2019s always insisted he had no interest in marriage. But the sight of you in Hermity has changed his mind. Apparently.\u201d\nSo not even his attendant understood his motives. Rishe remained at a complete loss.\n\u201cIf I may, however?\u201d Oliver mistook Rishe\u2019s confusion for anxiety and added, \u201cI have served Prince Arnold for a long time, and never before have I seen him so happy. When he is with you, he laughs. His smiles are sincere.\u201d\nRishe was taken aback. She\u2019d figured all of Arnold\u2019s laughter and teasing was at her expense. His own private jokes.\n\u201cAre you\u2026unhappy with him?\u201d Oliver ventured. \u201cWith his looks, His Highness is exceedingly popular with the ladies of the court, you know.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m sure he has many admirers.\u201d She paused. \u201cWould you really call the way he acts around me \u2018happy\u2019? To me, it seems more like a cat with a mouse.\u201d\nOliver laughed. He didn\u2019t deny it. \u201cI am pleased you understand His Highness so well. Oh, I nearly forgot. Here.\u201d\nHe held out a sheaf of three documents. \u201cThis is the guest list for your wedding. His Highness bids you look over it.\u201d\n\u201cThank you,\u201d Rishe said, pleasantly surprised. She hadn\u2019t even needed to ask. She gave it a quick glance, quickly identifying the most prominent and powerful names.\nKing Zahad, Prince Kyle, Princess Harriet. And from the Kingdom of Domana, we have Lord Jonal attending as the representative of the king. No surprise there.\nMore than a wedding guest register, this was a list of key people from the countries Arnold would go on to antagonize. Even before the murder of the king and the start of the war, there must have been a trigger\u2014a sea change in the affairs of state. Everyone on this list was most likely involved.\nKing Zahad. I hope we can be friends again like in my first life. Hmm\u2026 Prince Kyle is rather frail. I hope he isn\u2019t working himself too hard. He has a strong sense of responsibility\u2014he\u2019ll attend the wedding even though it\u2019ll be a long trip.\nThe sight of these names filled Rishe with a longing for those lives, for the people she\u2019d once known. And sometime in the very near future, they would all be Galkhein\u2019s enemies.\nIf I take matters into my own hands, perhaps I can salvage some of these relationships before they sour. Even if we aren\u2019t allies, we don\u2019t have to be enemies. Anything to stave off the outbreak of war.\nOliver had no idea what was going through Rishe\u2019s head. Brightly, he continued their conversation. \u201cThe ceremony will be held in three months\u2019 time. All preparations must be complete by then. And now\u2026we need to discuss tonight\u2019s party.\u201d\n\u201cTonight\u2019s what?\u201d\nOliver stiffened. \u201cDid His Highness not tell you?\u201d\n\u201cNo, he most certainly did not! There\u2019s to be a party?\u201d\n\u201cUgh, not again!\u201d Oliver dug his knuckles into his forehead.\nRishe put two and two together. She hesitated, then said, \u201cSo there is one, then. As you must know, His Highness is trying to stamp it down without telling me.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d Oliver replied. \u201cHe should have mentioned it to you. You don\u2019t need to attend, but he will. At least, I hope he will. I think I managed to convince him.\u201d\nShe sympathized with Oliver. Under normal circumstances, it would be unheard of for the crown prince and his fianc\u00e9e to fail to appear at a banquet. \u201cDon\u2019t worry, Oliver. I\u2019ll go.\u201d\nOliver let out a sigh of relief. \u201cReally? Thank you so much, my lady. I\u2019ll put finding you a maid at the top of my to-do list.\u201d\n\u201cNo need.\u201d Rishe smiled. \u201cI can prepare for the party on my own.\u201d\nThis maid-selection process made Rishe uneasy. After witnessing that exchange between the servants in the garden, she imagined quarrels breaking out all through the palace. And she doubted the disputes would go away even after they decided.\nOliver frowned. \u201cBut won\u2019t dressing be difficult without a lady\u2019s maid?\u201d \nShe shook her head. \u201cI can do my hair and put on a gown by myself. I brought dresses and cosmetics from home. Don\u2019t worry.\u201d\nRishe ignored Oliver\u2019s stunned look, already reevaluating her cleaning plans.\n \n***\n \nThe first thing Rishe said to Arnold that night was, \u201cYour Highness, I have a request.\u201d Her gown rustled as she leaned in close. \u201cI would like some herb seed and a corner of the gardens. I made a list. I hope we can discuss this in more detail later.\u201d\nArnold was silent a moment. \u201cRishe.\u201d\n\u201cWhat? Didn\u2019t you tell me to let you know if there was anything I wanted?\u201d She looked at him quizzically, and Arnold sighed.\nShe\u2019d heard that he\u2019d finished his mountain",
    "query_text": " of work and even managed to sleep for a while. He was dressed in his usual military black, trimmed with a red mantle and black gloves.\nArnold shook his head. \u201cThat\u2019s not what I mean. I\u2019m guessing that Oliver didn\u2019t tell you the reason for this party? It\u2019s merely for appearance\u2019s sake. I need to look like I\u2019m searching for a bride within our borders as well. There\u2019s no reason for you to attend.\u201d\nIt made sense. The crown prince\u2014the greatest catch in the kingdom\u2014marrying a foreigner without even the slightest nod to propriety would invite unwanted discontent from the nobility.\n\u201cHowever, we\u2019re betrothed,\u201d Arnold said. \u201cThis whole evening is merely a formality. And with news that you\u2019re my \u2018hostage\u2019 going around, you\u2019ll be an object of curiosity. I don\u2019t want to put you through that.\u201d\n\u201cWell, I already"

And why bother spicing it enough to singe the tongue if she just planned to ruin my dress? Pick a plan, my dear.\nHiding her exasperation, Rishe smiled brightly. \u201cI\u2019ve never had a wine quite like this. What an unusual scent.\u201d\nCornelia bit her lip in frustration. Rishe beamed at her. You\u2019ve got such a pretty face, Lady Toona. Why don\u2019t you smile?\nRishe leaned in close to Cornelia. \u201cThis vintage isn\u2019t available where I\u2019m from. I\u2019m ever so anxious to learn more. Should I perhaps invite Prince Arnold over to enjoy a glass? Which tray did you get this from?\u201d\n\u201cWhat? Oh, um\u2026\u201d Rishe had a policy of never backing down from a fight, but it seemed Cornelia didn\u2019t share it. \u201cS-sorry, but I don\u2019t remember. Such a large hall, you see.\u201d\n\u201cA shame. I\u2019ll just give His Highness this one, then. I\u2019ll be sure to let him know who it\u2019s from.\u201d\n\u201cUh, wait!\u201d Cornelia rapidly shook her head. \u201cI-I got that glass for you, so I think you should\u2014you know what? Never mind! Maybe I should just take that\u2014oh no!\u201d\nRishe ignored the ashen-faced Cornelia, raising the glass and swallowing down a gulp. \n\u201cI-I can\u2019t believe\u2026\u201d\n\u201cSuch a spicy flavor, just as I imagined.\u201d Rishe smiled again to the assembled group\u2019s astonishment. \u201cWhat a warm welcome. I do hope the two of us can spend more time together. Perhaps\u2026a tea party?\u201d\n\u201cTh-the two of us?\u201d Cornelia stammered.\n\u201cYes. I want to know all about House Toona.\u201d\nCornelia looked flabbergasted, but she recovered herself and nodded.\nThat should do. One of Rishe\u2019s eventual plans required a plot of land in a temperate climate. House Toona\u2019s would likely be perfect, but she needed to confirm a few things with Cornelia. Never back down from a fight. Even further\u2026\nShe recalled the words of her mentor from her days as a merchant.\nDon\u2019t bother with fights you can\u2019t win.\nThe other ladies fled, fearful of this strange girl who gulped down painfully spicy wine like it was nothing. \n \n***\n \nRishe retreated to the empty balcony to enjoy the music, grimacing with every stinging mouthful of wine. She drank it in decreasing sips until Arnold joined her.\n\u201cWhat are you making that face for?\u201d\nRishe swirled the glass. \u201cDon\u2019t worry, it\u2019s not you. It\u2019s just this wine is so spicy.\u201d\n\u201cSpicy? The wine is?\u201d\n\u201cMm. It\u2019s seasoned with capsicum. I barely managed to get that first mouthful down without gagging.\u201d\nArnold swiped the glass from her hand. \u201cDon\u2019t tell me this was a poisoning attempt!\u201d\nRishe clicked her tongue in annoyance at her own lack of vigilance. No one else would be able to grab something from her so easily.\nArnold glared at the wine. \u201cYou don\u2019t need to drink this. I\u2019ll get rid of it.\u201d\n\u201cHey, give that back! They ruined a perfectly good glass of wine because of me. I\u2019m not going to waste it.\u201d She grabbed it back and took another sip, shuddering at the taste.\nArnold glowered. \u201cTell me who did this. I\u2019ll have them executed.\u201d\n\u201cDon\u2019t be ridiculous. You don\u2019t kill people like her\u2014you use them.\u201d Just the tiniest bit of wine to go, but it was getting harder to make herself drink it. She gave the glass a reproachful look, then glanced back at Arnold. \u201cOh, and I owe you an apology.\u201d\n\u201cDo you?\u201d\n\u201cI used your name to defend myself.\u201d The girls had only backed off when she threatened to tattle to Arnold. Rishe found that sort of thing inelegant in the extreme, and she was embarrassed.\nArnold sighed at Rishe\u2019s apologetic bow. \u201cThere\u2019s nothing wrong with a wife invoking her husband\u2019s name.\u201d\nRishe hesitated. \u201cWe\u2019re not married yet.\u201d\n\u201cThat\u2019s a formality. It\u2019s as good as done, if you ask me.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2026see.\u201d\nHe took her distraction as an opportunity to swipe her glass back. Instead of dumping it out, Arnold gulped the rest of it down. \n\u201cDamn, that packs a punch,\u201d he grumbled.\n\u201cI told you that!\u201d Rishe snapped. \u201cAre you all right? Let me get you some water!\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m fine. But now you\u2019ve fulfilled your obligation to the wine, haven\u2019t you?\u201d\nRishe didn\u2019t know what to say. He\u2019d helped her\u2014not by taking charge but by following her lead. Without cutting her down and telling her she was being foolish. Without rolling his eyes and dismissing her desires as trifles.\n\u201cThank you,\u201d Rishe said stiffly, which just made him laugh.\n\u201cWhat were you thinking about when we were dancing?\u201d he asked.\n\u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d\n\u201cYou were thinking about someone else, weren\u2019t you? Who?\u201d\nRishe didn\u2019t know a delicate way to say I was thinking about a future version of you I met in another life.\n\u201cHmm?\u201d His tone was oddly light, teasing even. But the gleam in his hunter\u2019s eyes said she wouldn\u2019t get away so easily.\nObviously, Rishe couldn\u2019t give him an honest answer. \u201cI wasn\u2019t thinking about anyone else. I was worried about you.\u201d\n\u201cWhy?\u201d\nThis was the closest she could come to the truth. \u201cWere you injured here?\u201d She patted her own left shoulder with her forefinger. \nArnold went silent. His left shoulder was slightly slower to react than his right\u2014if his right was at one hundred, then his left was at maybe ninety-eight. It was hardly noticeable, but Rishe had picked up on it. He was right-handed, and she wouldn\u2019t have noticed it if they\u2019d been dancing normally. \nThat, and if it hadn\u2019t been for memories from her past life.\nRishe had only managed to inflict a single injury on him. An instant, a moment\u2019s hesitation where she saw her chance and slashed left. Of course, he\u2019d shrugged off the injury and effortlessly run her through. \n\u201cHeh.\u201d Arnold finally broke his silence with grim laughter. His eyes sent shivers down her spine, cold and bewitching. In lieu of an answer, he reached for his collar, unfastening the clasp with a snap and drawing his jacket open with a rough tug.\nOh my.\nRishe drew in a breath. A great scar was engraved into the nape of his neck, just low enough to be concealed by clothing. It looked several years old. \u201cIt\u2019s an old wound. It continues to the top of my shoulder and pulls the skin taut.\u201d\n\u201cHow awful.\u201d Rishe couldn\u2019t help but reach out to gingerly touch the nape of his neck.\nArnold accepted her touch without a word. She\u2019d half expected to be slapped aside.\nHer fingers slowly traced the shape of it. She could feel the rough skin through her gloves.\nHe must have gotten this over a decade ago. Someone stabbed him\u2014and not just once or twice. They must have done it over and over to make this scar pattern.\nHer medical training had her shuddering at the image of a nine-year-old Arnold ashen and trembling with blood loss. The fact that he\u2019d survived and retained the use of his arm was incredible. And then to go on to wield a sword so skillfully\u2014his suffering must have been immense.\n\u201cOnly a few people know about this injury. You\u2019re the first to notice on your own.\u201d\n\u201cHow did it happen?\u201d\n",
    "query_text": "That grim smile returned as he looked down at Rishe. With the moon hanging behind him, he was as opaque as ever, but Rishe understood the sentiment.\nI shouldn\u2019t pry.\nRishe pulled her hand away, and that ominous smile that sent chills down her spine"

Rishe understood why.\nEverything Diana said was familiar to them. They spent valuable time searching for their materials and the proper ways to use them, but they shrank from asking for help. Everyone always looked so busy. This was a universal problem.\n\u201cDespite all that, I got better!\u201d Diana protested. \u201cI only needed to be taught once. Unlike them! They\u2019re useless!\u201d\n\u201cYes, well. There\u2019s a difference between you and them,\u201d Rishe told Diana. \u201cYou can read and write.\u201d\n\u201cOh!\u201d Diana started in surprise. Elsie looked at the floor.\nThe literacy rate among commoners was low no matter where you went. Very few families had the means to afford an education, especially for daughters. Diana had been born to a merchant\u2019s family\u2014she\u2019d received formal schooling. The maids she was close friends with were likely from similar backgrounds. The majority of those in service were not so fortunate.\n\u201cWhat if you only received instructions on how to do a job once and weren\u2019t able to write it down to remind yourself later?\u201d Rishe asked. \u201cWould you be so confident?\u201d\n\u201cI-I don\u2019t\u2014\u201d Diana reflexively thrust a hand into her apron pocket, where she had a list of daily tasks recorded in her neat handwriting to reference throughout the day. Hopefully now she would understand how much of an edge her privileged literacy gave her over the other maids.\n\u201cEveryone else works as hard as they can, just like you do,\u201d Rishe said. \u201cRemember how it was for you at first? They all have to start somewhere. I hope you\u2019ll keep that in mind.\u201d\n\u201cThey\u2019re no different from me,\u201d Diana mumbled begrudgingly, glancing around the room, looking at the less experienced maids. As if coming to a decision, she said, \u201cI\u2019m sorry.\u201d\n\u201cDiana?\u201d\nLike a child enumerating her regrets, Diana went on, \u201cI\u2019ve done you wrong, all of you. It\u2019s just, I had nothing. Or so it felt like. No money, no title. I thought I had to make my way in the world on my own. That I had to start from zero.\u201d Her shoulders trembled as she buried her face in her hands. \u201cBut I was wrong! I wasn\u2019t starting from zero. I had everything that I learned growing up. I didn\u2019t realize how fortunate I was. I let it all go to my he\n \n\u201cRISHE IRMGARD WEITZNER! You are a vile woman! A truly malicious creature unworthy of the crown prince! As of this instant, our engagement is off!\u201d \n\u201cAs you wish, Your Highness.\u201d\n\u201c\u2026Huh?\u201d\nThe prince\u2019s declaration echoed throughout the ballroom. Rishe, the duke\u2019s daughter, bowed in response, her coral-toned hair swaying gracefully. The assembled guests found themselves captivated by her dignified beauty. Despite having just witnessed a broken engagement, they couldn\u2019t bring themselves to pity her.\nSlowly, Rishe lifted her head and fixed the prince with a pale-emerald gaze. It caught him off guard, but he quickly recovered.\n\u201cDidn\u2019t you hear what I just said?! I\u2019m calling off our engagement! Doesn\u2019t that trouble you?\u201d\n\u201cNot really.\u201d\nRishe already knew what happened next: false accusations, exile, and her family severing all ties and leaving her to survive on her own. She turned from the prince. There was no point wasting any time.\nThis is my seventh loop, after all.\nRishe had done this all before.\nThe next few hours will be busy. I must hurry and retrieve my things before I\u2019m barred from the family estate. I don\u2019t want this to be one of the times I\u2019m too slow and I have to start my new life with nothing.\n\u201cRishe, halt and hear me! I have spent the past week perfecting my recitation of your crimes!\u201d\nI should take more than dresses this time\u2014there\u2019s plenty of things I could use out in the world. What trade should I take up? In my first life, I was a merchant. In my second, an apothecary. I\u2019ve got a few more I want to try out\u2026 Augh! If time\u2019s just going to keep resetting, I wish I could start at an earlier point. I need more time to prepare!\n\u201cWait! Rishe!\u201d\nThe crown prince was on the verge of tears, and the spectators struggled to suppress their snickers. \nA thought occurred to Rishe, and she stopped. She then turned, her eyes gleaming beneath long lashes as she stared down her ex-fianc\u00e9. \u201cAh, Your Highness, I almost forgot.\u201d \n\u201cYes, tell me!\u201d the prince fumed. \u201cLet me guess, you are hurt beyond measure and yet love me still\u2026correct?\u201d\nAs if. Rishe was grateful to be granted her freedom. In fact, she was smiling as she said, \u201cI hope you and Lady Mary are happy together.\u201d\n\u201cWhat?!\u201d\n\u201cMay we both lead fulfilling lives. Farewell!\u201d Rishe lifted the skirts of her evening gown and turned on her heel, departing as briskly as she could.\n\u201cHow do you know about Mary? I haven\u2019t told you I love her!\u201d The prince was shouting something behind her, but she paid him no mind. She had things to do.\nDuring her first loop, the prince\u2019s accusations had shocked her to the core and she\u2014foolishly so\u2014had attempted to defend herself. Now she knew better than to expect the prince to behave reasonably. \nHow will life unfold this time? I\u2019m excited to find out! Rishe fixed her mind on the future.\nThis is my seventh \u201cdo-over.\u201d I\u2019ve led happy and carefree lives before, but this time\u2014this time, I swear I\u2019ll live a long happy and carefree life!\nIn other words, she needed to avoid getting killed. At any cost. \n \n***\n \nIn the first loop, with her engagement broken and her reputation in tatters, Rishe roamed with nothing but the clothes on jewelry. Finding them a good-natured band, she hitched a ride to a neighboring country.\nFrom the merchant caravan, she learned a trade, studying how to procure stock and balance ledgers. Eventually, she set out on her own to travel the world. Her upbringing as a daughter of the nobility meant that, even at fifteen years old, Rishe possessed a keen sense for beauty.\nShe collected things that caught her eye and sold them to whoever found delight in her wares. Before she realized it, she had become a major vendor, employing a full staff. She had even done business with the king of a desert nation and the prince of a frozen country up north. She traveled to many distant places, realizing a dream born from her cossetted former life spent doing nothing but preparing to be queen.\nFive years passed, and just as she had only one country left to visit, Rishe fell victim to the war sweeping across the continent.\nThe next thing she knew, she was fifteen years old again and back at that party, with the prince poised to make his pronouncement.\n\u201cRishe Irmgard Weitzner! You are a vile woman! A truly malicious creature unworthy of the crown prince! As of this instant, our engagement is off!\u201d\nNaturally, she didn\u2019t understand what was going on at first. She looked around. Everything was the same. She stood in the same place wearing the same dress and draped in the same jewelry she\u2019d sold to the caravan.\nWas it a dream? Or was everything that had happened up until then the dream? In her confusion, all she could do was stare.\nRishe hurried out of the ballroom, the impending threat of exile hanging over her and the prince\u2019s entreaties to halt ringing in her ears.\nThis is perfect! Now I can get it right! I\u2019ll grab everything valuable from my room.\nRishe had enjoyed her life as a merchant, but she had always felt a stirring of regret about this night. If only she\u2019d brought some funds from home, she would\u2019ve had the capital to establish her business much sooner!\nSpeaking of this regret always prompted disbelief from her customers, including the king of the desert. \u201cWhat? That\u2019s what you\u2019d want to do over?!\u201d\nWhen she arrived back at home on the night of her second life, Rishe grabbed her jewelry box and as many of the books her late grandmother had left her as she could carry, then made haste to the forest to meet the caravan. But the stop at her house took time, and she missed them completely.\nIn that moment, Rishe made a stark realization. Different choices meant different mistakes. Opening one door would close another.\nAnd so the easy path to a life in commerce was closed to her.\nSure, she could try to build her business from the ground up, but personal connections were almost as essential to being a merchant as business savvy. It just wasn\u2019t realistic without a single acquaintance. \nSorting through her belongings in resignation, she came across a foreign encyclopedia of herbs among her grandmother\u2019s books. Taking it as a sign, Rishe sold her jewels elsewhere and used the funds to cross the sea and pursue the study of medicine.\nFortunately, Rishe retained all her knowledge from her previous life. She remembered that certain expensive herbs could be acquired cheaply in other regions. When word spread of a disease running rampant in a neighboring country, she recalled that too. This foreknowledge proved invaluable, as did her wide travel and exposure to many different teachers with many different points of view.\nAs such, Rishe led a successful life as an apothecary. She saved a feeble prince, synthesized a number of rare medicines with her mercantile knowledge, and thus spent her days in the simple joy of helping those in need.\nUnfortunately, all the joy in the world couldn\u2019t stand up to an epidemic. Thus ended her second life. \nOnce again, she found herself in the moment of her broken engagement, the curtain rising on the third loop. Her next four lives proceeded much the same way. As a skilled lady\u2019s maid, she helped a young noblewoman to a fortuitous marriage. Once, she even disguised herself as a man and became a knight. Every life was worth living, and she enjoyed them all. She enjoyed living, period.\nThere was just one problem.\nNo matter what I do, I die at twenty.\nShe enjoyed her lives, but she was not permitted to do so for long. With this time limit always hanging over her, she spent each loop in a state of constant activity.\nI would love to take it easy for a while. Is a little leisure time too much to ask? Obviously I don\u2019t want to die either! This time, I\u2019ll make as much money as I can in the first five years. Then, when I turn twenty, I\u2019ll live a life free of worldly cares. I\u2019ll do whatever\u2019s necessary to stay alive!\nHer mind made up, Rishe began her seventh life in a dead sprint through the palace. Regardless of her future plans, she was in a race against time. She needed to beat the messenger bearing news of her scandal.\nAs she ran, she yanked off her hair ornaments; she planned to sell them and didn\u2019t want to risk losing one. Her hair billowed out behind her, falling in loose waves.\nSuddenly, an idea occurred to her, one she hadn\u2019t had in any of her previous six lives.\nLeaving through the palace gardens would be faster. I can climb down a tree from the balcony.\nRishe had gone to war as a knight in the life just before this one. After the punishing battlefield training, climbing trees was nothing.\nSeamlessly, she changed direction. She raced for the balcony, where she ran into something at full speed.\n\u201cBwargh!\u201d Rishe let out a very unladylike grunt, staggering a few steps. She looked up to see what she\u2019d bounced off of. \u201cOh\u2026\u201d\nAn exceptionally handsome man stood in her path.\nHe had refined, patrician features and cruel, thin lips. He was slender yet powerful; even through his clothes, Rishe could tell his body was well conditioned. His jet-black hair covered his ears, creeping down to the nape of his neck. The tips of his locks bounced with his movements. They looked to be soft to the touch.\nFrom head to toe, he was a pleasure to look at\u2014but what held Rishe\u2019s attention were his eyes. They were long in shape and impossibly blue, but they possessed a blade-sharp intensity. His gaze was clear, beautiful, and cold as ice. His eyelashes cast shadows on his striking face. He was a work of art.\nCurrently, this work of art was staring her down with a look that could kill.\nHe laughed. \u201cYou barreled right into me. For a moment, I thought I\u2019d been attacked by a wild boar.\u201d\nIt was an exceedingly rude thing to say to a stranger, but as luck would have it, this man was not a stranger. At least not to Rishe.\n\u201cWhat are you even doing here?\u201d the man went on. \u201cThe party is in the\u2014\u201d\nRishe interrupted him with a wordless shout of dismay. The man drew back, reflexively reaching for his sword. He composed himself with visible difficulty. \u201cWho are you? You look like any noblewoman, but your manner is\u2026\u201d \n\u201cEmperor Arnold Hein!\u201d \nThe man\u2019s eyes widened. He didn\u2019t mistake her surging contempt. Rishe had crossed swords with this man. Recently. He was the one responsible for ending her sixth life. \nHe must be a guest at the banquet. It makes sense.\nArnold Hein was the scion of a military nation not far from Rishe\u2019s home country of Hermity, the one in which they now stood. Their kingdoms, so recently at war, had brokered an ostensible peace, and the two ruling families met from time to time. Crown Prince Dietrich\u2019s engagement party would be one such occasion. He\u2019d gathered elites from far and wide to introduce to his beloved Mary.\nThe man eyed Rishe with rising curiosity. \u201cYou know me? This is my first time in Hermity.\u201d\nUh-oh. Rishe pasted on a smile as her mind spun in circles. This man was dangerous. She had to avoid entanglements with him at all costs. Five years from now, Arnold Hein would invade Hermity. \nHe was an extraordinarily skilled swordsman and, with a powerful military at his back, was destined to conquer kingdom after kingdom. He had done as much in her second, third, fourth, and fifth lives. In her sixth, Rishe had faced him in battle herself and died by his hand.\nWe never had a chance. That war was lost before it began.\nArnold\u2019s brilliance lay not in his swordplay but in his skill as a tactician. He set countries up for conquest and knocked them down, swallowing them one by one.\nI know him, but he doesn\u2019t know me. We haven\u2019t met in this life. I need an excuse fast. \nRishe curtsied slowly. \u201cMy name is Rishe Irmgard Weitzner. We\u2019ve never been introduced, but I\u2019ve heard of you.\u201d\nArnold donned an amused smile. \u201cYou plant your weight like a trained swordswoman. Your center of gravity is perfect.\u201d\n\u201cYou exaggerate,\u201d Rishe demurred. \u201cThat was simply a curtsy to an esteemed guest.\u201d \n\u201cI must have misheard, but I swear you called me \u2018emperor\u2019 just now.\u201d \nRishe froze.\n\u201cMy father yet lives,\u201d Arnold said. \u201cI am simply a crown prince. Why would you call me that?\u201d \n\u201cUh, um\u2026\u201d Rishe floundered for an answer.\nShe\u2019d made such a foolish mistake. Arnold\u2019s gaze cut right through her. It felt like he\u2019d see through any lie she told right down to her soul. She remembered this from the battlefield\u2014how his attention alone felt like a sword thrust.\nBut why even bother to lie? They\u2019d never meet again, so who cared what he thought of her? Sure, she harbored a hard feeling or two over the recent slaying, but there was no point complaining about it to this Arnold. Calling him the emperor was boorish, but Rishe was in the process of being forcibly exiled. Why play at diplomacy?\nShe took a deep breath and bowed low. This was not the curtsy of a noble lady but of a servant bowing in supplication to her master.\n\u201cMy humblest apologies, Your Highness. I was in a rush. Such a rude slip of the tongue.\u201d She raised her head. \u201cMy ex-fianc\u00e9 just annulled our engagement, so I\u2019ve got a lot on my mind. If you would excuse me.\u201d \n\u201cHe annulled your engagement?\u201d\nAt that, Rishe turned and fled.\nThis unexpected run-in with Arnold had taken up valuable time. She threw open the door to the balcony and hiked up her skirts, kicking off her shoes in anticipation of jumping into a tree. Looking down, she realized the ground was far closer than she\u2019d feared.\nExcellent! I can just drop into the garden!\nArnold, who up until now had been rendered speechless, shook himself out of his fugue as Rishe clambered over the railing. \u201cHey!\u201d\nRishe\u2019s moonlight-silver dress flowed around her as she leapt. The lawn was soft, but the fall was still far enough to risk injury.\nWeight evenly distributed on the soles of my feet, roll to transfer the impact to my shins and thighs, then onto my hips and my back.\nShe landed safely, rolled nimbly in her dress, and popped back up. Her hair was covered in leaves. \nI need to hurry up!\nBracing against a nearby rock, she used her weight to snap the heels off of her shoes. There. That would make running a little easier. Satisfied, she slipped them back on and made haste toward the family estate. \n \n***\n \nUp",

She filled a bucket with water and went to work, rolling up a handkerchief to cover her mouth as she swept dust down from high on the walls. Then she"

    "prefix_text": " \u201cD-don\u2019t laugh at me!\u201d\n\u201cLady Rishe,\u201d came a sweet voice. \u201cAren\u2019t you ashamed of yourself?\u201d \nRishe fought down a groan.\nOut of the crowd stepped a charming, dainty girl. Her big eyes moist with tears, she took her place at Dietrich\u2019s side. \u201cI do not allow the people I care about to be treated so very ill!\u201d \n\u201cWhy, Lady Mary. You\u2019re here.\u201d Rishe sighed. \u201cHow nice.\u201d\nThe young Mary scowled through her tears. Hidden behind her skirts, Dietrich continued to shout his disapproval. \u201cRishe! You\u2019ve brought my beloved Mary to tears! She\u2019s told me everything. How you bullied her, ridiculed her. How you find it amusing to lock her in the classroom overnight! Such a wicked woman could never be queen!\u201d\nNone of that\u2019s true.\nRishe glanced at Mary, who averted her gaze a little awkwardly.\n\u201cMore importantly,\u201d Rishe said, \u201chave you already brought your concerns to my parents, Your Highness?\u201d\n\u201cMore importantly?! I did, if you must know! Your parents are furious. They have vowed to disown you.\u201d\n\u201cAh. Then I\u2019m too late.\u201d Her parents held their reputation above all else. Rishe had little hope of retrieving any of her money or belongings now.\n\u201cWhy are you acting so strangely?\u201d Dietrich sniffed. \u201cAh, I understand. You\u2019re in such shock from this turn of events that\u2014\u201d\n\u201cListen, Dietrich.\u201d In her exasperation, Rishe dropped his title. \u201cI accept your decree. We are no longer engaged. I shall never darken your doorstep again. So\u2026relax a little.\u201d\n\u201cHuh? What are you saying?\u201d\n\u201cSince I was a child, I believed that my only value was in our betrothal. Being engaged to the crown prince was my whole reason for living. I was wrong about that. Only I determine my value\u2014no one else. That\u2019s why I don\u2019t care about this. I\u2019m beyond it.\u201d Rishe made sure to look him directly in the eye as she spoke. \u201cYou are an unnecessary element in my life.\u201d\nDietrich staggered back. His legs seemed to go out from under him, and he crumpled. At that, the knights finally let go of their composure, laughing along with the courtiers.\n\u201cSt-stop!\u201d the prince wailed. \u201cYou are my subjects. This\u2026this shows such flagrant disrespect!\u201d\n\u201cDietrich, don\u2019t pay them any mind,\u201d Lady Mary said. \u201cLady Rishe, is this cruelty necessary?\u201d\n\u201cPerhaps this is a blessing in disguise.\u201d Rishe\u2019s attention moved to Mary, making the girl\u2019s slender shoulders jump. She had no reason to worry; Rishe didn\u2019t bite. \u201cI\u2019ve been wanting the opportunity to speak to you, Lady Mary. You\u2019re strong. I admire you very much.\u201d\n\u201cWhat are you talking about?\u201d\n\u201cYou\u2019re a lovely girl who never fails to smile despite your troubles. You don\u2019t put up walls around your heart, and you do your utmost to put others at ease. Even now, you bravely stand before me to protect the prince.\u201d\nMary\u2019s eyes were wide with confusion. Rishe picked her words carefully, attempting to diminish the girl\u2019s guilty feelings, if only a little. \u201cYou need to marry the prince for your family\u2019s sake, right?\u201d\n\u201cHow do you\u2014?\u201d\nRishe had learned this truth in one of her past lives. Mary was born to a poor family, and she had studied like mad to be accepted into the academy to hunt for a husband. She intended to make sure neither she nor her brothers ever went hungry again.\nShe went on, \u201cRemember this: you are the one in control of your life. Don\u2019t sell it to anyone else. Can you trust a man who so easily discards the woman he\u2019s been engaged to since childhood? Do you truly believe he cares for you?\u201d\nAstonishment bloomed across Mary\u2019s face. She looked over at Dietrich, who hadn\u2019t bothered to stand up. The truth was\u2026within a year, Prince Dietrich would be in prison, his title stripped from him. He would plan a mad coup d\u2019\u00e9tat against the king, attempting to provoke the citizens to war. His plan would be discovered in its early stages, rendering him a laughingstock across the kingdom.\n\u201cYou must shape your future with your own hands\u2014you mustn\u2019t entrust your desires to others.\u201d \n\u201cMy\u2026my desires?\nRishe nodded.\nMary was looking at her like she was speaking a foreign language. \u201cBut I\u2019m their elder sister.\u201d Her voice quivered. \u201cI must endure, no matter what. Otherwise, my brothers will never be happy.\u201d\n\u201cAnd you believe their happiness can only be achieved by sacrificing your own?\u201d\nMary gasped as she gaped at Rishe.\n\u201cYou don\u2019t need to throw away your own future to protect those you love,\u201d Rishe told her. \u201cNo matter what path you choose, never forget that.\u201d\n\u201cMy future?\u201d Mary\u2019s voice went ragged, like she was barely suppressing a wail of pain.\n\u201cI wish you a life where both you and your family can be happy,\u201d said Rishe.\nMary stood frozen in place, eyes gleaming like precious stones. Rishe couldn\u2019t help but admire how pretty she was. She truly did wish her happiness. But right now, she needed to take care of herself. \n\u201cWell.\u201d Rishe suddenly broke into a smile, making Dietrich flinch. \u201cI think it\u2019s time for me to be on my way.\u201d\nShe regretted losing access to her room, but she knew her parents wouldn\u2019t let her in. Turning her back on the crowd, Rishe contemplated her next move.\n\u201cWait, Lady Rishe!\u201d Mary\u2019s voice rang out.\n\u201cThat\u2019s right. You\u2019re not going anywhere, Rishe!\u201d The prince joined her. \u201cYou won\u2019t get away with treating me like trash to relieve your own injured heart.\u201d\n\u201cUgh, enough already!\u201d Rishe\u2019s patience was fraying. \u201cI don\u2019t have anything else to say to you. Goodbye!\u201d\n\u201cKnights, stop her!\u201d\nReluctantly, the knights moved to tail Rishe as she walked briskly back down the path. She sympathized with them, but she wasn\u2019t about to let them keep her here. Rounding a corner, she sensed something uncanny. She stopped, the knights quickly catching up with her.\n\u201cMy apologies, Lady Rishe. If you could please remain for just a\u2014whoa!\u201d\nRishe grabbed the hilt of the knight\u2019s sword. Yanking it from his belt, she spun around and stood at the ready. Metal rang against metal as Rishe parried a blow. She glared at her would-be attacker as he stepped out of the shadows.\nArnold Hein!\n\u201cWell, what do you know.\u201d The man smiling so sweetly while their swords locked was the very man who had ended her life. \u201cYou do have some skill.\u201d\nMetal screeched and slid, before Arnold sheathed his sword. Rishe lowered hers. Neither looked away.\n\u201cWho the hell are you?\u201d demanded one of the knights.\n\u201cStand down, good sirs,\u201d Rishe said. \u201cYour interference will only make this worse.\u201d\nThis mostly served to befuddle the knights further. Rishe absolutely couldn\u2019t allow them to come to blows with the crown prince of a friendly nation. And they couldn\u2019t beat him\u2014not even if they took him all at once. Rishe had blocked his blow, but her arm was completely numb. To think he\u2019d be even more powerful in five years.\nHe regarded her unabashedly. \u201cRishe, was that your name? Where did you learn such swordsmanship?\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m afraid I cannot say. Besides, you were clearly going easy on me.\u201d\n\u201cHa! You could tell?\u201d\nArnold\u2019s manner was throwing her off. He seemed to be enjoying himself. He\u2019s laughing. This monstrous prince is\u2026actually laughing.\nWhen she had met him in her other life, he was cold and merciless, like a genuine monster. And yet here he stood, mellow and smiling.\nThe Emperor Arnold Hein I knew was twenty-four years old, so he\u2019s, what? Nineteen now? This is so weird. He\u2019s grinning like a boy getting into a scrape.\nThat attack had been good-natured as well, almost playful. It had muscle behind it but certainly not any lethal intent. He\u2019d just wanted to force Rishe to catch the blow. She found it unbelievable that he could exude such an overpowering air of menace when he was just messing around.\nWhile Rishe was focused on Arnold, Mary and Dietrich caught up, seemingly recovered.\n\u201cExcuse me, my lord!\u201d Mary squeaked. \u201cI-I-I don\u2019t know who you are, but kindly step away from Lady Rishe!\u201d\n\u201cYes, do as she says! Who the hell are you, anyway?!\u201d\nDon\u2019t tell me Prince Dietrich doesn\u2019t recognize one of his personal guests.\nDietrich\u2019s interests did not lean toward diplomacy; he likely hadn\u2019t bothered to introduce himself to Arnold. Mary, for her part, seemed to grasp that Arnold wasn\u2019t ordinary. She stood up to defend Rishe, despite the tremble in her voice. In a better world, perhaps the two of them could have become friends.\n\u201cThat\u2019s your ex-fianc\u00e9?\u201d Arnold cocked a brow. \u201cHe\u2019s even worse than I imagined. Pathetic.\u201d\nDietrich flushed. \u201cI\u2019ll have your head!\u201d\n\u201cDietrich, I beg of you, contain yourself,\u201d Rishe said, then rounded on Arnold. \u201cAs for you, Your Highness\u2014you know who Dietrich is, and you know what speaking carelessly could mean. Are you trying to pick a fight?\u201d\n\u201cWhatever do you mean?\u201d Arnold\u2019s brows lifted high, making him the picture of innocence. \u201cBelieve me, Lady Rishe, every word I speak is chosen with extreme care.\u201d\nFinally realizing who Arnold was, Dietrich visibly paled. \u201cArnold? He\u2019s the crown prince of Galkhein?\u201d\nMary yelped. The knights stood down, shamefaced. The gossip-hungry neighbors who\u2019d gathered to witness a scandal play out drew back in fear.\n\u201cHe\u2019s the demon prince? The one who single-handedly destroyed a whole order of enemy knights?\u201d\n\u201cWatch your tongue, fool! Do you want him to do the same to you?\u201d\nThe two nations enjoyed peaceful relations, but Arnold remained the dreaded prince, heir to the throne of a former enemy. Current rumor wasn\u2019t as widespread as it would be in five years, but he was still regarded with distrust.\nThe onlookers stood rooted to the spot, too terrified to flee.\nWell, this has devolved into a full-fledged disaster.\nRishe heaved a frustrated sigh. \u201cPrince Arnold, to what do we owe this honor? Surely a crown prince would not draw his sword for a mere jest.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m here on business,\u201d Arnold said. \u201cBut first, I must beg forgiveness for my rudeness.\u201d\nHuh, what do you know? Once he became emperor, he\u2019d gladly behead any subject who so much as dared speak a word against him.\nI guess at nineteen he still knew how to apologize.\nIf that surprised her, Arnold\u2019s next act completely obliterated her sense of reality. \nWith a flourish, he fell to his knees. \n\u201cHuh?\u201d Is this actually happening? \nHe was a man destined for an imperial crown. A man who would stand at the head of a military powerhouse and spread his rule across continents.\nArnold, known for his frigid pride, knelt to the disgraced daughter of a duke.\nAnd not only that\u2014his head was bowed, looking nothing so much as a knight swearing allegiance to his lady. If it were anyone else, it would be a delightful, pious image. Instead, the assembled looked on in terrified awe.\nNot Rishe, though.\n\u201cWhat are you doing?\u201d she hissed. \u201cGet up!\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m apologizing for my baseless impertinence. Also, I\u2019m asking you\u2026\u201d He trailed off to take Rishe\u2019s hand, tugging her forward so forcefully she staggered. He gazed up at her.\nUgh. He\u2019s so beautiful. No matter how many times she looked at him, it didn\u2019t become any less disarming. Long eyelashes, arched brows, a noble nose. His bright blue eyes reminded her of the drift ice she\u2019d seen in a northern kingdom, gazing out from a ship in one of her past lives. She knew she was dwelling on this to buy time, even as the reality before her sank in.\n\u201c\u2026to become my wife.\u201d\nShe froze, unable to process the words. \u201cWhat?\u201d Rishe glanced around, desperately searching the faces of the crowd. They all seemed as stunned as she felt. She looked down at Arnold again. \u201cYour wife?\u201d \n\u201cYes, that\u2019s right.\u201d\n\u201cYou want me to become your wife?\u201d\n\u201cYes.\u201d\nRishe couldn\u2019t speak. This was truly happening. It was real. It clicked into place in her head, and she let out a strangled grunt.\nWhat is going on? Why is this happening?\nShock lapped at her, fuzzing at the corners of her vision. He wanted to marry her. Arnold wanted to marry Rishe. Her murderer wanted to marry her.\nWhy is he doing this? He must have some ulterior motive, a broader goal. But I have to give him an answer.\nThe onlookers were holding their breath as Rishe said flatly, \u201cI reject your proposal.\u201d\nArnold said nothing.\nShe had to reject him. She was going to live a long, peaceful, carefree life, damn it, and no one would stop her. And yet\u2026\nArnold began to laugh, and the deep, creeping sense of dread inside Rishe only grew. Why does he seem so amused by this?!\n \n***\n \nHer previous life was her sixth. Disguised as a man, Rishe rose as a warrior of an island country she came upon in her travels. It was a conventional yet charming kingdom formed of red brick. After striking up a friendship with a group of knights who didn\u2019t realize she was a woman, Rishe followed their advice and joined them.\nThe training was grueling enough to make her wish she were dead. Back when she had lived as a noble, she\u2019d learned how to wield a sword for basic self-defense, but training as a noble lady had in no way prepared her for this. She drilled relentlessly, barely taking the time to sleep. Just as she became a full-fledged knight, Emperor Arnold\u2019s forces lay siege to the castle.\n \n***\n \nHow could this happen? \nIn her seventh life, Rishe wearily sank into her chair. Across from her sat Arnold, his legs crossed and chin propped up on his hand, watching her lazily.\n\u201cWhat\u2019s the matter?\u201d he asked. \u201cYou seem unhappy.\u201d\n\u201cYou could say that.\u201d Even her voice was grumpy. Still, she couldn\u2019t very well tell him it was because she bore a grudge from a previous life. After the first time her life rewound to that pivotal moment, she\u2019d resolved to keep her loops a secret. \u201cI had plans for my exile. A brand-new life. And now because of you, my parents are involved. Even the king has heard about it!\u201d\nAfter Rishe rejected Arnold, Dietrich had immediately cried out, \u201cTh-the crown prince of Galkhein proposed to Rishe?!\u201d\nHis shrieks were loud enough to attract the attention of the master and mistress of the manor.\nWhen her parents came out, Rishe had protested, \u201cI\u2019m not going to marry him! I\u2019m leaving the country just as Dietrich commanded.\u201d\nNo one listened. Their faces just paled with nervous confusion.\nJust then, a glittering coach arrived. Half-stuck in the mud, the man inside it was forced to trudge over the swampy ground, and so the king of Hermity himself arrived, staggering and dirt-stained. \nHe grabbed hold of his son\u2019s collar, pushing him into a low bow. He then turned to Prince Arnold and said, rather loudly, \u201cYour Highness! Allow me to apologize for my son\u2019s foolishness! You are an esteemed guest all the way from Galkhein! It is unthinkable he would not offer you the courtesy you are due!\u201d\n\u201cYou\u2019re hurting me, Father! My back!\u201d\nThe king then turned to Rishe. \u201cMy lady, allow me to sincerely apologize as both a king and a father. My son\u2019s behavior toward you has been utterly disgraceful. I beg you to please give Prince Arnold\u2019s proposal due consideration. Not only for your own sake but for the sake of your country.\u201d\nThe king bowed to her",
    "query_text": " as deeply as his son had to Arnold, and her parents joined him. Rishe felt dizzy at the sight of this abject debasement in the presence of citizens.\nArnold, who had been watching the proceedings with a detached amusement, sobered and stepped toward the king. \u201cYour Majesty, please rise.\u201d\nWithout the smirk, Arnold\u2019s face immediately reverted to its cold mask. The king didn\u2019t move. Maybe something in Arnold\u2019s voice kept him frozen.\n\u201cSuch a trifle won\u2019t cause discord between our kingdoms,\u201d he went on. \u201cHowever, I would beg a little time to speak with Lady Rishe.\u201d\nLater, Rishe would learn that Arnold\u2019s attendant had spoken to the king\u2019s own"

    "prefix_text": "?\u201d her friend said. He was the ruler of the desert kingdom, and his smile was awfully charming. \u201cWhat\u2019s that?\u201d\nRishe smiled back. \u201cI want to travel to every single country in the world. I want to see everything in every town, peruse their markets, and meet the eyes of every person who lives there!\u201d\nBy now, that felt like such a distant dream.\n \n***\n \nRishe awoke with a start, eyes snapping open as she sensed a disturbance in the air.\nShe unsheathed her sword halfway, primed for danger. \nInside the coach, her old enemy sat across from her, one hand outstretched. \u201cWhat do you think you\u2019re doing?\u201d she demanded.\nWhen they\u2019d boarded the coach, Rishe had warned him not to lay a single finger on her throughout the trip to his kingdom. Ordering the prince not to touch his consort was absurd, but Arnold readily agreed. He had, after all, promised to follow her every direction.\nAnd yet, here he was, already breaking his promise.\nArnold appeared unperturbed by her glare. \u201cDon\u2019t look at me like that. I was merely trying to recover what you took from me.\u201d\nConfused, Rishe looked at the sword in her hand. It had a black lacquered scabbard with a simple golden decoration. Engraved on the hilt was the Galkhein crest.\n\u201cOh!\u201d Rishe thrust the sword back at Arnold. \u201cMy apologies.\u201d\nArnold chuckled. \u201cYou caught me off guard. You were nodding off, and then you suddenly snatched up my sword. You looked quite content snuggling up with it.\u201d\nArnold propped the sword beside him. Rishe pressed a hand to her chest to quell her racing heart. The sword that gutted me in my previous life is now my bedmate. What a world. Her recent stint as a knight had left her ill at ease without a blade at hand. She just couldn\u2019t believe it was Arnold\u2019s she\u2019d reached for.\n\u201cI didn\u2019t mean to disturb you, but I doubted sleeping with a weapon would be comfortable. I\u2019m impressed you sensed my intent before I even touched you.\u201d Arnold rested one elbow against the window frame, watching her with shameless fascination. \u201cOne only develops instincts like that from combat training. And you were also a member of the court? How in the world did you find the time?\u201d\nRishe shrugged. She couldn\u2019t just say, I pretended to be a man in a previous life, that\u2019s how.\n\u201cI assume there\u2019s more to you than your devotion to the sword. You seem to like flowers.\u201d\nShe followed Arnold\u2019s gaze to where she\u2019d bundled a small bouquet in a handkerchief. This was their fifth day on the road to Galkhein. Every day, without fail, she\u2019d picked flowers whenever they stopped to water the horses. The ones from today were still fresh, but the ones she\u2019d begun drying five days ago were just about ready.\n\u201cI didn\u2019t pick these because they\u2019re pretty.\u201d Rishe brought the blooms to her face, spirits rising at their sweet scent. Spring wildflowers had a soft and gentle smell. Rishe looked out the window at the forest spreading toward Galkhein, thinking of the rare native flowers going into bloom. She wished she could pick those as well, but that would cause too much delay. She gazed on wistfully.\nAfter watching her in silence for some time, Arnold said, \u201cBy the way, I sent one of my men ahead on a fast horse to deliver your order to the company you requested. They\u2019ll be invited to Galkhein to discuss the wedding ceremony.\u201d\n\u201cThank you,\u201d Rishe said. \u201cI\u2019m glad you kept your word.\u201d\n\u201cThe Aria Trading Company,\u201d Arnold mused. \u201cI\u2019ve heard of them. They\u2019re up-and-comers, aren\u2019t they? Have you done business with them before?\u201d\n\u201cNo, but I heard from a friend that they hold a very high standard of quality.\u201d\nRishe was pleasantly surprised at how easily Arnold had acceded to her request. Typically, a royal household had their own personal dealer. Getting them to do business with someone else could be difficult.\nI want to establish a connection with Aria as soon as possible, Rishe thought. It was, of course, the company that had taken her in during her first life.\nThe company had been established just two years prior to picking her up by its owner, a man named Tully. They were still in their growth stage, but in just a few years, they would be the grandest trading company in all the world. They\u2019d proven a great boon in her life as an apothecary as well, helping to distribute her newest medicines. She\u2019d struggled to win their trust initially, but she pledged to work much harder this time around.\nThis marriage isn\u2019t going to happen\u2014I need an escape plan for when it all falls apart. I must bring to bear all my knowledge and influence as a crown princess.\nRishe didn\u2019t know Arnold\u2019s plans, but she had no intention of sitting around and waiting for him to use her as he pleased. She\u2019d spend her time as his consort wisely. Everything must serve her ultimate goal: to live longer than five years, and live well.\nHer fierce determination must have shown on her face because Arnold gave her a little bemused smile. \u201cYes?\u201d\nGod! Rishe grimaced at that flawlessly handsome countenance. Such beauty, possessed by such powerful destruction. The fact that he\u2019d been the man to kill her did nothing to lessen her fascination. In fact, it almost made it worse. The study of contrasts.\n\u201cSorry, I just\u2014\u201d\nShe was interrupted by the horses\u2019 loud whinnies.\n\u201cStop! Hey, stop the coach!\u201d\nShouts drifted back from conveyance ahead of theirs, which contained the luggage and attendants. The squadron of knights tailing the column of coaches sped off toward the front.\n\u201cWho do you think you\u2014graaargh!\u201d\nThat didn\u2019t sound good. Rishe moved to climb out, but Arnold was faster. He drew his sword.\n\u201cHey!\u201d\nArnold locked the door from the outside. \u201cStay hidden.\u201d\nWhy is he putting himself in danger? That\u2019s what knights are for! The fact that Rishe had been about to do the same thing didn\u2019t occur to her. It\u2019s probably bandits. He told me to stay hidden in here, but I\u2019m not so sure about that.\nArnold had left her locked in from the outside, hoping to keep her safe, but Rishe didn\u2019t like her odds. There were five coaches, but this one was certainly the grandest. It locked on the inside as well, but that wouldn\u2019t stop someone with enough determination. If she did as she was told, she\u2019d just be waiting patiently for a bandit to break a window and drag her out.\nKeeping one eye on the coachmen fleeing into the forest, Rishe began a methodical search for something to help her. Right\u2014her hairpin!\nThis sure brings me back. She unfastened it, twisting it into the gap in the door. Back when I was a maid, my lady would lock herself in her chambers all the time to avoid her studies. I had to break her out just like this.\nThe lock on the coach was simple, and it came open easily. Once she was free, she scanned her surroundings. She didn\u2019t see anyone who looked immediately hostile, but there was noise up ahead. Cautiously, she headed toward it.\nBefore long, she found Arnold.\nWow.\nRoughly ten men\u2014the bandits, she presumed\u2014lay crumpled on the ground. In their midst stood Arnold, in the process of tripping another man into the dirt. He scowled, blade at the man\u2019s throat. \u201cIs that it, then?\u201d\n\u201cGwugh!\u201d\nArnold kicked the bandit in the stomach, eyes blazing with cruelty. \u201cThat\u2019s all the thrill you offer me after I went to the trouble of drawing my sword? Barely worth it. I\u2019m bored already.\u201d\nHe wasn\u2019t angry; on the contrary, he stared his enemies down with chilly disappointment, as if this had all been a letdown. Even Arnold\u2019s own knights seemed terrified of their master when he was in a mood. Arnold smoothly flicked the blood off his sword,",

    "prefix_text": " Then I can live my dream of being utterly useless.\u201d Rishe trembled with delight. The thought of acting as an ambassador had really been weighing on her mind. Being a princess was nonstop work. Having been groomed for the position from an early age, Rishe knew members of the royal family barely even had time to sleep.\nBut prisoners didn\u2019t have places in government.\n\u201cThis is such a weight off my mind,\u201d Rishe admitted. \u201cThank you so much for keeping your promise, Your Highness.\u201d\n\u201cEr, of course.\u201d\n\u201cBut don\u2019t worry, I won\u2019t shirk my duties as wedding planner.\u201d Nearly ready to collapse with relief, Rishe returned to her herbs.\n \n***\n \nAfter the bandit incident, Rishe felt the knights begin to ease a bit in her presence.\nDespite their initial reluctance to accept her help, they continued to report the injured men\u2019s progress and bring any concerns directly to her. In return, they took over gathering herbs from the surrounding countryside on their rest stops.\nShe hadn\u2019t done it for gratitude, but she was nonetheless touched. Gathering medicinal herbs had been second nature ever since her life as an apothecary, and it was foolish to ever turn down loyalty.\nSeveral days after the altercation with the bandits, the coach train finally arrived in the imperial capital of Galkhein.\n\u201cOh my,\u201d Rishe murmured as they passed through the gates.\nWhite stone buildings stood in straight rows, lining clean, orderly streets. The first stories all appeared to be shops, while the second-floor windows were festooned with flowers. Everywhere she looked were smiling faces, citizens turned out to witness their prince\u2019s return over the smooth brick roads. Overlooking it all was the towering magnificence of the imperial palace.\n\u201cThe capital is the seat of power in Galkhein,\u201d Arnold explained. \u201cSeveral key trade routes converge here.\u201d\nRishe nodded, suddenly anxious to be out of the coach. More and more people were gathering to watch their progress, some carrying shopping bags in both arms or holding hands with children. Many of them waved, as if greeting someone dear to them.\nHappy citizens and clean, orderly streets meant wealth. Galkhein was well-off. Rishe couldn\u2019t help but grin at an adorable little girl watching them roll by with sparkling eyes. When she saw Rishe\u2019s smile, she blushed and leapt up in the air, laughing with delight.\nThe coach made its way through the city before passing through the castle gates. Lines of disciplined knights flanked the road, ready to greet the crown prince and his fianc\u00e9e.\nArnold stepped out of the coach, holding out his hand to Rishe. She took it reflexively as she alighted. A prince would be expected to help any lady out of carriage, never mind his own consort, yet for some reason the knights looked a bit disturbed.\nRishe shot them back of look of innocent confusion.\n\u201cOur long journey is at last at its end, Your Highness, Lady Rishe.\u201d Oliver emerged from the ranks of the knights, bowing. He shot Arnold a curious glance. \u201cHow novel to see you taking the hand of your fianc\u00e9e.\u201d\nAh! Rishe realized that she herself had willingly broken the condition that she had imposed. Arnold had offered his hand, but she was the one who accepted.\nArnold gave a little laugh of triumph. Rishe felt a rush of frustration at being tricked. \nOliver stared at them before leaning in to whisper in Arnold\u2019s ear. Arnold let out a breath of annoyance. \n\u201cIs something the matter?\u201d Rishe asked.\n\u201cI sent orders ahead to have a detached wing of the palace prepared for us, but it seems the preparations are behind schedule. I\u2019m sorry, but you\u2019ll need to stay in a guest room in the main palace for a few days.\u201d\n\u201cOh, I don\u2019t mind if the wing isn\u2019t ready,\u201d Rishe said. \u201cWe can head over there now.\u201d\n\u201cIt hasn\u2019t been used in quite a while. It\u2019ll be covered in dust.\u201d\n\u201cI said that I didn\u2019t mind if it was a mess, remember? But there\u2019s no need for you to put yourself out. By all means, stay in the main palace for as long as you need.\u201d Rishe had spent a life as a maid\u2014dust didn\u2019t scare her. \u201cBesides, I\u2019m a hostage, after all.\u201d\n\u201cYou could at least attempt to sound distressed,\u201d Arnold said with the slightest trace of petulance. \nRishe, who had a huge grin spreading over her face and her chest puffed out with pride, didn\u2019t respond.\n \n***\n \nThe detached wing turned out to be just a separate palace in the distant corner of the grounds\u2014a scant four stories tall and, as advertised, absolutely swimming in dust.\nNot so bad, though. Rishe had pictured decay and clutter, but it was mostly just bare. Bare and musty, but not rotten or falling apart.\n\u201cYou can do whatever you want with this place. I\u2019ll be occupied over the next few days, but feel free to use the guest apartments in the main palace if you get tired of choking to death,\u201d Arnold said before he left.\nAccording to Oliver, work had piled up while the prince was away, and it wasn\u2019t just a few things that could be dispensed with over a few days working around the clock.\nEmperor Arnold Hein\u2026 He\u2019s just a crown prince right now, but I still wish I knew what\u2019s going on in his head. For now, I\u2019ll just focus on what I can do. Like make this place livable.\nShe changed into her plainest dress and rolled up her sleeves. The knights who\u2019d remained to serve as her guard kept watch over her as she went from window to window, throwing them all open.\nIn a stroke of luck, the weather was good, and the detached wing was well placed to soak up the sun. The lack of any creature comforts made it look ascetic and drab, but once it was furnished, Rishe had no doubt it would be lovely.\nLeaving the top floors to air out, Rishe found the stairs to the basement. She pushed the heavy wooden doors open, and mice skittered over her feet. The knights yelped as Rishe descended into the darkness.\n\u201cL-Lady Rishe, why are you going down here?\u201d\n\u201cCleaning supplies are usually kept in the basement. See?\u201d\nThe knights followed her gaze to a duster, broom, dustpan, and pile of fresh cloths. She filled a bucket with water and went to work, rolling up a handkerchief to cover her mouth as she swept dust down from high on the walls. Then she swept up all the dust on the floor.\nIt\u2019s always satisfying to tackle a place this filthy.\nShe corralled the dust bunnies until they were piled up like snow in the center of the hall, and then she swept them out the open door. Once the floors were free of debris, she attacked them with the cloth.\n\u201cLady Rishe, is there anything we can do to help?\nRishe was grateful for the knight\u2019s offer, but she shook her head. \u201cYour job is to guard me, not do my housekeeping.\u201d\n\u201cThis is quite the place to clean on your own, detached though it may be,\u201d the knight said hesitantly. \u201cIt\u2019s not too late to move into the guest chambers instead.\u201d\n\u201cThat\u2019s all right. I like the place already.\u201d\nRishe remained steadfast in her refusal for one reason: readying guest chambers was an awful chore. The palace maids would be expected to work overnight to prepare them, even if the guests were only staying a single night. No speck of dust or strand of hair could remain. Certainly no wrinkled sheets. Rishe knew how exhausting and rigorous a maid\u2019s job was, how nerve-racking.\nShe refused to put the poor dears through such an ordeal for just a few days\u2019 stay. From the sound of things, the palace wasn\u2019t equipped with many housemaids. No doubt they already had their hands full.\n\u201cBesides, take a look.\u201d She held out her arms wide, gesturing to her sparkling clean floor. The knights stared at the bright room in admiration. \u201cCleaning a place with your own hands makes living there that much more satisfying, you see.\u201d\nThe knights smiled their awkward but good-natured agreement.\nRishe worked tirelessly, and before long, the chambers where she would spend the night were ready. The knights offered to carry in the bed, which she allowed.\nWhile they brought in furniture, Rishe started cleaning another room. She had run out of clean water, so she quietly slipped out to the well without informing the knights. It wasn\u2019t quite fair to them, but these were the palace grounds. Surely she didn\u2019t need to be chaperoned everywhere.\nBesides, they\u2019re guards in name only. They\u2019re clearly just here to report my movements to Arnold Hein, Rishe reflected as she walked through a courtyard full of flowers, bucket in hand. Iridescent butterflies cavorted playfully around her feet. He doesn\u2019t seem in a hurry to introduce me to the king. Although if I\u2019m just a hostage, that doesn\u2019t surprise me.\nShe hoped she got to meet the current emperor at least once. The future Arnold\u2019s violent conquest only began after he killed the man and made himself emperor, after all.\nI wonder what happened to Arnold Hein after I died in my past life. Did he reign supreme after winning his war? Or did some country manage to put a stop to his conquest? Whatever the case, I absolutely cannot allow him to start a conflict this time. Being the empress of a wartime nation sounds like so much work! The very thought is unacceptable!\nPerhaps they could divorce, but Rishe had a feeling that if Arnold decided to discard her in the middle of a war, she would fail in her mission to make it past the age of twenty. Better to avoid the situation all together.\nWait. When she thought about it, the cause of every single one of Rishe\u2019s deaths was Arnold and his war. I died fighting. I died when Galkhein\u2019s army invaded\u2026\nLooking at her six lives, all of them had ended in more or less the same way.\nRishe found herself crouched on the ground, cradling her head in her hands. Maybe we should get a divorce right now. But it wasn\u2019t in Rishe\u2019s nature to take back her decisions once she\u2019d made them. \nIf I leave, I\u2019ll probably just die in some war-related disaster again. If I can\u2019t live apart from him, I should take this opportunity to learn everything that I can. \nRishe didn\u2019t know the cause of her repeating lives, but there was no guarantee that the loops were infinite. She had to operate under the possibility that this life could be her last. This required some thought, but standing around seething with anxiety wouldn\u2019t help.\nRight now I\u2019ll focus on cleaning. Once the bath is here, I\u2019ll scrub off all the dust and travel exhaustion. And then I can finally relax! \nBrimming with new determination, she stood up and headed for the well. She was forestalled by the sound of jeering giggles. \n\u201cAww, look at the new girl, trying so hard,\u201d said one voice.\n\u201cAll the enthusiasm in the world won\u2019t make a difference,\u201d said another. \u201cWe\u2019re going to be the crown princess\u2019s maids, not you.\u201d\nThe first added, \u201cHey, are you even listening? Stop wasting your time!\u201d\nRishe heard a weak scream, followed by a thump, like a body hitting the ground. She broke into a run, finding a blonde girl sprawled in the dirt, surrounded by four other women.\n\u201cAre you all right?\u201d Rishe hurried over to help the girl up. Her maid\u2019s uniform\u2014a loose navy-blue dress with a white apron\u2014was smeared with mud. The others were dressed identically.\n\u201cWho are you?\u201d one of the girls snapped at Rishe. She had a mop of blazing-red hair. \u201cAnother newbie?\u201d\nAn understandable mistake. Rishe\u2019s dress was simple, free of ornamentation, and her hair was bound back in a ponytail to keep it out of the way. She was dust-streaked, sweaty, and carrying a bucket in her arms.\nTelling them who I am will be more trouble than it\u2019s worth. Her silence only angered the girls more.\n\u201cAre you one of the crown princess\u2019s maids?",
    "query_text": " They\u2019ve been snatching up every new girl. Those pretty hands of yours don\u2019t look like they\u2019ve ever held a broom,\u201d said one of them.\n\u201cUnfortunately for you, we\u2019ve been working here three years, and we\u2019ll be the ones to serve Prince Arnold as the maids of his palace.\u201d\n\u201cCan you stand? Oh, good, it looks like you\u2019re not injured.\u201d Rishe helped the girl up out of the dirt. \n\u201cHey, don\u2019t ignore us!\u201d the redheaded maid shouted. \u201cYou\u2019ve got some nerve. If you want to make it here, you\u2019ll know your place! I doubt the two of you will last a week!\u201d\nRishe didn\u2019t respond, her attention snagging on something else. The redhead was carrying curtains, probably to bring them to the wash. Rishe stared at them so hard the maid began to shift uncomfortably. \u201cWhat\u2019s your problem"

    "prefix_text": " him at all! Just what is Arnold Hein planning?\nThe quiet of evening fell over the imperial capital of Galkhein.\n \n***\n \n\u201cMmm.\u201d\nSunshine streamed through the window as Rishe roused from sleep. She rolled over, basking in the morning light. The wall she expected wasn\u2019t there, and the bed seemed larger than usual. Taking advantage of it, she stretched out as far as she could.\nWas this her chamber at home? Or maybe she was a merchant again, spending a night at the desert king\u2019s palace. Perhaps this was her bed of straw from her life as a maid? Her memories met and interwove as she drifted into wakefulness.\nWhen Rishe finally opened her eyes, she grew even more confused.\nLight blue curtains surrounded the bed, thin enough to allow sunlight to pass through. She pulled them aside to find herself in a bare room devoid of furniture and carpet.\nOh, right. She didn\u2019t need to report for morning training, tend to her herb garden, prepare breakfast, or see how the bottles she had brewed overnight were coming along.\nRealizing that, Rishe buried her face in the pillow. \u201cSo soft,\u201d she murmured. \nJudging by the position of the sun, it was about six o\u2019clock in the morning. She was pretty sure she had gone to bed around midnight last night.\nI slept for six whole hours? Rishe couldn\u2019t believe it. Generally, she was used to getting about four hours of sleep. On bad days, at the height of an emergency as a knight or apothecary, she wouldn\u2019t even get that much. \nI\u2019ve got nothing but cleaning on the schedule today. Hostages can sleep in, right? At least a little? Excitement suffused her at the thought, but that was interrupted by a knock on the door.\n\u201cLady Rishe, are you awake? It\u2019s Oliver\u2014Prince Arnold\u2019s attendant.\u201d\nRishe sat up with a start. \u201cI\u2019m awake!\u201d\nOliver continued to speak through the door. \u201cI apologize for bothering you at such an early hour. I\u2019m here with a delivery.\u201d\n\u201cJust a moment!\u201d Rishe slipped out of the bed, dressed quickly, and tugged the bed\u2019s canopy closed. She opened the door to find Oliver standing in the hallway with a polite smile.\nHe apologized again. \u201cThis was the only time I could slip away from His Highness\u2019s office. I\u2019m glad to see that you\u2019re already dressed.\u201d\n\u201cNot at all.\u201d Rishe paused, stepping back to allow him inside. \u201cOh my. You look exhausted.\u201d\nOliver grimaced. \u201cIs it that obvious? We\u2019ve been climbing through mountains of paperwork, but never mind me. His Highness has been working around the clock.\u201d\nRishe thought back to yesterday, how he had come all the way out to the balcony. He should have used that spare time to sleep. \u201cHe\u2019s in high demand, isn\u2019t he? He was even working on the trip over.\u201d\n\u201cHe finished all the work he brought along with us,\u201d Oliver confirmed. \u201cNow he\u2019s dealing with everything that piled up during his visit to Hermity.\u201d\n\u201cOh.\u201d Rishe grimaced in sympathy. He may have killed her in a past life, but she wouldn\u2019t wish the bureaucracy of kingship on anyone. \u201cIt\u2019s a shame he had to put his work on hold to attend a silly engagement party.\u201d\n\u201cNo matter. That party was how a committed bachelor finally found a bride.\u201d\nHis smile was sincere, but Rishe knew better. She spread her arms. \u201cGo on. Shall I spin around so you have a better view?\u201d\nOliver blinked. \u201cI beg your pardon?\u201d\n\u201cYou\u2019re looking me over like I\u2019m a horse for sale. If there\u2019s anything I can help you with, please let me know.\u201d\nOliver\u2019s brows went up. He let out a little breath of resignation. \u201cHis Highness was right. You do possess the keen perception of a knight. Of course, I\u2019m purely an amateur myself.\u201d\nI\u2019d say this was a merchant\u2019s sixth sense, rather than battle intuition.\nThis wasn\u2019t the first time Rishe had caught Oliver looking at her. It reminded her of the way her noble customers would examine a product, assessing worth and authenticity. Or a merchant weeding out potential merchandise from a wide array of choices.\nIn other words, he was appraising her.\nOliver moved into a deep, sweeping bow. \u201cMy sincerest apologies, my lady. I have been unaccountably rude to my lord\u2019s consort. My behavior was unacceptable.\u201d\nRishe shook her head. \u201cPlease don\u2019t, it\u2019s fine.\u201d It wasn\u2019t unreasonable for the prince\u2019s closest attendant to be wary of strangers. But it did make her curious. \u201cHow long have you worked for Arnold? Have you always been a valet?\u201d\n\u201cI trained as a squire, actually,\u201d Oliver replied. \u201cBut I was injured and dismissed from the order. His Highness took me into his household soon after. I have served him for nearly a decade.\u201d\n\u201cThen maybe you can answer this,\u201d Rishe said. \u201cWhy is Prince Arnold so very intent on making me his wife?\u201d\nOliver hesitated, as if weighing the pros and cons of speaking, \u201cTo be quite honest, I was as surprised as you were. He\u2019s always insisted he had no interest in marriage. But the sight of you in Hermity has changed his mind. Apparently.\u201d\nSo not even his attendant understood his motives. Rishe remained at a complete loss.\n\u201cIf I may, however?\u201d Oliver mistook Rishe\u2019s confusion for anxiety and added, \u201cI have served Prince Arnold for a long time, and never before have I seen him so happy. When he is with you, he laughs. His smiles are sincere.\u201d\nRishe was taken aback. She\u2019d figured all of Arnold\u2019s laughter and teasing was at her expense. His own private jokes.\n\u201cAre you\u2026unhappy with him?\u201d Oliver ventured. \u201cWith his looks, His Highness is exceedingly popular with the ladies of the court, you know.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m sure he has many admirers.\u201d She paused. \u201cWould you really call the way he acts around me \u2018happy\u2019? To me, it seems more like a cat with a mouse.\u201d\nOliver laughed. He didn\u2019t deny it. \u201cI am pleased you understand His Highness so well. Oh, I nearly forgot. Here.\u201d\nHe held out a sheaf of three documents. \u201cThis is the guest list for your wedding. His Highness bids you look over it.\u201d\n\u201cThank you,\u201d Rishe said, pleasantly surprised. She hadn\u2019t even needed to ask. She gave it a quick glance, quickly identifying the most prominent and powerful names.\nKing Zahad, Prince Kyle, Princess Harriet. And from the Kingdom of Domana, we have Lord Jonal attending as the representative of the king. No surprise there.\nMore than a wedding guest register, this was a list of key people from the countries Arnold would go on to antagonize. Even before the murder of the king and the start of the war, there must have been a trigger\u2014a sea change in the affairs of state. Everyone on this list was most likely involved.\nKing Zahad. I hope we can be friends again like in my first life. Hmm\u2026 Prince Kyle is rather frail. I hope he isn\u2019t working himself too hard. He has a strong sense of responsibility\u2014he\u2019ll attend the wedding even though it\u2019ll be a long trip.\nThe sight of these names filled Rishe with a longing for those lives, for the people she\u2019d once known. And sometime in the very near future, they would all be Galkhein\u2019s enemies.\nIf I take matters into my own hands, perhaps I can salvage some of these relationships before they sour. Even if we aren\u2019t allies, we don\u2019t have to be enemies. Anything to stave off the outbreak of war.\nOliver had no idea what was going through Rishe\u2019s head. Brightly, he continued their conversation. \u201cThe ceremony will be held in three months\u2019 time. All preparations must be complete by then. And now\u2026we need to discuss tonight\u2019s party.\u201d\n\u201cTonight\u2019s what?\u201d\nOliver stiffened. \u201cDid His Highness not tell you?\u201d\n\u201cNo, he most certainly did not! There\u2019s to be a party?\u201d\n\u201cUgh, not again!\u201d Oliver dug his knuckles into his forehead.\nRishe put two and two together. She hesitated, then said, \u201cSo there is one, then. As you must know, His Highness is trying to stamp it down without telling me.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d Oliver replied. \u201cHe should have mentioned it to you. You don\u2019t need to attend, but he will. At least, I hope he will. I think I managed to convince him.\u201d\nShe sympathized with Oliver. Under normal circumstances, it would be unheard of for the crown prince and his fianc\u00e9e to fail to appear at a banquet. \u201cDon\u2019t worry, Oliver. I\u2019ll go.\u201d\nOliver let out a sigh of relief. \u201cReally? Thank you so much, my lady. I\u2019ll put finding you a maid at the top of my to-do list.\u201d\n\u201cNo need.\u201d Rishe smiled. \u201cI can prepare for the party on my own.\u201d\nThis maid-selection process made Rishe uneasy. After witnessing that exchange between the servants in the garden, she imagined quarrels breaking out all through the palace. And she doubted the disputes would go away even after they decided.\nOliver frowned. \u201cBut won\u2019t dressing be difficult without a lady\u2019s maid?\u201d \nShe shook her head. \u201cI can do my hair and put on a gown by myself. I brought dresses and cosmetics from home. Don\u2019t worry.\u201d\nRishe ignored Oliver\u2019s stunned look, already reevaluating her cleaning plans.\n \n***\n \nThe first thing Rishe said to Arnold that night was, \u201cYour Highness, I have a request.\u201d Her gown rustled as she leaned in close. \u201cI would like some herb seed and a corner of the gardens. I made a list. I hope we can discuss this in more detail later.\u201d\nArnold was silent a moment. \u201cRishe.\u201d\n\u201cWhat? Didn\u2019t you tell me to let you know if there was anything I wanted?\u201d She looked at him quizzically, and Arnold sighed.\nShe\u2019d heard that he\u2019d finished his mountain of work and even managed to sleep for a while. He was dressed in his usual military black, trimmed with a red mantle and black gloves.\nArnold shook his head. \u201cThat\u2019s not what I mean. I\u2019m guessing that Oliver didn\u2019t tell you the reason for this party? It\u2019s merely for appearance\u2019s sake. I need to look like I\u2019m searching for a bride within our borders as well. There\u2019s no reason for you to attend.\u201d\nIt made sense. The crown prince\u2014the greatest catch in the kingdom\u2014marrying a foreigner without even the slightest nod to propriety would invite unwanted discontent from the nobility.\n\u201cHowever, we\u2019re betrothed,\u201d Arnold said. \u201cThis whole evening is merely a formality. And with news that you\u2019re my \u2018hostage\u2019 going around, you\u2019ll be an object of curiosity. I don\u2019t want to put you through that.\u201d\n\u201cWell, I already went to the trouble of getting ready.\u201d Rishe plucked at her soft blue dress, draped in fluttering layers around her like a flower bud. She\u2019d braided her hair, decorating it with accessories. Her makeup was light, her shoes polished to a mirror shine. Her only jewelry was a pair of pearl earrings.\n\u201cRishe\u2026\u201d\n\u201cYour Highness, the court may consider my status as a captive princess shameful in the extreme, but I don\u2019t.\u201d She\u2019d chosen this course, after all.\nArnold was again watching her with a mixture of wonder and confusion.\n\u201cSo don\u2019t worry,\u201d she said, extending her hand. \u201cFeel free to show off your fianc\u00e9e.\u201d\nArnold relented, his dashing smile creeping out once again. \u201cVery well. I should take advantage of this opportunity to touch my betrothed.\u201d\n\u201cWe\u2019re wearing gloves.\u201d\nArnold took Rishe\u2019s hand.\nA throng of guests was gathered in the ballroom as a group of musicians performed on a platform. Women in gowns stood clustered, while gentlemen in military attire grouped together. A mere glance was enough to tell their clothes were of the highest quality. They mingled happily, making small talk with glasses in hand.\nRishe let her hand rest on Arnold\u2019s arm as she paused at the threshold to take it all in. \u201cThis is a bigger event than I was expecting.\u201d\n\u201cIs it? I\u2019d say it\u2019s a rather small gathering, actually.\u201d\n\u201cMaybe for a military powerhouse,\u201d Rishe muttered. \nYet another reminder of Galkhein\u2019s wealth took her off guard. Arnold just looked bored.\n\u201cThe size doesn\u2019t matter,\u201d he said. \u201cIn the end, they\u2019re only here for gossip. Look, here they come.\u201d\nIn the blink of an eye, they were surrounded by guests.\n\u201cPrince Arnold, thank you for gracing us with an invitation,\u201d said one man. \u201cSuch a pleasure.\u201d \n\u201cThe pleasure is mine, Lord Abel,\u201d Arnold drawled.\n\u201cYour Highness! We were so glad to hear of your safe return,\u201d another guest chirped. \u201cPlease, our daughter is simply dying to be regaled with tales of your trip.\u201d\n\u201cI can\u2019t imagine I\u2019d have anything particularly exciting to share with her,\u201d Arnold said curtly.\nAfter the last few days, Rishe found this look of glazed apathy disturbing. His good looks only compounded it\u2014he was so handsome that every expression was stark.\nHe looks more like Emperor Arnold Hein now, but still not the same.\nArnold appeared to notice her watching him. When he looked at her, his sourness disappeared, replaced by a genuine smile. All around him, women found themselves flushing. Arnold paid no heed to their fervent gazes, instead leaning in to give Rishe a brief moment of consideration.\nThen he leaned in close enough to kiss her.\n\u201cA dull trip,\u201d he said again, pulling away. \u201cBut fortuitous. Without it, I would have never met the woman destined to be my wife.\u201d\nA shocked murmur rolled through the crowd. Rishe, who hadn\u2019t recovered from seeing Arnold\u2019s beautiful face at close range, barely noticed the looks of utter loathing the assembled women were throwing her.\n\u201cH",

He\u2019s never even looked at us!\u201d\nThey were whispers, but they carried.\nA portly man stepped forward with his daughter in tow. \u201cYour Highness, do you mean to say that this lovely young woman is your fianc\u00e9e?\u201d\nEvery eye in the ballroom was on Rishe, alight with curiosity, envy, or schemes. None of them could hide their contempt. But Rishe didn\u2019t falter.\nThis is nothing compared to being publicly dumped in a banquet hall. And I\u2019ve done that seven times!\nShe offered a polite smile and an astoundingly correct curtsy. Left leg at a diagonal behind the right, back straight, head bowed. \u201cHow do you do? My name is Rishe Irmgard Weitzner.\u201d\n"

She accepted Arnold\u2019s encouragement as the escape it was.\nJust when I least expect it, he\u2019ll act the gentleman. Maybe he\u2019d remembered her demand for a carefree life of doing nothing.\nRishe cast a charming look across the crowd. \u201cThank you for your consideration, Your Highness. Forgive me.\u201d She gave a polite bow before quietly slipping away. \nShe didn\u2019t head straight to the balcony but rather slowly walked around the hall. There was only so much she could find out glued to Arnold\u2019s side all night.\nI need information. Galkhein\u2019s political landscape was a mystery to me through all my past lives. I only know the rumors that made it abroad.\nAlthough she knew of Arnold\u2019s eventual patricide, she had no concept of the circumstances leading up to it. She needed a better picture of the factions and power balance inside the court. The lives these people led.\nI know better than to believe wartime gossip. This Arnold Hein is a lot different from what I\u2019d heard he was like at nineteen. He\u2019s not as diabolical as the rumors led me to believe. He likes to push, but he isn\u2019t unkind. The thought drifted across her mind, leaving her conflicted. Well, he\u2019s not unkind now. But I still don\u2019t like not knowing his motives. And he\u2019s a bit of a jerk, to be honest. \nShe tried to settle her mind and just observe. Gathering intelligence was necessary to lead a long, carefree life lazing around the palace.\nIf I recall correctly, that\u2019s Lord Hannawald. He seems to be on good terms with Count Gayle. Duke Hudemann and Duke Teinitz are having a friendly enough conversation, yet they don\u2019t seem close. Rishe ticked off the names of people she\u2019d met, committing them to memory.\nA wave of sweet perfume wafted over her. A pretty girl with soft blonde hair had appeared at her side. \u201cHow do you do, Lady Rishe? I\u2019m Cornelia Thea Toona.\u201d\nDuke Toona\u2019s family was the thirty-first house she\u2019d met tonight.\nRishe smiled graciously. \u201cRishe Irmgard Weitzner. A pleasure to meet you.\u201d\n\u201cThe pleasure is all mine.\u201d Cornelia smiled sweetly. Her eyes were big and bright, her lips full. She held a glass in each hand and offered one to Rishe. \u201cWine? I see you\u2019re empty-handed.\u201d\nA gaggle of other ladies nearby began giggling among themselves.\n\u201cHow dare she act so haughty when she\u2019s a captive. It\u2019s time for her learn just what she is. A pawn to be played and discarded.\u201d\n\u201cShe should enjoy her time on Prince Arnold\u2019s arm while she can.\u201d\n\u201cShe is from a minor nation, after all.\u201d\nAs Rishe took note of their whispers, Cornelia gazed at her with doe eyes. \u201cDoes my offering offend you in some way?\u201d\nIf I remember correctly, House Toona holds a vast territory in southern Galkhein.\nRishe held out a hand to accept the glass. \u201cHow could it? Thank you, Lady Cornelia.\u201d\nBefore Rishe could touch the glass, Cornelia gave a dramatic shout. \u201cOh dear! My hand slipped!\u201d She dropped it, quite obviously on purpose. Without thinking, Rishe grabbed her skirts and leaned back, plucking the glass out of the air with the other hand.\nCornelia let out a cry of surprise as Rishe caught the wine before any could spill. She swirled the glass and brought it to her nose to breathe in the bouquet.\nHmm\u2026 That\u2019s mashed capsicum. Where did she even get that? What a waste of perfectly good wine. And why bother spicing it enough to singe the tongue if she just planned to ruin my dress? Pick a plan, my dear.\nHiding her exasperation, Rishe smiled brightly. \u201cI\u2019ve never had a wine quite like this. What an unusual scent.\u201d\nCornelia bit her lip in frustration. Rishe beamed at her. You\u2019ve got such a pretty face, Lady Toona. Why don\u2019t you smile?\nRishe leaned in close to Cornelia. \u201cThis vintage isn\u2019t available where I\u2019m from. I\u2019m ever so anxious to learn more. Should I perhaps invite Prince Arnold over to enjoy a glass? Which tray did you get this from?\u201d\n\u201cWhat? Oh, um\u2026\u201d Rishe had a policy of never backing down from a fight, but it seemed Cornelia didn\u2019t share it. \u201cS-sorry, but I don\u2019t remember. Such a large hall, you see.\u201d\n\u201cA shame. I\u2019ll just give His Highness this one, then. I\u2019ll be sure to let him know who it\u2019s from.\u201d\n\u201cUh, wait!\u201d Cornelia rapidly shook her head. \u201cI-I got that glass for you, so I think you should\u2014you know what? Never mind! Maybe I should just take that\u2014oh no!\u201d\nRishe ignored the ashen-faced Cornelia, raising the glass and swallowing down a gulp. \n\u201cI-I can\u2019t believe\u2026\u201d\n\u201cSuch a spicy flavor, just as I imagined.\u201d Rishe smiled again to the assembled group\u2019s astonishment. \u201cWhat a warm welcome. I do hope the two of us can spend more time together. Perhaps\u2026a tea party?\u201d\n\u201cTh-the two of us?\u201d Cornelia stammered.\n\u201cYes. I want to know all about House Toona.\u201d\nCornelia looked flabbergasted, but she recovered herself and nodded.\nThat should do. One of Rishe\u2019s eventual plans required a plot of land in a temperate climate. House Toona\u2019s would likely be perfect, but she needed to confirm a few things with Cornelia. Never back down from a fight. Even further\u2026\nShe recalled the words of her mentor from her days as a merchant.\nDon\u2019t bother with fights you can\u2019t win.\nThe other ladies fled, fearful of this strange girl who gulped down painfully spicy wine like it was nothing. \n \n***\n \nRishe retreated to the empty balcony to enjoy the music, grimacing with every stinging mouthful of wine. She drank it in decreasing sips until Arnold joined her.\n\u201cWhat are you making that face for?\u201d\nRishe swirled the glass. \u201cDon\u2019t worry, it\u2019s not you. It\u2019s just this wine is so spicy.\u201d\n\u201cSpicy? The wine is?\u201d\n\u201cMm. It\u2019s seasoned with capsicum. I barely managed to get that first mouthful down without gagging.\u201d\nArnold swiped the glass from her hand. \u201cDon\u2019t tell me this was a poisoning attempt!\u201d\nRishe clicked her tongue in annoyance at her own lack of vigilance. No one else would be able to grab something",

They ruined a perfectly good glass of wine because of me. I\u2019m not going to waste it.\u201d She grabbed it back and took another sip, shuddering at the taste.\nArnold glowered. \u201cTell me who did this. I\u2019ll"

Diana and the other maids whose names hadn\u2019t been called were getting their wind back, wearing increasingly triumphant looks.\nRishe said, \u201cThe twenty names I just called will be my maids.\u201d\nTime seemed to stand still a moment, and then Oliver broke in with an astonished, \u201cB-but, my lady!

The rest of us get so much more done in a shorter amount of time!\u201d\n\u201cWatch your tongue, girl,\u201d Oliver said sharply.\nDiana ignored him. \u201cWe\u2019re hard workers! Any job you assign us, we can do it! Please, I beg you, my lady!\u201d\n\u201cStep back,\u201d Oliver warned. \u201cDo not take a single step closer to Lady Rishe.\u201d\nDiana spoke in a rush, words pouring out of her. \u201cI-I freely admit that I was impolite before, but I didn\u2019t know who she was! I\u2019ll take any punishment, so please, give me the chance to show you how well I can work!\u201d\nRishe said, \u201cDiana, I have a request.\u201d\n\u201cTh-thank you, my lady!\u201d Diana heaved a sigh of relief. \u201cYou mean you\u2019ll\u2014\u201d \nRishe cut across her. \u201cAs of today, you are no longer a maid in this palace.\u201d \n\u201cWhat?\u201d Her face, usually so fixed with determination, paled. \u201cBut why? I\u2019m so much better than any of them! I\u2019ll do a perfect job no matter what task you set before me. Please don\u2019t dismiss me, my lady!\u201d \n\u201cListen to me, Diana.\u201d Rishe dropped her lofty tone, speaking as one woman would to another. \u201cYou have noticed it, haven\u2019t you? No matter what you claim, these new girls aren\u2019t worthless.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2026I don\u2019t understand.\u201d\n\u201cCan you remember your first month in service? How difficult it was?\u201d\nDiana looked completely bewildered. Her gaze darted around as if looking for help.\nPulling herself together, she forced herself to follow Rishe\u2019s directions. She thought back and finally alighted on a response. \u201cI\u2026I didn\u2019t know how to do the job. Before, when my family was still prominent, I\u2019d washed shirts and bedsheets. Never gowns or military uniforms.\u201d\n\u201cPerfectly reasonable,\u201d Rishe said. \u201cOnly natural for someone just starting out.\u201d\n\u201cThe older girls were so busy, they told me to just watch them since they didn\u2019t have time to teach me. When I had questions\u2026well, there was nobody to ask.\u201d\n\u201cI bet. And did you have any other problems?\u201d\n\u201cWell, yes. There was a lot to learn. Different kinds of soap and washboards depending on the cloth. You use different tools for different materials. I had to learn how they worked and how to put them away. I was\u2026punished if I didn\u2019t get it right the first time.\u201d\nThe newcomers were exchanging surprised looks. Rishe understood why.\nEverything Diana said was familiar to them. They spent valuable time searching for their materials and the proper ways to use them, but they shrank from asking for help. Everyone always looked so busy. This was a universal problem.\n\u201cDespite all that, I got better!\u201d Diana protested. \u201cI only needed to be taught once. Unlike them! They\u2019re useless!\u201d\n\u201cYes, well. There\u2019s a difference between you and them,\u201d Rishe told Diana. \u201cYou can read and write.\u201d\n\u201cOh!\u201d Diana started in surprise. Elsie looked at the floor.\nThe literacy rate among commoners was low no matter where you went. Very few families had the means to afford an education, especially for daughters. Diana had been born to a merchant\u2019s family\u2014she\u2019d received formal schooling. The maids she was close friends with were likely from similar backgrounds. The majority of those in service were not so fortunate.\n\u201cWhat if you only received instructions on how to do a job once and weren\u2019t able to write it down to remind yourself later?\u201d Rishe asked. \u201cWould you be so confident?\u201d\n\u201cI-I don\u2019t\u2014\u201d Diana reflexively thrust a hand into her apron pocket, where she had a list of daily tasks recorded in her neat handwriting to reference throughout the day. Hopefully now she would understand how much of an edge her privileged literacy gave her over the other maids.\n\u201cEveryone else works as hard as they can, just like you do,\u201d Rishe said. \u201cRemember how it was for you at first? They all have to start somewhere. I hope you\u2019ll keep that in mind.\u201d\n\u201cThey\u2019re no different from me,\u201d Diana mumbled begrudgingly, glancing around the room, looking at the less experienced maids. As if coming to a decision, she said, \u201cI\u2019m sorry.\u201d\n\u201cDiana?\u201d\nLike a child enumerating her regrets, Diana went on, \u201cI\u2019ve done you wrong, all of you. It\u2019s just, I had nothing. Or so it felt like. No money, no title. I thought I had to make my way in the world on my own. That I had to start from zero.\u201d Her shoulders trembled as she buried her face in her hands. \u201cBut I was wrong! I wasn\u2019t starting from zero. I had everything that I learned growing up. I didn\u2019t realize how fortunate I was. I let it all go to my he\n \n\u201cRISHE IRMGARD WEITZNER! You are a vile woman! A truly malicious creature unworthy of the crown prince! As of this instant, our engagement is off!\u201d \n\u201cAs you wish, Your Highness.\u201d\n\u201c\u2026Huh?\u201d\nThe prince\u2019s declaration echoed throughout the ballroom. Rishe, the duke\u2019s daughter, bowed in response, her coral-toned hair swaying gracefully. The assembled guests found themselves captivated by her dignified beauty. Despite having just witnessed a broken engagement, they couldn\u2019t bring themselves to pity her.\nSlowly, Rishe lifted her head and fixed the prince with a pale-emerald gaze. It caught him off guard, but he quickly recovered.\n\u201cDidn\u2019t you hear what I just said?! I\u2019m calling off our engagement! Doesn\u2019t that trouble you?\u201d\n\u201cNot really.\u201d\nRishe already knew what happened next: false accusations, exile, and her family severing all ties and leaving her to survive on her own. She turned from the prince. There was no point wasting any time.\nThis is my seventh loop, after all.\nRishe had done this all before.\nThe next few hours will be busy. I must hurry and retrieve my things before I\u2019m barred from the family estate. I don\u2019t want this to be one of the times I\u2019m too slow and I have to start my new life with nothing.\n\u201cRishe, halt and hear me! I have spent the past week perfecting my recitation of your crimes!\u201d\nI should take more than dresses this time\u2014there\u2019s plenty of things I could use out in the world. What trade should I take up? In my first life, I was a merchant. In my second, an apothecary. I\u2019ve got a few more I want to try out\u2026 Augh! If time\u2019s just going to keep resetting, I wish I could start at an earlier point. I need more time to prepare!\n\u201cWait! Rishe!\u201d\nThe crown prince was on the verge of tears, and the spectators struggled to suppress their snickers. \nA thought occurred to Rishe, and she stopped. She then turned, her eyes gleaming beneath long lashes as she stared down her ex-fianc\u00e9. \u201cAh, Your Highness, I almost forgot.\u201d \n\u201cYes, tell me!\u201d the prince fumed. \u201cLet me guess, you are hurt beyond measure and yet love me still\u2026correct?\u201d\nAs if. Rishe was grateful to be granted her freedom. In fact, she was smiling as she said, \u201cI hope you and Lady Mary are happy together.\u201d\n\u201cWhat?!\u201d\n\u201cMay we both lead fulfilling lives. Farewell!\u201d Rishe lifted the skirts of her evening gown and turned on her heel, departing as briskly as she could.\n\u201cHow do you know about Mary? I haven\u2019t told you I love her!\u201d The prince was shouting something behind her, but she paid him no mind. She had things to do.\nDuring her first loop, the prince\u2019s accusations had shocked her to the core and she\u2014foolishly so\u2014had attempted to defend herself. Now she knew better than to expect the prince to behave reasonably. \nHow will life unfold this time? I\u2019m excited to find out! Rishe fixed her mind on the future.\nThis is my seventh \u201cdo-over.\u201d I\u2019ve led happy and carefree lives before, but this time\u2014this time, I swear I\u2019ll live a long happy and carefree life!\nIn other words, she needed to avoid getting killed. At any cost. \n \n***\n \nIn the first loop, with her engagement broken and her reputation in tatters, Rishe roamed with nothing but the clothes on jewelry. Finding them a good-natured band, she hitched a ride to a neighboring country.\nFrom the merchant caravan, she learned a trade, studying how to procure stock and balance ledgers. Eventually, she set out on her own to travel the world. Her upbringing as a daughter of the nobility meant that, even at fifteen years old, Rishe possessed a keen sense for beauty.\nShe collected things that caught her eye and sold them to whoever found delight in her wares. Before she realized it, she had become a major vendor, employing a full staff. She had even done business with the king of a desert nation and the prince of a frozen country up north. She traveled to many distant places, realizing a dream born from her cossetted former life spent doing nothing but preparing to be queen.\nFive years passed, and just as she had only one country left to visit, Rishe fell victim to the war sweeping across the continent.\nThe next thing she knew, she was fifteen years old again and back at that party, with the prince poised to make his pronouncement.\n\u201cRishe Irmgard Weitzner! You are a vile woman! A truly malicious creature unworthy of the crown prince! As of this instant, our engagement is off!\u201d\nNaturally, she didn\u2019t understand what was going on at first. She looked around. Everything was the same. She stood in the same place wearing the same dress and draped in the same jewelry she\u2019d sold to the caravan.\nWas it a dream? Or was everything that had happened up until then the dream? In her confusion, all she could do was stare.\nRishe hurried out of the ballroom, the impending threat of exile hanging over her and the prince\u2019s entreaties to halt ringing in her ears.\nThis is perfect! Now I can get it right! I\u2019ll grab everything valuable from my room.\nRishe had enjoyed her life as a merchant, but she had always felt a stirring of regret about this night. If only she\u2019d brought some funds from home, she would\u2019ve had the capital to establish her business much sooner!\nSpeaking of this regret always prompted disbelief from her customers, including the king of the desert. \u201cWhat? That\u2019s what you\u2019d want to do over?!\u201d\nWhen she arrived back at home on the night of her second life, Rishe grabbed her jewelry box and as many of the books her late grandmother had left her as she could carry, then made haste to the forest to meet the caravan. But the stop at her house took time, and she missed them completely.\nIn that moment, Rishe made a stark realization. Different choices meant different mistakes. Opening one door would close another.\nAnd so the easy path to a life in commerce was closed to her.\nSure, she could try to build her business from the ground up, but personal connections were almost as essential to being a merchant as business savvy. It just wasn\u2019t realistic without a single acquaintance. \nSorting through her belongings in resignation, she came across a foreign encyclopedia of herbs among her grandmother\u2019s books. Taking it as a sign, Rishe sold her jewels elsewhere and used the funds to cross the sea and pursue the study of medicine.\nFortunately, Rishe retained all her knowledge from her previous life. She remembered that certain expensive herbs could be acquired cheaply in other regions. When word spread of a disease running rampant in a neighboring country, she recalled that too. This foreknowledge proved invaluable, as did her wide travel and exposure to many different teachers with many different points of view.\nAs such, Rishe led a successful life as an apothecary. She saved a feeble prince, synthesized a number of rare medicines with her mercantile knowledge, and thus spent her days in the simple joy of helping those in need.\nUnfortunately, all the joy in the world couldn\u2019t stand up to an epidemic. Thus ended her second life. \nOnce again, she found herself in the moment of her broken engagement, the curtain rising on the third loop. Her next four lives proceeded much the same way. As a skilled lady\u2019s maid, she helped a young noblewoman to a fortuitous marriage. Once, she even disguised herself as a man and became a knight. Every life was worth living, and she enjoyed them all. She enjoyed living, period.\nThere was just one problem.\nNo matter what I do, I die at twenty.\nShe enjoyed her lives, but she was not permitted to do so for long. With this time limit always hanging over her, she spent each loop in a state of constant activity.\nI would love to take it easy for a while. Is a little leisure time too much to ask? Obviously I don\u2019t want to die either! This time, I\u2019ll make as much money as I can in the first five years. Then, when I turn twenty, I\u2019ll live a life free of worldly cares. I\u2019ll do whatever\u2019s necessary to stay alive!\nHer mind made up, Rishe began her seventh life in a dead sprint through the palace. Regardless of her future plans, she was in a race against time. She needed to beat the messenger bearing news of her scandal.\nAs she ran, she yanked off her hair ornaments; she planned to sell them and didn\u2019t want to risk losing one. Her hair billowed out behind her, falling in loose waves.\nSuddenly, an idea occurred to her, one she hadn\u2019t had in any of her previous six lives.\nLeaving through the palace gardens would be faster. I can climb down a tree from the balcony.\nRishe had gone to war as a knight in the life just before this one. After the punishing battlefield training, climbing trees was nothing.\nSeamlessly, she changed direction. She raced for the balcony, where she ran into something at full speed.\n\u201cBwargh!\u201d Rishe let out a very unladylike grunt, staggering a few steps. She looked up to see what she\u2019d bounced off of. \u201cOh\u2026\u201d\nAn exceptionally handsome man stood in her path.\nHe had refined, patrician features and cruel, thin lips. He was slender yet powerful; even through his clothes, Rishe could tell his body was well conditioned. His jet-black hair covered his ears, creeping down to the nape of his neck. The tips of his locks bounced with his movements. They looked to be soft to the touch.\nFrom head to toe, he was a pleasure to look at\u2014but what held Rishe\u2019s attention were his eyes. They were long in shape and impossibly blue, but they possessed a blade-sharp intensity. His gaze was clear, beautiful, and cold as ice. His eyelashes cast shadows on his striking face. He was a work of art.\nCurrently, this work of art was staring her down with a look that could kill.\nHe laughed. \u201cYou barreled right into me. For a moment, I thought I\u2019d been attacked by a wild boar.\u201d\nIt was an exceedingly rude thing to say to a stranger, but as luck would have it, this man was not a stranger. At least not to Rishe.\n\u201cWhat are you even doing here?\u201d the man went on. \u201cThe party is in the\u2014\u201d\nRishe interrupted him with a wordless shout",

Rishe had crossed swords with this man. Recently. He was the one responsible for ending her sixth life. \nHe must be a guest at the banquet.

Rishe, how dare you make me wait so long?\u201d\nRishe\u2019s ex-fianc\u00e9, Crown Prince Dietrich, stepped triumphantly forward.\n\u201cI know the thought of hearing your crimes enumerated by the man you love must pain you, but alas, as future king, it is my duty to bring down the hammer of justice upon a villainess such as yourself!\u201d\n\u201cI see I\u2019ve timed it badly,\u201d Rishe muttered. \u201cIn fact, this is my worst loop yet. I\u2019d rather be barred from the house than see you again.\u201d\n\u201cHmm? What are you grumbling about?\u201d Dietrich looked Rishe up and down. \u201cI knew it. You put on a brave face, but I can sense the sorrow in your heart.\u201d\n\u201cI beg your pardon?\u201d\n\u201cYour heart!\u201d the prince repeated. \u201cYour heart! It must be absolutely crushed! Because I called off our engagement!\u201d\nRishe wasn\u2019t sure where he was drawing these conclusions from. Possibly the same place he mined for all his bottomless self-confidence.\n\u201cI can tell you\u2019ve been wandering aimlessly, distraught,\u201d the prince went on. \u201cLook at you. Your dress is caked in mud, your shoes are broken, and there are cuts marring your face and arms. What other possible cause could there be than heartbreak?\u201d\nRishe narrowed her eyes. \u201cDo you ever stop to think about the words coming out of your mouth?\u201d\n\u201cWhat?\u201d\nHis interpretation of events was fanciful to the point of absurdity. \u201cI did not dirty my dress or snap my shoes out of heartbreak. Because I feel none. You\u2019ve always been a little slow, so I\u2019ll make this clear: I do not have a single shred of fondness for you, or for our broken engagement.\u201d\n\u201cWhat?!\u201d the prince said. \u201cWhat are you saying?!\u201d\nThe surrounding crowd began to snicker.\n\u201cIsn\u2019t that the crown prince? Did Lady Rishe just dump him?\u201d\n\u201cWait, but wasn\u2019t he trying to dump her?\u201d\n\u201cCan\u2019t be! Look at her! She doesn\u2019t care at all!\u201d\n\u201cHow dare you nobodies make sport of me?\u201d Dietrich screeched. \u201cI am your prince!\u201d\nTemper aside, Dietrich was a handsome man. He had azure-blue eyes and blond hair\u2014a prince straight out of a picture book. His looks and place in the succession meant a never-ending swarm of women vying for his affections. He was brought up a pampered princeling, never wanting for anything. It manifested in a pompous manner and an overconfidence in his own abilities. Rishe had cautioned him about his attitude before, but he never paid her any mind.\nI\u2019m so glad I don\u2019t have to marry him.\nShe wished she could go back and tell the shocked, scared girl from her first life not to worry about her shattered engagement. Still, she might as well say it all here and now, with the assembled knights and citizens to bear witness.\n\u201cYour Highness, you exist to love and protect your people. It\u2019s unbecoming to speak of them in this manner.\u201d\n\u201cYou\u2019re the unbecoming one!\u201d the prince snapped. \u201cBeg me for forgiveness!\u201d\n\u201cI won\u2019t. Calling off our betrothal is the best course, and I applaud Your Highness for your good sense.\u201d\nNow even the knights were trembling with suppressed mirth. \nDietrich was turning red. \u201cD-don\u2019t laugh at me!\u201d\n\u201cLady Rishe,\u201d came a sweet voice. \u201cAren\u2019t you ashamed of yourself?\u201d \nRishe fought down a groan.\nOut of the crowd stepped a charming, dainty girl. Her big eyes moist with tears, she took her place at Dietrich\u2019s side. \u201cI do not allow the people I care about to be treated so very ill!\u201d \n\u201cWhy, Lady Mary. You\u2019re here.\u201d Rishe sighed. \u201cHow nice.\u201d\nThe young Mary scowled through her tears. Hidden behind her skirts, Dietrich continued to shout his disapproval. \u201cRishe! You\u2019ve brought my beloved Mary to tears! She\u2019s told me everything. How you bullied her, ridiculed her. How you find it amusing to lock her in the classroom overnight! Such a wicked woman could never be queen!\u201d\nNone of that\u2019s true.\nRishe glanced at Mary, who averted her gaze a little awkwardly.\n\u201cMore importantly,\u201d Rishe said, \u201chave you already brought your concerns to my parents, Your Highness?\u201d\n\u201cMore importantly?! I did, if you must know! Your parents are furious. They have vowed to disown you.\u201d\n\u201cAh. Then I\u2019m too late.\u201d Her parents held their reputation above all else. Rishe had little hope of retrieving any of her money or belongings now.\n\u201cWhy are you acting so strangely?\u201d Dietrich sniffed. \u201cAh, I understand. You\u2019re in such shock from this turn of events that\u2014\u201d\n\u201cListen, Dietrich.\u201d In her exasperation, Rishe dropped his title. \u201cI accept your decree. We are no longer engaged. I shall never darken your doorstep again. So\u2026relax a little.\u201d\n\u201cHuh? What are you saying?\u201d\n\u201cSince I was a child, I believed that my only value was in our betrothal.

She\u2019d wondered when the news of the dead and dying reached her apothecary. When she had comforted her terrified mistress in her life as a maid, assuring her everything would be all right. When she squared off against him in battle, as he plunged a sword through her heart\u2014even then she wondered. \nIf I stick around, maybe I\u2019ll finally have my answer. Half of her was dying to know. The other half didn\u2019t give a damn. And yet\u2026\nShe recalled a childhood dream. Rather, a longing.\nRishe let out a breath. \u201cYou claim you are enamored with me.\u201d\n\u201cYes. I am completely under your spell.\u201d\nTo think he could spout such nonsense with a straight face!\n\u201cThen will you grant me anything I desire?\u201d\n\u201cSo long as it is within my power,\u201d Arnold said. \u201cAnything you want will be yours.\u201d\nRishe hesitated, gathering her thoughts. \u201cI have some conditions.\u201d Arnold silently motioned for her to go on. \u201cI want full control over the wedding festivities. Everything must be procured through merchants of my choosing.\u201d\n\u201cFine.\u201d Arnold nodded. \u201cYou\u2019re free to do business with whomever you wish.\u201d\n\u201cAfter we are married, I must be in a position to mingle with guests from abroad.\u201d\n\u201cThat sounds within the purview of the crown princess. Anything else?\u201d\n\u201cI will be allowed to live in a separate residence from your mother and father.\u201d\nShe meant this seriously, but it made Arnold laugh. \u201cYou don\u2019t seem the type to worry about an overbearing mother-in-law.\u201d\n\u201cYou would be surprised. Combative relationships with one\u2019s new family are the most difficult part of marriage, or so they say. It could be a ramshackle cottage for all I care\u2014I just require a secondary residence.\u201d\nActually, Rishe didn\u2019t care at all about in-laws. When Arnold set his war into motion, his first move would be the assassination of his father. A genuine coup by patricide, not at all like Dietrich\u2019s clumsy attempt. Next, he would name himself emperor, take control of the country, and mobilize the military.\nSeparating him from his parents will make the first step more difficult\u2014although not impossible, unfortunately.\n\u201cAnything else?\u201d Arnold asked. \u201cI\u2019ll do whatever it takes to marry you.\u201d\n\u201cIdeally, I\u2019d like to know your endgame,\u201d Rishe said with dignity. \u201cBut as I doubt there\u2019s any chance of that, I have one final request.\u201d She jabbed a finger into his face, regardless of how rude it was. \u201cI will spend my time idling around the castle. No work, no study. I shall be utterly useless.\u201d\nLet\u2019s see just how much you want me as your princess.\nAfter a long moment of silence, Arnold cracked a merry laugh. The proposal remained; all her conditions were met.\n\n(2) chapter number given is likely out of range: 0\nChapter: 7\n\nChapter 2\nChapter 2\n \n\u201cYOU KNOW, it was only after I went into commerce that I truly had a dream for the future,\u201d Rishe had once confided in a friend. \u201cUp until then, I existed only as the crown prince\u2019s fianc\u00e9e or my father\u2019s daughter. My every act was to become more worthy of that status. But now, for the first time, I actually have a goal of my own.\u201d\n\u201cOh, yeah?\u201d her friend said. He was the ruler of the desert kingdom, and his smile was awfully charming. \u201cWhat\u2019s that?\u201d\nRishe smiled back. \u201cI want to travel to every single country in the world. I want to see everything in every town, peruse their markets, and meet the eyes of every person who lives there!\u201d\nBy now, that felt like such a distant dream.\n \n***\n \nRishe awoke with a start, eyes snapping open as she sensed a disturbance in the air.\nShe unsheathed her sword halfway, primed for danger. \nInside the coach, her old enemy sat across from her, one hand outstretched. \u201cWhat do you think you\u2019re doing?\u201d she demanded.\nWhen they\u2019d boarded the coach, Rishe had warned him not to lay a single finger on her throughout the trip to his kingdom. Ordering the prince not to touch his consort was absurd, but Arnold readily agreed. He had, after all, promised to follow her every direction.\nAnd yet, here he was, already breaking his promise.\nArnold appeared unperturbed by her glare. \u201cDon\u2019t look at me like that. I was merely trying to recover what you took from me.\u201d\nConfused, Rishe looked at the sword in her hand. It had a black lacquered scabbard with a simple golden decoration. Engraved on the hilt was the Galkhein crest.\n\u201cOh!\u201d Rishe thrust the sword back at Arnold. \u201cMy apologies.\u201d\nArnold chuckled. \u201cYou caught me off guard. You were nodding off, and then you suddenly snatched up my sword. You looked quite content snuggling up with it.\u201d\nArnold propped the sword beside him. Rishe pressed a hand to her chest to quell her racing heart. The sword that gutted me in my previous life is now my bedmate. What a world. Her recent stint as a knight had left her ill at ease without a blade at hand. She just couldn\u2019t believe it was Arnold\u2019s she\u2019d reached for.\n\u201cI didn\u2019t mean to disturb you, but I doubted sleeping with a weapon would be comfortable. I\u2019m impressed you sensed my intent before I even touched you.\u201d Arnold rested one elbow against the window frame, watching her with shameless fascination. \u201cOne only develops instincts like that from combat training. And you were also a member of the court? How in the world did you find the time?\u201d\nRishe shrugged. She couldn\u2019t just say, I pretended to be a man in a previous life, that\u2019s how.\n\u201cI assume there\u2019s more to you than your devotion to the sword. You seem to like flowers.\u201d\nShe followed Arnold\u2019s gaze to where she\u2019d bundled a small bouquet in a handkerchief. This was their fifth day on the road to Galkhein. Every day, without fail, she\u2019d picked flowers whenever they stopped to water the horses. The ones from today were still fresh, but the ones she\u2019d begun drying five days ago were just about ready.\n\u201cI didn\u2019t pick these because they\u2019re pretty.\u201d Rishe brought the blooms to her face, spirits rising at their sweet scent. Spring wildflowers had a soft and gentle smell. Rishe looked out the window at the forest spreading toward Galkhein, thinking of the rare native flowers going into bloom. She wished she could pick those as well, but that would cause too much delay. She gazed on wistfully.\nAfter watching her in silence for some time, Arnold said, \u201cBy the way, I sent one of my men ahead on a fast horse to deliver your order to the company you requested. They\u2019ll be invited to Galkhein to discuss the wedding ceremony.\u201d\n\u201cThank you,\u201d Rishe said. \u201cI\u2019m glad you kept your word.\u201d\n\u201cThe Aria Trading Company,\u201d Arnold mused. \u201cI\u2019ve heard of them. They\u2019re up-and-comers, aren\u2019t they? Have you done business with them before?\u201d\n\u201cNo, but I heard from a friend that they hold a very high standard of quality.\u201d\nRishe was pleasantly surprised at how easily Arnold had acceded to her request. Typically, a royal household had their own personal dealer. Getting them to do business with someone else could be difficult.\nI want to establish a connection with Aria as soon as possible, Rishe thought. It was, of course, the company that had taken her in during her first life.\nThe company had been established just two years prior to picking her up by its owner, a man named Tully. They were still in their growth stage, but in just a few years, they would be the grandest trading company in all the world. They\u2019d proven a great boon in her life as an apothecary as well, helping to distribute her newest medicines. She\u2019d struggled to win their trust initially, but she pledged to work much harder this time around.\nThis marriage isn\u2019t going to happen\u2014I need an escape plan for when it all falls apart. I must bring to bear all my knowledge and influence as a crown princess.\nRishe didn\u2019t know Arnold\u2019s plans, but she had no intention of sitting around and waiting for him to use her as he pleased. She\u2019d spend her time as his consort wisely. Everything must serve her ultimate goal: to live longer than five years, and live well.\nHer fierce determination must have shown on her face because Arnold gave her a little bemused smile. \u201cYes?\u201d\nGod! Rishe grimaced at that flawlessly handsome countenance. Such beauty, possessed by such powerful destruction. The fact that he\u2019d been the man to kill her did nothing to lessen her fascination. In fact, it almost made it worse. The study of contrasts.\n\u201cSorry, I just\u2014\u201d\nShe was interrupted by the horses\u2019 loud whinnies.\n\u201cStop! Hey, stop the coach!\u201d\nShouts drifted back from conveyance ahead of theirs, which contained the luggage and attendants. The squadron of knights tailing the column of coaches sped off toward the front.\n\u201cWho do you think you\u2014graaargh!\u201d\nThat didn\u2019t sound good. Rishe moved to climb out, but Arnold was faster. He drew his sword.\n\u201cHey!\u201d\nArnold locked the door from the outside. \u201cStay hidden.\u201d\nWhy is he putting himself in danger? That\u2019s what knights are for! The fact that Rishe had been about to do the same thing didn\u2019t occur to her. It\u2019s probably bandits. He told me to stay hidden in here, but I\u2019m not so sure about that.\nArnold had left her locked in from the outside, hoping to keep her safe, but Rishe didn\u2019t like her odds. There were five coaches, but this one was certainly the grandest. It locked on the inside as well, but that wouldn\u2019t stop someone with enough determination. If she did as she was told, she\u2019d just be waiting patiently for a bandit to break a window and drag her out.\nKeeping one eye on the coachmen fleeing into the forest, Rishe began a methodical search for something to help her. Right\u2014her hairpin!\nThis sure brings me back. She unfastened it, twisting it into the gap in the door. Back when I was a maid, my lady would lock herself in her",
    "query_text": " chambers all the time to avoid her studies. I had to break her out just like this.\nThe lock on the coach was simple, and it came open easily. Once she was free, she scanned her surroundings. She didn\u2019t see anyone who looked immediately hostile, but there was noise up ahead. Cautiously, she headed toward it.\nBefore long, she found Arnold.\nWow.\nRoughly ten men\u2014the bandits, she presumed\u2014"

You said you wouldn\u2019t touch me.\u201d\n\u201cThat was reflex,\u201d Arnold protested. \u201cI thought you were going to hurt yourself.\u201d\nSuch a simple conversation, so casual. It had Rishe feeling positively peculiar.\n\u201cWhy are your knights so wary around me?\u201d she asked. \n\u201cWary? Oh, they were all at the palace when you broke your first engagement. They\u2019re most likely concerned I\u2019m bringing home a villainous jilt who will lead to my ruin. Something silly like that.\u201d\n\u201cI see.\u201d Apparently, being dumped by a prince called into question one\u2019s herbalist abilities.\n\u201cI\u2019m glad you mentioned it,\u201d Arnold went on, \u201cbecause there may be people in Galkhein who will oppose our union. I will do everything in my power to protect you, but you must bring any insults or threats to me right away.\u201d\n\u201cAre there likely to be many?\u201d\n\u201cIn theory, the crown prince may choose his own wife, but the done thing is, of course, to marry a princess. I assume a duke\u2019s daughter would have at least some ties to the royal family?\u201d\nHe assumed correctly. She was in the family tree, if a rather distant branch.\n\u201cMy father has ordered me to choose a bride from a different kingdom rather than a woman of my own land because\u2014\u201d\n\u201cOne never knows when a hostage will come in handy,\u201d Rishe finished for him.\nGalkhein was an expansionist empire. Currently, peace reigned\u2014but peace was precarious. If Galkhein demanded any of the countries to hand over a princess bride, then none were in a position to refuse. With his daughter in the hands of a foreign power, no king would dare oppose a war that power cared to wage.\n\u201cI sent a message to my father telling him I happened upon a close relation of Hermity\u2019s king\u2014a duke\u2019s daughter who had been recently tossed aside by her fianc\u00e9e,\u201d Arnold said. \u201cI also may have implied I was the reason for your falling out\u2014yours and the prince\u2019s. Why, when I saw a woman so powerful and connected and beloved, I couldn\u2019t help but plunder you.\u201d\n\u201cPlunder me? That\u2019s certainly one way to describe it.\u201d Dietrich had kicked up an almighty fuss, despite being the one who broke the engagement.\n\u201cMy father approves of you because he sees you as a bargaining chip. There will be others who aren\u2019t prepared to accept you so willingly.\u201d\n\u201cIs that so?\u201d Rishe said steadily.\n\u201cNever fear,\u201d Arnold responded. \u201cThey\u2019ll eat their words, every one of them. They will receive you as their crown princess if they value their\u2014\u201d\n\u201cNo, being a hostage is perfect.\u201d \nArnold stared at her. \u201cHm?\u201d\n\u201cAs a hostage, I\u2019ll have no official duties, will I? We can pretend I\u2019m here only under great duress, and there will be no need for my comment on governmental or diplomatic affairs.\u201d\nArnold hesitated. \u201cI suppose not.\u201d\n\u201cExcellent! Then I can live my dream of being utterly useless.\u201d Rishe trembled with delight. The thought of acting as an ambassador had really been weighing on her mind. Being a princess was nonstop work. Having been groomed for the position from an early age, Rishe knew members of the royal family barely even had time to sleep.\nBut prisoners didn\u2019t have places in government.\n\u201cThis is such a weight off my mind,\u201d Rishe admitted. \u201cThank you so much for keeping your promise, Your Highness.\u201d\n\u201cEr, of course.\u201d\n\u201cBut don\u2019t worry, I won\u2019t shirk my duties as wedding planner.\u201d Nearly ready to collapse with relief, Rishe returned to her herbs.\n \n***\n \nAfter the bandit incident, Rishe felt the knights begin to ease a bit in her presence.\nDespite their initial reluctance to accept her help, they continued to report the injured men\u2019s progress and bring any concerns directly to her. In return, they took over gathering herbs from the surrounding countryside on their rest stops.\nShe hadn\u2019t done it for gratitude, but she was nonetheless touched. Gathering medicinal herbs had been second nature ever since her life as an apothecary, and it was foolish to ever turn down loyalty.\nSeveral days after the altercation with the bandits, the coach train finally arrived in the imperial capital of Galkhein.\n\u201cOh my,\u201d Rishe murmured as they passed through the gates.\nWhite stone buildings stood in straight rows, lining clean, orderly streets. The first stories all appeared to be shops, while the second-floor windows were festooned with flowers. Everywhere she looked were smiling faces, citizens turned out to witness their prince\u2019s return over the smooth brick roads. Overlooking it all was the towering magnificence of the imperial palace.\n\u201cThe capital is the seat of power in Galkhein,\u201d Arnold explained. \u201cSeveral key trade routes converge here.\u201d\nRishe nodded, suddenly anxious to be out of the coach. More and more people were gathering to watch their progress, some carrying shopping bags in both arms or holding hands with children. Many of them waved, as if greeting someone dear to them.\nHappy citizens and clean, orderly streets meant wealth. Galkhein was well-off. Rishe couldn\u2019t help but grin at an adorable little girl watching them roll by with sparkling eyes. When she saw Rishe\u2019s smile, she blushed and leapt up in the air, laughing with delight.\nThe coach made its way through the city before passing through the castle gates. Lines of disciplined knights flanked the road, ready to greet the crown prince and his fianc\u00e9e.\nArnold stepped out of the coach, holding out his hand to Rishe. She took it reflexively as she alighted. A prince would be expected to help any lady out of carriage, never mind his own consort, yet for some reason the knights looked a bit disturbed.\nRishe shot them back of look of innocent confusion.\n\u201cOur long journey is at last at its end, Your Highness, Lady Rishe.\u201d Oliver emerged from the ranks of the knights, bowing. He shot Arnold a curious glance. \u201cHow novel to see you taking the hand of your fianc\u00e9e.\u201d\nAh! Rishe realized that she herself had willingly broken the condition that she had imposed. Arnold had offered his hand, but she was the one who accepted.\nArnold gave a little laugh of triumph. Rishe felt a rush of frustration at being tricked. \nOliver stared at them before leaning in to whisper in Arnold\u2019s ear. Arnold let out a breath of annoyance. \n\u201cIs something the matter?\u201d Rishe asked.\n\u201cI sent orders ahead to have a detached wing of the palace prepared for us, but it seems the preparations are behind schedule. I\u2019m sorry, but you\u2019ll need to stay in a guest room in the main palace for a few days.\u201d\n\u201cOh, I don\u2019t mind if the wing isn\u2019t ready,\u201d Rishe said. \u201cWe can head over there now.\u201d\n\u201cIt hasn\u2019t been used in quite a while. It\u2019ll be covered in dust.\u201d\n\u201cI said that I didn\u2019t mind if it was a mess, remember? But there\u2019s no need for you to put yourself out. By all means, stay in the main palace for as long as you need.\u201d Rishe had spent a life as a maid\u2014dust didn\u2019t scare her. \u201cBesides, I\u2019m a hostage, after all.\u201d\n\u201cYou could at least attempt to sound distressed,\u201d Arnold said with the slightest trace of petulance. \nRishe, who had a huge grin spreading over her face and her chest puffed out with pride, didn\u2019t respond.\n \n***\n \nThe detached wing turned out to be just a separate palace in the distant corner of the grounds\u2014a scant four stories tall and, as advertised, absolutely swimming in dust.\nNot so bad, though. Rishe had pictured decay and clutter, but it was mostly just bare. Bare and musty, but not rotten or falling apart.\n\u201cYou can do whatever you want with this place. I\u2019ll be occupied over the next few days, but feel free to use the guest apartments in the main palace if you get tired of choking to death,\u201d Arnold said before he left.\nAccording to Oliver, work had piled up while the prince was away, and it wasn\u2019t just a few things that could be dispensed with over a few days working around the clock.\nEmperor Arnold Hein\u2026 He\u2019s just a crown prince right now, but I still wish I knew what\u2019s going on in his head. For now, I\u2019ll just focus on what I can do. Like make this place livable.\nShe changed into her plainest dress and rolled up her sleeves. The knights who\u2019d remained to serve as her guard kept watch over her as she went from window to window, throwing them all open.\nIn a stroke of luck, the weather was good, and the detached wing was well placed to soak up the sun. The lack of any creature comforts made it look ascetic and drab, but once it was furnished, Rishe had no doubt it would be lovely.\nLeaving the top floors to air out, Rishe found the stairs to the basement. She pushed the heavy wooden doors open, and mice skittered over her feet. The knights yelped as Rishe descended into the darkness.\n\u201cL-Lady Rishe, why are you going down here?\u201d\n\u201cCleaning supplies are usually kept in the basement. See?\u201d\nThe knights followed her gaze to a duster, broom, dustpan, and pile of fresh cloths. She filled a bucket with water and went to work, rolling up a handkerchief to cover her mouth as she swept dust down from high on the walls. Then she swept up all the dust on the floor.\nIt\u2019s always satisfying to tackle a place this filthy.\nShe corralled the dust bunnies until they were piled up like snow in the center of the hall, and then she swept them out the open door. Once the floors were free of debris, she attacked them with the cloth.\n\u201cLady Rishe, is there anything we can do to help?\nRishe was grateful for the knight\u2019s offer, but she shook her head. \u201cYour job is to guard me, not do my housekeeping.\u201d\n\u201cThis is quite the place to clean on your own, detached though it may be,\u201d the knight said hesitantly. \u201cIt\u2019s not too late to move into the guest chambers instead.\u201d\n\u201cThat\u2019s all right. I like the place already.\u201d\nRishe remained steadfast in her refusal for one reason: readying guest chambers was an awful chore. The palace maids would be expected to work overnight to prepare them, even if the guests were only staying a single night. No speck of dust or strand of hair could remain. Certainly no wrinkled sheets. Rishe knew how exhausting and rigorous a maid\u2019s job was, how nerve-racking.\nShe refused to put the poor dears through such an ordeal for just a few days\u2019 stay. From the sound of things, the palace wasn\u2019t equipped with many housemaids. No doubt they already had their hands full.\n\u201cBesides, take a look.\u201d She held out her arms wide, gesturing to her sparkling clean floor. The knights stared at the bright room in admiration. \u201cCleaning a place with your own hands makes living there that much more satisfying, you see.\u201d\nThe knights smiled their awkward but good-natured agreement.\nRishe worked tirelessly, and before long, the chambers where she would spend the night were ready. The knights offered to carry in the bed, which she allowed.\nWhile they brought in furniture, Rishe started cleaning another room. She had run out of clean water, so she quietly slipped out to the well without informing the knights. It wasn\u2019t quite fair to them, but these were the palace grounds. Surely she didn\u2019t need to be chaperoned everywhere.\nBesides, they\u2019re guards in name only. They\u2019re clearly just here to report my movements to Arnold Hein, Rishe reflected as she walked through a courtyard full of flowers, bucket in hand. Iridescent butterflies cavorted playfully around her feet. He doesn\u2019t seem in a hurry to introduce me to the king. Although if I\u2019m just a hostage, that doesn\u2019t surprise me.\nShe hoped she got to meet the current emperor at least once. The future Arnold\u2019s violent conquest only began after he killed the man and made himself emperor, after all.\nI wonder what happened to Arnold Hein after I died in my past life. Did he reign supreme after winning his war? Or did some country manage to put a stop to his conquest? Whatever the case, I absolutely cannot allow him to start a conflict this time. Being the empress of a wartime nation sounds like so much work! The very thought is unacceptable!\nPerhaps they could divorce, but Rishe had a feeling that if Arnold decided to discard her in the middle of a war, she would fail in her mission to make it past the age of twenty. Better to avoid the situation all together.\nWait. When she thought about it, the cause of every single one of Rishe\u2019s deaths was Arnold and his war. I died fighting. I died when Galkhein\u2019s army invaded\u2026\nLooking at her six lives, all of them had ended in more or less the same way.\nRishe found herself crouched on the ground, cradling her head in her hands. Maybe we should get a divorce right now. But it wasn\u2019t in Rishe\u2019s nature to take back her decisions once she\u2019d made them. \nIf I leave, I\u2019ll probably just die in some war-related disaster again. If I can\u2019t live apart from him, I should take this opportunity to learn everything that I can. \nRishe didn\u2019t know the cause of her repeating lives, but there was no guarantee that the loops were infinite. She had to operate under the possibility that this life could be her last. This required some thought, but standing around seething with anxiety wouldn\u2019t help.\nRight now I\u2019ll focus on cleaning. Once the bath is here, I\u2019ll scrub off all the dust and travel exhaustion. And then I can finally relax! \nBrimming with new determination, she stood up and headed for the well. She was forestalled by the sound of jeering giggles. \n\u201cAww, look at the new girl, trying so hard,\u201d said one voice.\n\u201cAll the enthusiasm in the world won\u2019t make a difference,\u201d said another. \u201cWe\u2019re going to be the crown princess\u2019s maids, not you.\u201d\nThe first added, \u201cHey, are you even listening? Stop wasting your time!\u201d\nRishe heard a weak scream, followed by a thump, like a body hitting the ground. She broke into a run, finding a blonde girl sprawled in the dirt, surrounded by four other women.\n\u201cAre you all right?\u201d Rishe hurried over to help the girl up. Her maid\u2019s uniform\u2014a loose navy-blue dress with a white apron\u2014was smeared with mud. The others were dressed identically.\n\u201cWho are you?\u201d one of the girls snapped at Rishe. She had a mop of blazing-red hair. \u201cAnother newbie?\u201d\nAn understandable mistake. Rishe\u2019s dress was simple, free of ornamentation, and her hair was bound back in a ponytail to keep it out of the way. She was dust-streaked, sweaty, and carrying a bucket in her arms.\nTelling them who I am will be more trouble than it\u2019s worth. Her silence only angered the girls more.\n\u201cAre you one of the crown princess\u2019s maids? They\u2019ve been snatching up every new girl. Those pretty hands of yours don\u2019t look like they\u2019ve ever held a broom,\u201d said one of them.\n\u201cUnfortunately for you, we\u2019ve been working here three years, and we\u2019ll be the ones to serve Prince Arnold as the maids of his palace.\u201d\n\u201cCan you stand? Oh, good, it looks like you\u2019re not injured.\u201d Rishe helped the girl up out of the dirt. \n\u201cHey, don\u2019t ignore us!\u201d the redheaded maid shouted. \u201cYou\u2019ve got some nerve. If you want to make it here, you\u2019ll know your place! I doubt the two of you will last a week!\u201d\nRishe didn\u2019t respond, her attention snagging on something else. The redhead was carrying curtains, probably to bring them to the wash. Rishe stared at them so hard the maid began to shift uncomfortably. \u201cWhat\u2019s your problem?\u201d\n\u201cYou should wait to wash those,\u201d Rishe said.\nThe girl glared daggers at her. \u201cExcuse me? Are you telling me it\u2019s too late in the day? You really are an amateur! The light lasts longer in the spring, you know. And it\u2019s hot today. There\u2019ll be plenty of\u2014\u201d \n\u201cIt\u2019s going to rain, is all.\u201d\nThe maids exchanged glances. \u201cHow can you be so sure?\u201d\n\u201cLook at the clouds amassing. The butterflies and the",
    "query_text": " bees are flying low. The moisture in the air will make the drying take longer.\u201d\n\u201cWhat?\u201d\nAnother maid spoke up in a soft voice. \u201cDiana, you were the one who said we should take the initiative to wash the bigger pieces. You said the crown prince would choose us for his household!\u201d\n\u201cStop putting the blame on me! This isn\u2019t my fault.\u201d An indignant flush crept over the redhead\u2019s face. \u201cThere\u2019s no way some upstart can tell what time it\u2019s going to rain! The weather is going to be fantastic all day. Come on, we\u2019re hauling these over to the wash!\u201d\nThe three girls meekly followed Diana.\nRishe sighed, turning to the blonde girl. \u201cAre you hurt?\u201d\n\u201cNo,"

    "prefix_text": "ly. \u201cWanted to what?\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019ve always wanted to come here.\u201d\nDuring her life as a merchant, Rishe developed her single dream to visit everywhere in the world. That dream was cut tragically short when only one country remained: Galkhein.\nIn each of her consecutive lives, Rishe\u2019s priority became staying alive. Every time, without fail, just as she found her footing, the world was plunged into chaos. She never had the chance to see Galkhein. This betrothal was her chance. \u201cIt\u2019s probably why I agreed to marry you,\u201d she added after a moment\u2019s hesitation.\nArnold swept a tepid glance over the city. \u201cThere\u2019s nothing here worth seeing.\u201d\n\u201cThat\u2019s not true! The places you just told me about sound amazing! Your citizens are clean and happy, your knights are proper and kind. Oh, and another\u2014\u201d \nRishe broke off enumerating Galkhein\u2019s charms as Arnold turned to look at her. His face was impassively calm, but something seemed to pass by underneath, like a shadow in deep water.\n\u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d Rishe said. \u201cDid I say something odd?\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m just amazed you could be so unaware of yourself.\u201d \nWh-what a rude thing to\u2014\n\u201cI\u2019ve never met anyone like you. No one has ever spoken to me the way you do. I don\u2019t know any girls of your class with the knowledge or the physical abilities you possess. Noblewomen don\u2019t concern themselves with such things.\u201d\nRishe, there is no need for you to think for yourself.\nShe frowned. \u201cPerhaps you\u2019re right, but everything I\u2019ve learned is precious to me. No one can take my skills away\u2014I value them with my life. Some may say that my knowledge is worthless, but it makes no difference to me.\u201d She turned from the balcony, fixing him with a piercing gaze. \u201cI\u2019m the one who decides what I value.\u201d\nRishe had clawed free of her mother and father\u2019s indoctrination a long time ago. Man, woman\u2014it didn\u2019t matter. She could do anything. Being queen was not the culmination of her life; she wouldn\u2019t trade her freedom for anything.\nArnold matched her intensity. \u201cYou\u2019re right.\u201d He gently cupped her cheek in a one hand, swiping his thumb along the line of her jaw, smearing dust. \u201cLive your life here however you wish. I vow to do my utmost to protect you.\u201d\n\u201cHuh?\u201d\nHis vehemence took her by surprise. Arnold had every right to demand she act the part of a proper consort. This was a political marriage; Rishe was essentially a hostage, after all. Yet here he was, cosigning her misbehavior. Moreover, he was all but swearing to defend her from the consequences.\n\u201cWhy?\u201d\n\u201cYou know why. I\u2019m enamored with you.\u201d Arnold fed her the same line. \u201cI know you said you don\u2019t care about other people\u2019s approval, but I like your asymmetrical talents. I don\u2019t find them useless at all.\u201d \nRishe didn\u2019t know how to respond.\n\u201cI thought I\u2019d already made that clear.\u201d He took his hand back, drawing away, stopping just on the threshold. He turned back to a stunned Rishe and said, \u201cLet me know if there\u2019s anything you desire. I realize I just broke our agreement\u2014the one about not touching you.\u201d\nAnd with that, he was gone.\nShaken, Rishe sank to the floor of the balcony. I can\u2019t predict him at all! Just what is Arnold Hein planning?\nThe quiet of evening fell over the imperial capital of Galkhein.\n \n***\n \n\u201cMmm.\u201d\nSunshine streamed through the window as Rishe roused from sleep. She rolled over, basking in the morning light. The wall she expected wasn\u2019t there, and the bed seemed larger than usual. Taking advantage of it, she stretched out as far as she could.\nWas this her chamber at home? Or maybe she was a merchant again, spending a night at the desert king\u2019s palace. Perhaps this was her bed of straw from her life as a maid? Her memories met and interwove as she drifted into wakefulness.\nWhen Rishe finally opened her eyes, she grew even more confused.\nLight blue curtains surrounded the bed, thin enough to allow sunlight to pass through. She pulled them aside to find herself in a bare room devoid of furniture and carpet.\nOh, right. She didn\u2019t need to report for morning training, tend to her herb garden, prepare breakfast, or see how the bottles she had brewed overnight were coming along.\nRealizing that, Rishe buried her face in the pillow. \u201cSo soft,\u201d she murmured. \nJudging by the position of the sun, it was about six o\u2019clock in the morning. She was pretty sure she had gone to bed around midnight last night.\nI slept for six whole hours? Rishe couldn\u2019t believe it. Generally, she was used to getting about four hours of sleep. On bad days, at the height of an emergency as a knight or apothecary, she wouldn\u2019t even get that much. \nI\u2019ve got nothing but cleaning on the schedule today. Hostages can sleep in, right? At least a little? Excitement suffused her at the thought,",

It\u2019s Oliver\u2014Prince Arnold\u2019s attendant.\u201d\nRishe sat up with a start. \u201cI\u2019m awake!\u201d\nOliver continued to speak through the door. \u201cI apologize for bothering you at such an early hour. I\u2019m here with a delivery.\u201d\n\u201cJust a moment!\u201d Rishe slipped out of the bed, dressed quickly, and tugged the bed\u2019s canopy closed. She opened the door to find Oliver standing in the hallway with a polite smile.\nHe apologized again. \u201cThis was the only time I could slip away from His Highness\u2019s office. I\u2019m glad to see that you\u2019re already dressed.\u201d\n\u201cNot at all.\u201d Rishe paused, stepping back to allow him inside. \u201cOh my. You look exhausted.\u201d\nOliver grimaced. \u201cIs it that obvious? We\u2019ve been climbing"

You don\u2019t need to attend, but he will. At least, I hope he will. I think I managed to convince him.\u201d\nShe sympathized with Oliver.

    "prefix_text": " different direction, using her inertia against her. Hey! As a result, Rishe twirled by herself on the spot.\nShe didn\u2019t miss a step. She turned elegantly, the hem of her dress whispering across the ballroom floor. She heard appreciative murmurs from the wallflowers lined up watching.\nDespite that, Rishe took it as a defeat. Round one to Arnold. \nSo\u2026you can think on your feet. How about this?\nArnold remained unruffled, evading her next scheme like it was nothing. He grinned down at her, his eyes shining with a dare.\nHe thinks I can\u2019t beat him. His ease vexed her, but it was his smugness that made her angry.\nShe let out a hard breath, attempting a maneuver to lure him in while turning. He leaned back, not falling for it at all.\nHe\u2019s just too good at changing his center of gravity! She kept her astonishment under wraps, but she felt it. Despite how close we\u2019re dancing, I can\u2019t throw off his timing at all. He\u2019s sidestepped all my attempts, and he takes back the lead the second I let down my guard!\nIt made her increasingly angry. She twirled and stepped as the dance dictated, all the while feeling out for moments of weakness. Arnold played along with her game, completely unruffled.\nEvery single time. I\u2019m doing my utmost to trip him up, but he doesn\u2019t even seem annoyed! At this point she\u2019d just settle for any reaction at all.\nTheir unusual dance style had gathered a crowd. Rishe paid them no mind, focused only on her goal. Then something occurred to her, and her breath caught in her throat.\nWait a minute, he has left an opening. It\u2019s the same one from before. She thought back to their fight to the death, to that moment when she had managed to draw blood. That may indeed have been his only weakness.\nIf I strike the same way\u2014huh? Before she could try, Arnold appeared to lose patience, wrapping his arm around her waist. He bent her back into a dip so deep it felt like he\u2019d pulled a carpet from under her feet. She yelped, grabbing at him reflexively, clinging tight. His big hands gripped her securely enough to mitigate the sensation of falling. Relief flooded through her, and she felt a laugh rumble against her ear.\nThe music came to an end with one last ringing note. She blinked. The dance is over?\nA hush fell over the ballroom. Then cheers broke out, followed by a round of applause.\n\u201cThat was incredible!\u201d\nThe watching nobles crowded in.\n\u201cYou two moved in such perfect harmony!\u201d\n\u201cI was on the edge of my seat. I felt like I was watching a sword duel!\u201d\n\u201cIs this a dance from Hermity? I\u2019ve never seen such steps before.\u201d\n\u201cUh, well\u2026\u201d Rishe floundered. She glanced up at Arnold, who appeared to be enjoying her struggle. She\u2019d get no help from him.\nRishe dealt with the barrage of questions as best she could, letting the crowd sweep them into the dining room, which was set up for a buffet-style meal. She made sure to greet every guest, riveting their faces into her memory.\nShe must have been acting peculiar, because Arnold eventually said, \u201cRishe, I think the wine is getting to you. Shall we get some fresh air?\u201d\nRishe hadn\u2019t touched a single drop. In fact, she\u2019d been caught up in so many conversations that she hadn\u2019t even had the chance to eat, but she had experience working on an empty stomach. She accepted Arnold\u2019s encouragement as the escape it was.\nJust when I least expect it, he\u2019ll act the gentleman. Maybe he\u2019d remembered her demand for a carefree life of doing nothing.\nRishe cast a charming look across the crowd. \u201cThank you for your consideration, Your Highness. Forgive me.\u201d She gave a polite bow before quietly slipping away. \nShe didn\u2019t head straight to the balcony but rather slowly walked around the hall. There was only so much she could find out glued to Arnold\u2019s side all night.\nI need information. Galkhein\u2019s political landscape was a mystery to me through all my past lives. I only know the rumors that made it abroad.\nAlthough she knew of Arnold\u2019s eventual patricide, she had no concept of the circumstances leading up to it. She needed a better picture of the factions and power balance inside the court. The lives these people led.\nI know better than to believe wartime gossip. This Arnold Hein is a lot different from what I\u2019d heard he was like at nineteen. He\u2019s not as diabolical as the rumors led me to believe. He likes to push, but he isn\u2019t unkind. The thought drifted across her mind, leaving her conflicted. Well, he\u2019s not unkind now. But I still don\u2019t like not knowing his motives. And he\u2019s a bit of a jerk, to be honest. \nShe tried to settle her mind and just observe. Gathering intelligence was necessary to lead a long, carefree life lazing around the palace.\nIf I recall correctly, that\u2019s Lord Hannawald. He seems to be on good terms with Count Gayle. Duke Hudemann and Duke Teinitz are having a friendly enough conversation, yet they don\u2019t seem close. Rishe ticked off the names of people she\u2019d met, committing them to memory.\nA wave of sweet perfume wafted over her. A pretty girl with soft blonde hair had appeared at her side. \u201cHow do you do, Lady Rishe? I\u2019m Cornelia Thea Toona.\u201d\nDuke Toona\u2019s family was the thirty-first house she\u2019d met tonight.\nRishe smiled graciously. \u201cRishe Irmgard Weitzner. A pleasure to meet you.\u201d\n\u201cThe pleasure is all mine.\u201d Cornelia smiled sweetly. Her eyes were big and bright, her lips full. She held a glass in each hand and offered one to Rishe. \u201cWine? I see you\u2019re empty-handed.\u201d\nA gaggle of other ladies nearby began giggling among themselves.\n\u201cHow dare she act so haughty when she\u2019s a captive. It\u2019s time for her learn just what she is. A pawn to be played and discarded.\u201d\n\u201cShe should enjoy her time on Prince Arnold\u2019s arm while she can.\u201d\n\u201cShe is from a minor nation, after all.\u201d\nAs Rishe took note of their whispers, Cornelia gazed at her with doe eyes. \u201cDoes my offering offend you in some way?\u201d\nIf I remember correctly, House Toona holds a vast territory in southern Galkhein.\nRishe held out a hand to accept the glass. \u201cHow could it? Thank you, Lady Cornelia.\u201d\nBefore Rishe could touch the glass, Cornelia gave a dramatic shout. \u201cOh dear! My hand slipped!\u201d She dropped it, quite obviously on purpose. Without thinking, Rishe grabbed her skirts and leaned back, plucking the glass out of the air with the other hand.\nCornelia let out a cry of surprise as Rishe caught the wine before any could spill. She swirled the glass and brought it to her nose to breathe in the bouquet.\nHmm\u2026 That\u2019s mashed capsicum. Where did she even get that? What a waste of perfectly good wine. And why bother spicing it enough to singe the tongue if she just planned to ruin my dress? Pick a plan, my dear.\nHiding her exasperation, Rishe smiled brightly. \u201cI\u2019ve never had a wine quite like this. What an unusual scent.\u201d\nCornelia bit her lip in frustration. Rishe beamed at her. You\u2019ve got such a pretty face, Lady Toona. Why don\u2019t you smile?\nRishe leaned in close to Cornelia. \u201cThis vintage isn\u2019t available where I\u2019m from. I\u2019m ever so anxious to learn more. Should I perhaps invite Prince Arnold over to enjoy a glass? Which tray did you get this from?\u201d\n\u201cWhat? Oh, um\u2026\u201d Rishe had a policy of never backing down from a fight, but it seemed Cornelia didn\u2019t share it. \u201cS-sorry, but I don\u2019t remember. Such a large hall, you see.\u201d\n\u201cA shame. I\u2019ll just give His Highness this one, then. I\u2019ll be sure to let him know who it\u2019s from.\u201d\n\u201cUh, wait!\u201d Cornelia rapidly shook her head. \u201cI-I got that glass for you, so I think you should\u2014you know what? Never mind! Maybe I should just take that\u2014oh no!\u201d\nRishe ignored the ashen-faced Cornelia, raising the glass and swallowing down a gulp. \n\u201cI-I can\u2019t believe\u2026\u201d\n\u201cSuch a spicy flavor, just as I imagined.\u201d Rishe smiled again to the assembled group\u2019s astonishment. \u201cWhat a warm welcome. I do hope the two of us can spend more time together. Perhaps\u2026a tea party?\u201d\n\u201cTh-the two of us?\u201d Cornelia stammered.\n\u201cYes. I want to know all about House Toona.\u201d\nCornelia looked flabbergasted, but she recovered herself and nodded.\nThat should do. One of Rishe\u2019s eventual plans required a plot of land in a temperate climate. House Toona\u2019s would likely be perfect, but she needed to confirm a few things with Cornelia. Never back down from a fight. Even further\u2026\nShe recalled the words of her mentor from her days as a merchant.\nDon\u2019t bother with fights you can\u2019t win.\nThe other ladies fled, fearful of this strange girl who gulped down painfully spicy wine like it was nothing. \n \n***\n \nRishe retreated to the empty balcony to enjoy the music, grimacing with every stinging mouthful of wine. She drank it in decreasing sips until Arnold joined her.\n\u201cWhat are you making that face for?\u201d\nRishe swirled the glass. \u201cDon\u2019t worry, it\u2019s not you. It\u2019s just this wine is so spicy.\u201d\n\u201cSpicy? The wine is?\u201d\n\u201cMm. It\u2019s seasoned with capsicum. I barely managed to get that first mouthful down without gagging.\u201d\nArnold swiped the glass from her hand. \u201cDon\u2019t tell me this was a poisoning attempt!\u201d\nRishe clicked her tongue in annoyance at her own lack of vigilance. No one else would be able to grab something from her so easily.\nArnold glared at the wine. \u201cYou don\u2019t need to drink this. I\u2019ll get rid of it.\u201d\n\u201cHey, give that back! They ruined a perfectly good glass of wine because of me. I\u2019m not going to waste it.\u201d She grabbed it back and took another sip, shuddering at the taste.\nArnold glowered. \u201cTell me who did this. I\u2019ll have them executed.\u201d\n\u201cDon\u2019t be ridiculous. You don\u2019t kill people like her\u2014you use them.\u201d Just the tiniest bit of wine to go, but it was getting harder to make herself drink it. She gave the glass a reproachful look, then glanced back at Arnold. \u201cOh, and I owe you an apology.\u201d\n\u201cDo you?\u201d\n\u201cI used your name to defend myself.\u201d The girls had only backed off when she threatened to tattle to Arnold. Rishe found that sort of thing inelegant in the extreme, and she was embarrassed.\nArnold sighed at Rishe\u2019s apologetic bow. \u201cThere\u2019s nothing wrong with a wife invoking her husband\u2019s name.\u201d\nRishe hesitated. \u201cWe\u2019re not married yet.\u201d\n\u201cThat\u2019s a formality. It\u2019s as good as done, if you ask me.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2026see.\u201d\nHe took her distraction as an opportunity to swipe her glass back. Instead of dumping it out, Arnold gulped the rest of it down. \n\u201cDamn, that packs a punch,\u201d he grumbled.\n\u201cI told you that!\u201d Rishe snapped. \u201cAre you all right? Let me get you some water!\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m fine. But now you\u2019ve fulfilled your obligation to the wine, haven\u2019t you?\u201d\nRishe didn\u2019t know what to say. He\u2019d helped her\u2014not by taking charge but by following her lead. Without cutting her down and telling her she was being foolish. Without rolling his eyes and dismissing her desires as trifles.\n\u201cThank you,\u201d Rishe said stiffly, which just made him laugh.\n\u201cWhat were you thinking about when we were dancing?\u201d he asked.\n\u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d\n\u201cYou were thinking about someone else, weren\u2019t you? Who?\u201d\nRishe didn\u2019t know a delicate way to say I was thinking about a future version of you I met in another life.\n\u201cHmm?\u201d His tone was oddly light, teasing even. But the gleam in his hunter\u2019s eyes said she wouldn\u2019t get away so easily.\nObviously, Rishe couldn\u2019t give him an honest answer. \u201cI wasn\u2019t thinking about anyone else. I was worried about you.\u201d\n\u201cWhy?\u201d\nThis was the closest she could come to the truth. \u201cWere you injured here?\u201d She patted her own left shoulder with her forefinger. \nArnold went silent. His left shoulder was slightly slower to react than his right\u2014if his right was at one hundred, then his left was at maybe ninety-eight. It was hardly noticeable, but Rishe had picked up on it. He was right-handed, and she wouldn\u2019t have noticed it if they\u2019d been dancing normally. \nThat, and if it hadn\u2019t been for memories from her past life.\nRishe had only managed to inflict a single injury on him. An instant, a moment\u2019s hesitation where she saw her chance and slashed left. Of course, he\u2019d shrugged off the injury and effortlessly run her through. \n\u201cHeh.\u201d Arnold finally broke his silence with grim laughter. His eyes sent shivers down her spine, cold and bewitching. In lieu of an answer, he reached for his collar, unfastening the clasp with a snap and drawing his jacket open with a rough tug.\nOh my.\nRishe drew in a breath. A great scar was engraved into the nape of his neck, just low enough to be concealed by clothing. It looked several years old. \u201cIt\u2019s an old wound. It continues to the top of my shoulder and pulls the skin taut.\u201d\n\u201cHow awful.\u201d Rishe couldn\u2019t help but reach out to gingerly touch the nape of his neck.\nArnold accepted her touch without a word. She\u2019d half expected to be slapped aside.\nHer fingers slowly traced the shape of it. She could feel the rough skin through her gloves.\nHe must have gotten this over a decade ago. Someone stabbed him\u2014and not just once or twice. They must have done it over and over to make this scar pattern.\nHer medical training had her shuddering at the image of a nine-year-old Arnold ashen and trembling with blood loss. The fact that he\u2019d survived and retained the use of his arm was incredible. And then to go on to wield a sword so skillfully\u2014his suffering must have been immense.\n\u201cOnly a few people know about this injury. You\u2019re the first to notice on your own.\u201d\n\u201cHow did it happen?\u201d\nThat grim smile returned as he looked down at Rishe. With the moon hanging behind him, he was as opaque as ever, but Rishe understood the sentiment.\nI shouldn\u2019t pry.\nRishe pulled her hand away, and that ominous smile that sent chills down her spine disappeared. Arnold put his jacket back in order, reclasping it at the neck.\nSomeone tried to kill Arnold Hein about ten years ago. But who and why? Rishe cast her eyes down as she ruminated. The most obvious beneficiaries of a dead crown prince would be potential heirs and those loyal to them. I believe Arnold has a younger brother, but I haven\u2019t met him yet.\nOdd. Rishe might be a hostage, but shouldn\u2019t she meet her future relatives? Perhaps it was Arnold\u2019s doing and not the will of the imperial family themselves. He didn\u2019t seem to want to involve her in anything unless it was absolutely necessary\u2014he hadn\u2019t told her about this ball, after all. \nRishe looked up at him. \u201cYour Highness, may I select my maids some time over the next few days?\u201d \n\u201cVery well. I\u2019ll tell Oliver to make that a priority.\u201d\n\u201cAh, I can do the selection myself. We needn\u2019t trouble him.\u201d\nArnold arched an amused brow. Gone was that unsettling smile, replaced with his easy manner. \u201cWhat are you planning this time?\u201d\n\u201cOh, nothing important,\u201d Rishe said. She picked up her empty glass. \u201cI\u2019m merely concerned about the servants\u2019 working conditions.\u201d\nTo protect her life and well-being, she needed to keep from dying at twenty years old again.

Did you just say something?\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s soap. The same kind we always use.\u201d Diana was sure of it.\nThe princess said, \u201cPlease rise.\u201d \nWhy did her voice sound so familiar? An incredible foreboding gripping her, Diana looked up. She gasped.\n\u201cMy name is Rishe Irmgard Weitzner.\u201d\nBefore her stood the beautiful newcomer\u2014the thorn in her side for the past few days. The smile she wore was peaceful and just the slightest bit satisfied.\n \n***\n \nI\u2019m so glad I managed to finish washing the sheets in time!\nStanding before the maids with Arnold\u2019s attendant Oliver at her side, Rishe was panicking on the inside. She\u2019d had so much to do this morning that she\u2019d put off the laundry to the last minute. She took deep, controlled breaths, praying no one would notice that she\u2019d raced here at a dead sprint.\nOliver was none the wiser as he spoke to the assembled girls. Rishe took the opportunity to look them over. She locked eyes with Elsie, who was gaping at her. It was a nice change\u2014usually her face was as blank as a rock wall.\nI\u2019m sorry for the deception. I figured blending in would give me the best picture of your working conditions.\nThe new maids wore similarly shocked expressions, while others watched her with delight. Meanwhile, the veterans, including Diana, had all gone pale. They trembled, stunned into silence. One seemed locked in a terrifying trance, while another looked on the verge of tears. All of them had spoken to Rishe with derision. As the ringleader, Diana was covering her mouth with both hands, like she was holding in a scream.\nOliver had finished his introduction. \u201cYour Highness, if you would?\u201d\nRishe stepped forward. \u201cFirst, I must apologize to you for what has transpired prior to this meeting. My deception, that is. However, it has granted me insight into how each one of you works.\u201d\nOliver\u2019s face creased in confusion. The newcomer maids began to panic, whispering among themselves.\n\u201cDoesn\u2019t this mean that she helped us out with the laundry?\u201d\n\u201cWe\u2019re going to be fired!\u201d\n\u201cIf I lose my position, my brother will have to quit school!\u201d\nNoticing the commotion, Oliver glanced at Rishe. \u201cYour Highness, two-thirds of these maids are newly recruited from the city. Since the majority of the castle maids were elderly, His Highness assumed you would prefer maids closer in age to yourself.\u201d\nRishe was startled. She had found it odd that most of her potential servants were new hires, but she hadn\u2019t expected this to be the reason.\n\u201cWhile the prince has entrusted the selection of your maids to you,\u201d Oliver went on. \u201cHiring someone with no experience will not do. Despite Prince Arnold\u2019s views, I urge you to reject the newcomers.\u201d\n\u201cOliver.\u201d\n\u201cI have a list of their names here. Elsie\u2014\u201d\n\u201cElsie, Nichole, Hilde, Marguerite, Rosa.\u201d Rishe began listing the names of the newly recruited maids. She\u2019d made a point to memorize them in the washhouse. \u201cElke, Amelia, and\u2014\u201d\nOliver looked at her wildly. \u201cYou know them all?! Even though they\u2019ve never served you in the past?\u201d\n\u201cYes, of course I do. Servants are essential to the maintenance of our lifestyle, why wouldn\u2019t I get to know them?\u201d Rishe listed the remaining names for good measure. \u201cAll twenty of you, listen to me.\u201d \nThe new maids stiffened. Diana and the other maids whose names hadn\u2019t been called were getting their wind back, wearing increasingly triumphant looks.\nRishe said, \u201cThe twenty names I just called will be my maids.\u201d\nTime seemed to stand still a moment, and then Oliver broke in with an astonished, \u201cB-but, my lady! They are all inexperienced\u2014\u201d\n\u201cYes. And my palace will be the perfect place to learn.\u201d\nThe new recruits were completely speechless, unsure of exactly what was happening. \nRishe smiled at Elsie. \u201cI hope you\u2019ll serve me well, Elsie.\u201d\nElsie was still frozen in place. \u201cHuh? Y-yes, my lady, but\u2014\u201d\nA shaking Diana cried out, \u201cBut why, my lady?! You\u2019ve seen their work! They\u2019re useless, the lot of them! The rest of us get so much more done in a shorter amount of time!\u201d\n\u201cWatch your tongue, girl,\u201d Oliver said sharply.\nDiana ignored him. \u201cWe\u2019re hard workers! Any job you assign us, we can do it! Please, I beg you, my lady!\u201d\n\u201cStep back,\u201d Oliver warned. \u201cDo not take a single step closer to Lady Rishe.\u201d\nDiana spoke in a rush, words pouring out of her. \u201cI-I freely admit that I was impolite before, but I didn\u2019t know who she was! I\u2019ll take any punishment, so please, give me the chance to show you how well I can work!\u201d\nRishe said, \u201cDiana, I have a request.\u201d\n\u201cTh-thank you, my lady!\u201d Diana heaved a sigh of relief. \u201cYou mean you\u2019ll\u2014\u201d \nRishe cut across her. \u201cAs of today, you are no longer a maid in this palace.\u201d \n\u201cWhat?\u201d Her face, usually so fixed with determination, paled. \u201cBut why? I\u2019m so much better than any of them! I\u2019ll do a perfect job no matter what task you set before me. Please don\u2019t dismiss me, my lady!\u201d \n\u201cListen to me, Diana.\u201d Rishe dropped her lofty tone, speaking as one woman would to another. \u201cYou have noticed it, haven\u2019t you? No matter what you claim, these new girls aren\u2019t worthless.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2026I don\u2019t understand.\u201d\n\u201cCan you remember your first month in service? How difficult it was?\u201d\nDiana looked completely bewildered. Her gaze darted around as if looking for help.\nPulling herself together, she forced herself to follow Rishe\u2019s directions. She thought back and finally alighted on a response. \u201cI\u2026I didn\u2019t know how to do the job. Before, when my family was still prominent, I\u2019d washed shirts and bedsheets. Never gowns or military uniforms.\u201d\n\u201cPerfectly reasonable,\u201d Rishe said. \u201cOnly natural for someone just starting out.\u201d\n\u201cThe older girls were so busy, they told me to just watch them since they didn\u2019t have time to teach me. When I had questions\u2026well, there was nobody to ask.\u201d\n\u201cI bet. And did you have any other problems?\u201d\n\u201cWell, yes. There was a lot to learn. Different kinds of soap and washboards depending on the cloth. You use different tools for different materials. I had to learn how they worked and how to put them away. I was\u2026punished if I didn\u2019t get it right the first time.\u201d\nThe newcomers were exchanging surprised looks. Rishe understood why.\nEverything Diana said was familiar to them. They spent valuable time searching for their materials and the proper ways to use them, but they shrank from asking for help. Everyone always looked so busy. This was a universal problem.\n\u201cDespite all that, I got better!\u201d Diana protested. \u201cI only needed to be taught once. Unlike them! They\u2019re useless!\u201d\n\u201cYes, well. There\u2019s a difference between you and them,\u201d Rishe told Diana. \u201cYou can read and write.\u201d\n\u201cOh!\u201d Diana started in surprise. Elsie looked at the floor.\nThe literacy rate among commoners was low no matter where you went. Very few families had the means to afford an education, especially for daughters. Diana had been born to a merchant\u2019s family\u2014she\u2019d received formal schooling. The maids she was close friends with were likely from similar backgrounds. The majority of those in service were not so fortunate.\n\u201cWhat if you only received instructions on how to do a job once and weren\u2019t able to write it down to remind yourself later?\u201d Rishe asked. \u201cWould you be so confident?\u201d\n\u201cI-I don\u2019t\u2014\u201d Diana reflexively thrust a hand into her apron pocket, where she had a list of daily tasks recorded in her neat handwriting to reference throughout the day. Hopefully now she would understand how much of an edge her privileged literacy gave her over the other maids.\n\u201cEveryone else works as hard as they can, just like you do,\u201d Rishe said. \u201cRemember how it was for you at first? They all have to start somewhere. I hope you\u2019ll keep that in mind.\u201d\n\u201cThey\u2019re no different from me,\u201d Diana mumbled begrudgingly, gl",

    "prefix_text": " that, Rishe turned and fled.\nThis unexpected run-in with Arnold had taken up valuable time. She threw open the door to the balcony and hiked up her skirts, kicking off her shoes in anticipation of jumping into a tree. Looking down, she realized the ground was far closer than she\u2019d feared.\nExcellent! I can just drop into the garden!\nArnold, who up until now had been rendered speechless, shook himself out of his fugue as Rishe clambered over the railing. \u201cHey!\u201d\nRishe\u2019s moonlight-silver dress flowed around her as she leapt. The lawn was soft, but the fall was still far enough to risk injury.\nWeight evenly distributed on the soles of my feet, roll to transfer the impact to my shins and thighs, then onto my hips and my back.\nShe landed safely, rolled nimbly in her dress, and popped back up. Her hair was covered in leaves. \nI need to hurry up!\nBracing against a nearby rock, she used her weight to snap the heels off of her shoes. There. That would make running a little easier. Satisfied, she slipped them back on and made haste toward the family estate. \n \n***\n \nUp on the balcony, Crown Prince Arnold of Galkhein watched the spectacle play out from beginning to end. He gazed at the girl with the coral hair. Her appearance was that of any young noblewoman, but she moved like a well-trained knight. She\u2019d leapt from the balcony and landed skillfully, showing no signs of distress at her ripped dress or disheveled hair. Instead, she\u2019d knocked the heels off her shoes and dashed away.\nAlso, she had called him an emperor.\nPlaying it all over again in his head, Arnold broke out into a rare chuckle. As his shoulders quivered with laughter, his attendant approached him from behind.\n\u201cThere you are, Your Highness. What are you doing out here? I\u2019m aware you don\u2019t desire a wife, but beginning the search would be wise\u2026 Er, Your Highness?\u201d The attendant\u2019s eyes flew wide. His bored and scowling master was laughing. \u201cDid something happen?\u201d\n\u201cOliver, ready my coach. Wait, no. That will take too much time. Bring me a horse.\u201d\n\u201cAt once, Your Highness. Might I ask why?\u201d\nArnold didn\u2019t respond\u2014he just grinned like a hungry wolf catching scent of his prey.\n \n***\n \nOnce outside the palace gates, Rishe threw herself into the waiting coach, shouting for the driver to make haste. She stopped it a few hundred yards from the manor and bid him farewell. \u201cI\u2019m leaving! Thanks for always being such a safe driver, Daniel!\u201d\nThe road to the manor was muddy from a morning rain shower. She knew from her second life that the coach would get stuck, resulting in a loss of valuable time. It was better to just get out and run. \n\u201cHuff, huff.\u201d Despite her last life\u2019s physical conditioning, this body had no stamina. She\u2019d need to try to get fitter faster this time around.\nRishe reached the end of the road, and her heart promptly sank all the way to her feet. \u201cOh no.\u201d\nThe front door was thronged with people, all of them surrounding a carriage bearing the royal family\u2019s coat of arms.\nI need to get out of here.\nWhile she stood frozen in indecision, one of the knights doing crowd control shouted, \u201cYour Highness! I have eyes on Lady Rishe!\u201d\n\u201cGet out of my way!\u201d A familiar voice started up a bellow. \u201cLet me through! Rishe, how dare you make me wait so long?\u201d\nRishe\u2019s ex-fianc\u00e9, Crown Prince Dietrich, stepped triumphantly forward.\n\u201cI know the thought of hearing your crimes enumerated by the man you love must pain you, but alas, as future king, it is my duty to bring down the hammer of justice upon a villainess such as yourself!\u201d\n\u201cI see I\u2019ve timed it badly,\u201d Rishe muttered. \u201cIn fact, this is my worst loop yet. I\u2019d rather be barred from the house than see you again.\u201d\n\u201cHmm? What are you grumbling about?\u201d Dietrich looked Rishe up and down. \u201cI knew it. You put on a brave face, but I can sense the sorrow in your heart.\u201d\n\u201cI beg your pardon?\u201d\n\u201cYour heart!\u201d the prince repeated. \u201cYour heart! It must be absolutely crushed!

Possibly the same place he mined for all his bottomless self-confidence.\n\u201cI can tell you\u2019ve been wandering aimlessly, distraught,\u201d the prince went on. \u201cLook at you. Your dress is caked in mud, your shoes are broken, and there are cuts marring your face and arms. What other possible cause could there be than heartbreak?\u201d\nRishe narrowed her eyes. \u201cDo you ever stop to think about the words coming out of your mouth?\u201d\n\u201cWhat?\u201d\nHis interpretation of events was fanciful to the point of absurdity. \u201cI did not dirty my dress or snap my shoes out of heartbreak.

Rishe felt dizzy at the sight of this abject debasement in the presence of citizens.\nArnold, who had been watching the proceedings with a detached amusement, sobered and stepped toward the king. \u201cYour Majesty, please rise.\u201d\nWithout the smirk, Arnold\u2019s face immediately reverted to its cold mask. The king didn\u2019t move. Maybe something in Arnold\u2019s voice kept him frozen.\n\u201cSuch a trifle won\u2019t cause discord between our kingdoms,\u201d he went on. \u201cHowever, I would beg a little time to speak with Lady Rishe.\u201d\nLater, Rishe would learn that Arnold\u2019s attendant had spoken to the king\u2019s own gentleman, certain that his words would reach their target. \u201cMy master took such trouble to attend these festivities, and this is the welcome he is offered? I wonder, what will the emperor think when he learns of his son\u2019s slighting at your nation\u2019s hands?\u201d\n\u201cIf you would, Lady Rishe?\u201d The plump king looked to be on the verge of tears.\nRishe had no obligation to accept and no desire to spend a moment longer in this country than was absolutely necessary. But acquiescence seemed the fastest way to move things along.\nAs her mind whirled, Arnold leaned in to whisper, \u201cIf you refuse to hear my suit, you won\u2019t deter me. I\u2019ll simply move on to Plan B.\u201d\nAnd that was how she found herself in one of the palace\u2019s parlors, here to \u201cjust talk\u201d to Prince Arnold. The ball guests were all gone. It was just the two of them.\n\u201cI want to know what you\u2019re planning,\u201d Rishe said flatly.\n\u201cPlanning? Me?\u201d\n\u201cBy asking me to marry you. You don\u2019t know me. A proposal like this wouldn\u2019t come out of the blue.\u201d\nThis man was destined to become an aggressive warmonger over the next few years. He wouldn\u2019t do anything without a dozen motives.\nPrince Arnold just smiled. \u201cI have no plans. I\u2019m simply enamored with you.\u201d\n\u201cEnamored\u2026?\u201d\nThat was the last thing she\u2019d expected him to say. Asking him to elaborate didn\u2019t seem worth the breath\u2014he was obviously lying. As if this ruthless, inhuman creature with ice in his veins could feel even a flicker of affection.\n\u201cWhy refuse me?\u201d Arnold asked. \u201cYour engagement is broken, you\u2019re on the verge of exile, and you have no faction or supporters. At this rate, you\u2019ll be dead within a fortnight. I\u2019d call my offer a stroke of unbelievable fortune.\u201d\n\u201cYou\u2019re not wrong,\u201d Rishe admitted. \u201cOnce upon a time, I would have jumped at your offer.\u201d\nIf it had been made in her first life, for instance. But now Rishe knew better. Her life was only just getting started, and the future held endless possibilities. After the horror of her sixth loop, she yearned for freedom.\nI don\u2019t want to marry him. I won\u2019t be anyone\u2019s captive. Still\u2026\nRishe, more than anyone, knew that the slightest adjustment could enact profound changes on the trajectory of a life. No doubt she\u2019d have many more lives, but this could be the only one where marriage to Arnold would be an option.\nThe dread emperor. The tyrant. The man who will stoke the fires of war. \nRishe knew the gossip, the endless conjecture behind Arnold Hein\u2019s bloody reign, but she didn\u2019t know the truth.\nWhy? The question had haunted her since her first life. She\u2019d never before had the chance to even speak to him.\nShe had wondered it as a merchant, hearing of the distant outbreak of war. She\u2019d wondered when the news of the dead and dying reached her apothecary. When she had comforted her terrified mistress in her life as a maid, assuring her everything would be all right. When she squared off against him in battle, as he plunged a sword through her heart\u2014even then she wondered. \nIf I stick around, maybe I\u2019ll finally have my answer. Half of her was dying to know. The other half didn\u2019t give a damn. And yet\u2026\nShe recalled a childhood dream. Rather, a longing.\nRishe let out a breath. \u201cYou claim you are enamored with me.\u201d\n\u201cYes. I am completely under your spell.\u201d\nTo think he could spout such nonsense with a straight face!\n\u201cThen will you grant me anything I desire?\u201d\n\u201cSo long as it is within my power,\u201d Arnold said. \u201cAnything you want will be yours.\u201d\nRishe hesitated, gathering her thoughts. \u201cI have some conditions.\u201d Arnold silently motioned for her to go on. \u201cI want full control over the wedding festivities. Everything must be procured through merchants of my choosing.\u201d\n\u201cFine.\u201d Arnold nodded. \u201cYou\u2019re free to do business with whomever you wish.\u201d\n\u201cAfter we are married, I must be in a position to mingle with guests from abroad.\u201d\n\u201cThat sounds within the purview of the crown princess. Anything else?\u201d\n\u201cI will be allowed to live in a separate residence from your mother and father.\u201d\nShe meant this seriously, but it made Arnold laugh. \u201cYou don\u2019t seem the type to worry about an overbearing mother-in-law.\u201d\n\u201cYou would be surprised. Combative relationships with one\u2019s new family are the most difficult part of marriage, or so they say. It could be a ramshackle cottage for all I care\u2014I just require a secondary residence.\u201d\nActually, Rishe didn\u2019t care at all about in-laws. When Arnold set his war into motion, his first move would be the assassination of his father. A genuine coup by patricide, not at all like Dietrich\u2019s clumsy attempt. Next, he would name himself emperor, take control of the country, and mobilize the military.\nSeparating him from his parents will make the first step more difficult\u2014although not impossible, unfortunately.\n\u201cAnything else?\u201d Arnold asked. \u201cI\u2019ll do whatever it takes to marry you.\u201d\n\u201cIdeally, I\u2019d like to know your endgame,\u201d Rishe said with dignity. \u201cBut as I doubt there\u2019s any chance of that, I have one final request.\u201d She jabbed a finger into his face, regardless of how rude it was. \u201cI will spend my time idling around the castle. No work, no study. I shall be utterly useless.\u201d\nLet\u2019s see just how much you want me as your princess.\nAfter a long moment of silence, Arnold cracked a merry laugh.

She wrapped them all up in a handkerchief.\nIn the meantime, Arnold dispatched a messenger to this region\u2019s lord, making arrangements to deliver the apprehended bandits. After coordinating with Oliver, he drifted over to Rishe.\n\u201cI see your interest in flowers is mercenary, rather than ornamental,\u201d he said, surveying the heaps of herbs gathered on the bank of the pond. He sat down beside her.\nWhen he didn\u2019t say anything more, Rishe went back to work plucking leaves from plants with valuable stems. The leaves had no medicinal effects, but they did make a decent broth. Slumber mushroom spores were a nuisance unless dried; they were spread out beside her in the sun.\nI wonder, would he be annoyed if I attached herbs to the roof of the coach? That would be unusual adornment for a crown prince\u2019s retinue, but it wouldn\u2019t hurt to ask.\nShe realized, quite suddenly, that Arnold was looking at her. At her hands, specifically. He sat cross-legged with his chin propped on his fist, staring absently, like a kid watching a column of ants march by.\nWhat is so fascinating about herbs?\nTheir eyes met. \u201cAm I bothering you?\u201d he asked.\nRishe shook her head slowly. \u201cNot at all. I was just curious what caught your eye.\u201d\n\u201cNothing specific. I was just thinking how very unusual you are.\u201d He was smiling again. \u201cI\u2019m looking forward to how you\u2019ll surprise me next.\u201d\nLike I\u2019m some sort of rare pet he bought to entertain him. She didn\u2019t like that. Nothing she\u2019d done was at all remarkable\u2014normal tasks performed by a normal person.\n\u201cI didn\u2019t make that antidote for your amusement.\u201d\n\u201cI realize that.\u201d The instigating smile faded from his lips. \u201cYou know, those knights you coerced into taking your home-brewed medicine were all born in the slums.\u201d\n\u201cCoerced? That\u2019s hardly the word I\u2019d use.\u201d\n\u201cGalkhein claims to value merit above all else, but in the end, people are judged by where they came from. Despite this, those men fought their way up from nothing.\u201d\nRishe paused in plucking the seeds from a flower and looked up at Arnold.\n\u201cThe men with the worst cases of the paralysis were all newly assigned. They\u2019ve spent weeks training to ensure this mission was a success. That older knight\u2014the one who bowed to you\u2014sustained an injury protecting the rookies. He cares deeply about his men.\u201d\n\u201cYou seem to care about them too,\u201d Rishe commented.\n\u201cI handpicked them for my retinue.\u201d Arnold clambered to his feet, only to fall into a bow. \u201cAnd you kept them safe. You have my deepest gratitude.\u201d\nRishe found herself at a loss for words. Was this Arnold putting on a mask to hide the monster within? Or was this the real him? She remembered the way he\u2019d looked when he held his blade to the bandit\u2019s throat, like a child poised to break a toy he had grown bored of.\n\u201cDon\u2019t mention it,\u201d Rishe said, uncomfortable. \u201cI knew how to do it, so I did.\u201d\nArnold laughed softly. \u201cBe that as it may, I\u2019d still count a noblewoman who can brew remedies from wildflowers by the side of the road a rare find.\u201d\n\u201cEarlier, when you grabbed my wrist\u2026\u201d Rishe steered the subject away from her incongruous knowledge. \u201cYou broke your promise. You said you wouldn\u2019t touch me.\u201d\n\u201cThat was reflex,\u201d Arnold protested. \u201cI thought you were going to hurt yourself.\u201d\nSuch a simple conversation, so casual. It had Rishe feeling positively peculiar.\n\u201cWhy are your knights so wary around me?\u201d she asked. \n\u201cWary? Oh, they were all at the palace when you broke your first engagement. They\u2019re most likely concerned I\u2019m bringing home a villainous jilt who will lead to my ruin. Something silly like that.\u201d\n\u201cI see.\u201d Apparently, being dumped by a prince called into question one\u2019s herbalist abilities.\n\u201cI\u2019m glad you mentioned it,\u201d Arnold went on, \u201cbecause there may be people in Galkhein who will oppose our union. I will do everything in my power to protect you, but you must bring any insults or threats to me right away.\u201d\n\u201cAre there likely to be many?\u201d\n\u201cIn theory, the crown prince may choose his own wife, but the done thing is, of course, to marry a princess. I assume a duke\u2019s daughter would have at least some ties to the royal family?\u201d\nHe assumed correctly. She was in the family tree, if a rather distant branch.\n\u201cMy father has ordered me to choose a bride from a different kingdom rather than a woman of my own land because\u2014\u201d\n\u201cOne never knows when a hostage will come in handy,\u201d Rishe finished for him.\nGalkhein was an expansionist empire. Currently, peace reigned\u2014but peace was precarious. If Galkhein demanded any of the countries to hand over a princess bride, then none were in a position to refuse. With his daughter in the hands of a foreign power, no king would dare oppose a war that power cared to wage.\n\u201cI sent a message to my father telling him I happened upon a close relation of Hermity\u2019s king\u2014a duke\u2019s daughter who had been recently tossed aside by her fianc\u00e9e,\u201d Arnold said. \u201cI also may have implied I was the reason for your falling out\u2014yours and the prince\u2019s. Why, when I saw a woman so powerful and connected and beloved, I",

That\u2019s certainly one way to describe it.\u201d Dietrich had kicked up an almighty fuss, despite being the one who broke the engagement.\n\u201cMy father approves of you because he sees you as a bargaining chip. There will be others who aren\u2019t prepared to accept you so willingly.\u201d\n\u201cIs that so?\u201d Rishe said steadily.\n\u201cNever fear,\u201d Arnold responded. \u201cThey\u2019ll eat their words, every one of them. They will receive you as their crown princess if they value their\u2014\u201d\n\u201cNo, being a hostage is perfect.\u201d \nArnold stared at her. \u201cHm?\u201d\n\u201cAs a hostage, I\u2019ll have no official duties, will I? We can pretend I\u2019m here only under great duress, and there will be no need for my comment on governmental or diplomatic affairs.\u201d\nArnold hesitated. \u201cI suppose not.\u201d\n\u201cExcellent! Then I can live my dream of being utterly useless.\u201d Rishe"

You\u2019re smart, but all the thinking in the world won\u2019t do a woman any good. You need only concern yourself with how best to serve the crown prince.\u201d\n\u201cStudies? Focus on social etiquette\u2014that\u2019s what you need for navigating high society. The crown prince\u2019s bride must be flawless. Your smile is lacking. You must always strive to appear amiable.\u201d\nRishe breathed out a long sigh. When I was fifteen, their lectures were the only thing I thought about.\nHer parents preached constantly. \u201cA woman\u2019s true happiness is to marry a suitable man and give birth to his heirs.\u201d\n\u201cBut, Mother\u2026\u201d\nObjection was not permitted. Any argument was immediately dispensed with. As a woman, Rishe could not inherit her father\u2019s title. Her only value was in her marriage. \nDespite knowing now that the opinions of others were as worthless as empty titles, the words still echoed in her memories.\nRishe\u2019s fingertips twitched, and she opened her eyes. Unmoving, she said, \u201cShouldn\u2019t you be seeing to your duties?\u201d\n\u201cMore hidden depths, I see,\u201d came a voice tinged with pleasure. Rishe straightened and turned. There was Arnold, leaning against the door to the balcony. \u201cYou seem able to sense my approach no matter how far or how hard I try.\u201d\n\u201cYou\u2019re quite naughty, aren\u2019t you? You\u2019ve been making your presence known little by little, emanating threat, to see how quickly I catch on.\u201d\n\u201cSo you noticed that as well.\u201d Arnold joined Rishe on the balcony. She tensed, but all he did was cast a curious glance at the view. \u201cWhat were you looking at?\u201d\n\u201cThe city.\u201d Rishe was hardly going to tell him she\u2019d been looking at nothing, merely ruminating on her mother\u2019s overbearing advice. The view from the balcony was spectacular, though. \u201cWhat\u2019s that over there?\u201d\n\u201cYou mean the library? The state invested funds to expand it. We have books from all over the world.\u201d\n\u201cReally? You have a library that big?\u201d Rishe\u2019s eyes sparkled with delight. She pointed out another building. \u201cWhat about that spire? It\u2019s beautiful.\u201d\n\u201cThe church and clock tower. The bells ring out the hour.\u201d\n\u201cOoh, how wonderful! And it looks like there\u2019s a rather big market there too?\u201d\n\u201cYes, the largest market in the city. Carts line up in the early morning. Most of the offerings are made fresh every day.\u201d\n\u201cAmazing! And what about that pretty mountain over there?\u201d\nRishe tried and failed to contain her excitement. She couldn\u2019t help but imagine what seeing all these places up close would be like. The grand library, the beautiful church that told the time, and the morning market with fresh, delicious food\u2014she wanted to experience it all.\nSeeing Arnold\u2019s bemused face, she said, \u201cWhat?\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m just wondering where all this interest is coming from,\u201d he said. \u201cYou were so reluctant to come, yet here you are, brimming with curiosity for my city.\u201d\n\u201cWell\u2026\u201d she trailed off, unsure of how to respond.\nWhat should I say? Should I just tell him the truth?\nThis wasn\u2019t a secret, but talking about her hopes and dreams to the man who had killed her was a little awkward. A strange self-consciousness settled on her, her cheeks heating as she mumbled, \u201cBecause I\u2019ve always wanted to.\u201d\nArnold looked at her keenly. \u201cWanted to what?\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019ve always wanted to come here.\u201d\nDuring her life as a merchant, Rishe developed her single dream to visit everywhere in the world. That dream was cut tragically short when only one country remained: Galkhein.\nIn each of her consecutive lives, Rishe\u2019s priority became staying alive. Every time, without fail, just as she found her footing, the world was plunged into chaos. She never had the chance to see Galkhein. This betrothal was her chance. \u201cIt\u2019s probably why I agreed to marry you,\u201d she added after a moment\u2019s hesitation.\nArnold swept a tepid glance over the city. \u201cThere\u2019s nothing here worth seeing.\u201d\n\u201cThat\u2019s not true! The places you just told me about sound amazing! Your citizens are clean and happy, your knights are proper and kind. Oh, and another\u2014\u201d \nRishe broke off enumerating Galkhein\u2019s charms as Arnold turned to look at her. His face was impassively calm, but something seemed to pass by underneath, like a shadow in deep water.\n\u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d Rishe said. \u201cDid I say something odd?\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m just amazed you could be so unaware of yourself.\u201d \nWh-what a rude thing to\u2014\n\u201cI\u2019ve never met anyone like you. No one has ever spoken to me the way you do. I don\u2019t know any girls of your class with the knowledge or the physical abilities you possess. Noblewomen don\u2019t concern themselves with such things.\u201d\nRishe, there is no need for you to think for yourself.\nShe frowned. \u201cPerhaps you\u2019re right, but everything I\u2019ve learned is precious to me. No one can take my skills away\u2014I value them with my life. Some may say that my knowledge is worthless, but it makes no difference to me.\u201d She turned from the balcony, fixing him with a piercing gaze. \u201cI\u2019m the one who decides what I value.\u201d\nRishe had clawed free of her mother and father\u2019s indoctrination a long time ago. Man, woman\u2014it didn\u2019t matter. She could do anything. Being queen was not the culmination of her life; she wouldn\u2019t trade her freedom for anything.\nArnold matched her intensity. \u201cYou\u2019re right.\u201d He gently cupped her cheek in a one hand, swiping his thumb along the line of her jaw, smearing dust. \u201cLive your life here however you wish. I vow to do my utmost to protect you.\u201d\n\u201cHuh?\u201d\nHis vehemence took her by surprise. Arnold had every right to demand she act the part of a proper consort. This was a political marriage; Rishe was essentially a hostage, after all. Yet here he was, cosigning her misbehavior. Moreover, he was all but swearing to defend her from the consequences.\n\u201cWhy?\u201d\n\u201cYou know why. I\u2019m enamored with you.\u201d Arnold fed her the same line. \u201cI know you said you don\u2019t care about other people\u2019s approval, but I like your asymmetrical talents. I don\u2019t find them useless at all.\u201d \nRishe didn\u2019t know how to respond.\n\u201cI thought I\u2019d already made that clear.\u201d He took his hand back, drawing away, stopping just on the threshold. He turned back to a stunned Rishe and said, \u201cLet me know if there\u2019s anything you desire. I realize I just broke our agreement\u2014the one about not touching you.\u201d\nAnd with that, he was gone.\nShaken, Rishe sank to the floor of the balcony. I can\u2019t predict him at all! Just what is Arnold Hein planning?\nThe quiet of evening fell over the imperial capital of Galkhein.\n \n***\n \n\u201cMmm.\u201d\nSunshine streamed through the window as Rishe roused from sleep. She rolled over, basking in the morning light. The wall she expected wasn\u2019t there, and the bed seemed larger than usual. Taking advantage of it, she stretched out as far as she could.\nWas this her chamber at home? Or maybe she was a merchant again, spending a night at the desert king\u2019s palace. Perhaps this was her bed of straw from her life as a maid? Her memories met and interwove as she drifted into wakefulness.\nWhen Rishe finally opened her eyes, she grew even more confused.\nLight blue curtains surrounded the bed, thin enough to allow sunlight to pass through. She pulled them aside to find herself in a bare room devoid of furniture and carpet.\nOh, right. She didn\u2019t need to report for morning training, tend to her herb garden, prepare breakfast, or see how the bottles she had brewed overnight were coming along.\nRealizing that, Rishe buried her face in the pillow. \u201cSo soft,\u201d she murmured. \nJudging by the position of the sun, it was about six o\u2019clock in the morning. She was pretty sure she had gone to bed around midnight last night.\nI slept for six whole hours? Rishe couldn\u2019t believe it. Generally, she was used to getting about four hours of sleep. On bad days, at the height of an emergency as a knight or apothecary, she wouldn\u2019t even get that much. \nI\u2019ve got nothing but cleaning on the schedule today. Hostages can sleep in, right? At least a little? Excitement suffused her at the thought, but that was interrupted by a knock on the door.\n\u201cLady Rishe, are you awake? It\u2019s Oliver\u2014Prince Arnold\u2019s attendant.\u201d\nRishe sat up with a start. \u201cI\u2019m awake!\u201d\nOliver continued to speak through the door. \u201cI apologize for bothering you at such an early hour. I\u2019m here with a delivery.\u201d\n\u201cJust a moment!\u201d Rishe slipped out of the bed, dressed quickly, and tugged the bed\u2019s canopy closed. She opened the door to find Oliver standing in the hallway with a polite smile.\nHe apologized again. \u201cThis was the only time I could slip away from His Highness\u2019s office. I\u2019m glad to see that you\u2019re already dressed.\u201d\n\u201cNot at all.\u201d Rishe paused, stepping back to allow him inside. \u201cOh my. You look exhausted.\u201d\nOliver grimaced. \u201cIs it that obvious? We\u2019ve been climbing through mountains of paperwork, but never mind me. His Highness has been working around the clock.\u201d\nRishe thought back to yesterday, how he had come all the way out to the balcony. He should have used that spare time to sleep. \u201cHe\u2019s in high demand, isn\u2019t he? He was even working on the trip over.\u201d\n\u201cHe finished all the work he brought along with us,\u201d Oliver confirmed. \u201cNow he\u2019s dealing with everything that piled up during his visit to Hermity.\u201d\n\u201cOh.\u201d Rishe grimaced in sympathy. He may have killed her in a past life, but she wouldn\u2019t wish the bureaucracy of kingship on anyone. \u201cIt\u2019s a shame he had to put his work on hold to attend a silly engagement party.\u201d\n\u201cNo matter. That party was how a committed bachelor finally found a bride.\u201d\nHis smile was sincere, but Rishe knew better. She spread her arms. \u201c",
    "query_text": "Go on. Shall I spin around so you have a better view?\u201d\nOliver blinked. \u201cI beg your pardon?\u201d\n\u201cYou\u2019re looking me over like I\u2019m a horse for sale. If there\u2019s anything I can help you with, please let me know.\u201d\nOliver\u2019s brows went up. He let out a little breath of resignation. \u201cHis Highness was right. You do possess the keen perception of a knight. Of course, I\u2019m purely an amateur myself.\u201d\nI\u2019d say this was a merchant\u2019s sixth sense, rather than battle intuition.\nThis wasn\u2019t the first time Rishe had caught Oliver looking at her. It reminded her of the way her noble customers would examine a product, assessing worth and authenticity. Or a merchant weeding out potential merchandise from a wide array of choices.\nIn other words, he was appraising her.\n"

And if it wouldn\u2019t be an intrusion\u2014I would like to train with you.\u201d If she studied him, she could learn his strategies and his attack patterns. She\u2019d never be a match in speed or raw power, but any insight would be invaluable.\n\u201cSure.\u201d Arnold shrugged. \u201cI don\u2019t mind.\u201d\n\u201cTruly?\u201d Her eyes glittered with anticipation.\nHe chuckled. \u201cYour answers never disappoint me.\u201d\n\u201cWhat\u2019s that supposed to mean? Oh, it looks like they\u2019re playing a new song.\u201d\nA soft melody drifted across the hall. The crowd divided, heading toward the center of the floor or against the wall. The next dance was starting, and everyone was waiting to see what the crown prince and his new fianc\u00e9e would do.\n\u201cWe don\u2019t have to dance if you don\u2019t want to,\u201d Arnold said.\n\u201cOh? As it happens, I like dancing.\u201d Plus, she couldn\u2019t resist a blatant challenge. She offered him her hand.\n\u201cVery well, then.\u201d Arnold only hesitated for a moment before taking it and steering her gently to an empty spot on the floor. He didn\u2019t seem like the dancing type, but his movements were slick and effortless. Facing one another, they joined hands. Arnold wrapped his other arm around her waist. \nOoh. His hand felt huge against her back. She realized she was breathing a little faster. They\u2019d never been this close before.\nNo, that isn\u2019t quite true. This is the second time. Rishe\u2019s final memories from her last life flashed vividly through her mind.\nThis was indeed the second time they had been this close\u2014the first had ended with a sword through her chest.\nEmperor Arnold Hein had single-handedly decimated the knights in the castle. Rishe stood in the midst of the carnage, breath ragged as she gripped the hilt of her sword, slick with her own blood. She was the last line of defense. The chamber behind her housed the royal family.\nIf they could reach the hidden passageways, the young prince and his party could find shelter with their allies across the border. Rishe and the other knights were prepared to sacrifice their lives to allow the royal family to survive. Their escape meant victory.\nBells tolled out, urging flight. All is lost. Run. Rishe managed to graze Arnold\u2019s cheek with her blade before she looked down to find his jet-black sword blooming out of her chest.\nShe remembered how it burned, as if the blade was made of fire. It was heat, not pain, but her breathing grew labored, and when Emperor Arnold Hein withdrew his sword, Rishe crumpled. \nHe knelt by her side and whispered something.\nThe words were seared into her memory. Rishe squeezed Arnold\u2019s hand as they danced.\nI\u2019ll be the bully this time. \nRishe shifted her weight back, slipping out of the hold on her waist. She broke Arnold\u2019s lead and spun, drifting on the harmony of the dance. She took him by surprise; his eyes went wide.\nI wonder what you\u2019ll do when you\u2019re no longer on top, Your Highness. Her smile was a declaration of war. Watching him attempt to follow her lead would be delightful. She pulled his hand toward her, attempting to move them into a spin.\nBut Arnold held fast. He planted his hand on her waist and turned them in a different direction, using her inertia against her. Hey! As a result, Rishe twirled by herself on the spot.\nShe didn\u2019t miss a step. She turned elegantly, the hem of her dress whispering across the ballroom floor. She heard appreciative murmurs from the wallflowers lined up watching.\nDespite that, Rishe took it as a defeat. Round one to Arnold. \nSo\u2026you can think on your feet. How about this?\nArnold remained unruffled, evading her next scheme like it was nothing. He grinned down at her, his eyes shining with a dare.\nHe thinks I can\u2019t beat him. His ease vexed her, but it was his smugness that made her angry.\nShe let out a hard breath, attempting a maneuver to lure him in while turning. He leaned back, not falling for it at all.\nHe\u2019s just too good at changing his center of gravity! She kept her astonishment under wraps, but she felt it. Despite how close we\u2019re dancing, I can\u2019t throw off his timing at all. He\u2019s sidestepped all my attempts, and he takes back the lead the second I let down my guard!\nIt made her increasingly angry. She twirled and stepped as the dance dictated, all the while feeling out for moments of weakness. Arnold played along with her game, completely unruffled.\nEvery single time. I\u2019m doing my utmost to trip him up, but he doesn\u2019t even seem annoyed! At this point she\u2019d just settle for any reaction at all.\nTheir unusual dance style had gathered a crowd. Rishe paid them no mind, focused only on her goal. Then something occurred to her, and her breath caught in her throat.\nWait a minute, he has left an opening. It\u2019s the same one from before. She thought back to their fight to the death, to that moment when she had managed to draw blood. That may indeed have been his only weakness.\nIf I strike the same way\u2014huh? Before she could try, Arnold appeared to lose patience, wrapping his arm around her waist. He bent her back into a dip so deep it felt like he\u2019d pulled a carpet from under her feet. She yelped, grabbing at him reflexively, clinging tight. His big hands gripped her securely enough to mitigate the sensation of falling. Relief flooded through her, and she felt a laugh rumble against her ear.\nThe music came to an end with one last ringing note. She blinked. The dance is over?\nA hush fell over the ballroom. Then cheers broke out, followed by a round of applause.\n\u201cThat was incredible!\u201d\nThe watching nobles crowded in.\n\u201cYou two moved in such perfect harmony!\u201d\n\u201cI was on the edge of my seat. I felt like I was watching a sword duel!\u201d\n\u201cIs this a dance from Hermity? I\u2019ve never seen such steps before.\u201d\n\u201cUh, well\u2026\u201d Rishe floundered. She glanced up at Arnold, who appeared to be enjoying her struggle. She\u2019d get no help from him.\nRishe dealt with the barrage of questions as best she could, letting the crowd sweep them into the dining room, which was set up for a buffet-style meal. She made sure to greet every guest, riveting their faces into her memory.\nShe must have been acting peculiar, because Arnold eventually said, \u201cRishe, I think the wine is getting to you. Shall we get some fresh air?\u201d\nRishe hadn\u2019t touched a single drop. In fact, she\u2019d been caught up in so many conversations that she hadn\u2019t even had the chance to eat, but she had experience working on an empty stomach. She accepted Arnold\u2019s encouragement as the escape it was.\nJust when I least expect it, he\u2019ll act the gentleman. Maybe he\u2019d remembered her demand for a carefree life of doing nothing.\nRishe cast a charming look across the crowd. \u201cThank you for your consideration, Your Highness. Forgive me.\u201d She gave a polite bow before quietly slipping away. \nShe didn\u2019t",
    "query_text": " head straight to the balcony but rather slowly walked around the hall. There was only so much she could find out glued to Arnold\u2019s side all night.\nI need information. Galkhein\u2019s political landscape was a mystery to me through all my past lives. I"

If there\u2019s anything too large and cumbersome, feel free to pass it over to me.\u201d\n\u201cTh-thank you so much!\u201d The new maids went weak with gratitude. One of them, a girl on the verge of tears, even fell into a full bow. Rishe muttered encouragement as she scrubbed some bedsheets.\nElsie, who was washing the sheets with her, wore a rueful look. \u201cI\u2019m so sorry for the trouble. We\u2019re just not learning fast enough.\u201d\n\u201cYou haven\u2019t been working here long, have you? It takes time to learn a new job, no matter who you are,\u201d Rishe said as she kept scrubbing. \u201cAnd it\u2019s not like you\u2019ve never washed a single thing in your life before, right?\u201d\nElsie nodded nervously. \nRishe had realized over the past few days doing the laundry that not all the newcomers were complete amateurs. They\u2019d obviously done chores at home, or something similar. When set a specific task, they could perform it properly, but Diana\u2019s complaints weren\u2019t unfounded. They did take far too much time with laundry.\nBut it\u2019s obvious why. \u201cDo you know anything about Diana?\u201d Rishe asked Elsie. \u201cLike, is she from a well-off family?\u201d\nElsie said, \u201cI heard that her father was a business owner. She worked with him.\u201d\n\u201cI heard that as well,\u201d added another maid. \u201cBut he fell into debt and had to sell off.\u201d \nRishe stopped scrubbing for a moment to consider this.\n\u201cUm, is something the matter?\u201d Elsie asked.\nRishe smiled and shook her head. \u201cNo, nothing. Let\u2019s just focus on getting these washed for the time being.\u201d\n \n***\n \nThat afternoon, thirty maids were assembled in the detached wing of the palace. Ten of them were old hands, long in service to the royal family, while the other twenty were freshly hired. The crown princess was to choose her maids from among these thirty. They wore their nerves plainly on their sleeves. \n\u201cHey, I thought this palace was in a terrible state of neglect,\u201d one maid whispered. \u201cWhy is it so sparkling clean?\u201d\n\u201cYeah, you\u2019re right,\u201d said another. \u201cSomeone must have sorted it out before we arrived.\u201d\n\u201cI wonder what kind of person Lady Rishe is. Ooh, I\u2019m so nervous.\u201d\nThe girls looked around anxiously.\n\u201cHey, Elsie, that girl who was always helping us isn\u2019t here.\u201d\nElsie blinked. \u201cYou\u2019re right.\u201d\n\u201cLook, Diana. That impertinent newbie didn\u2019t get picked.\u201d \nAt her friend\u2019s observation, Diana preened with satisfaction. \u201cNo surprise there. You need some manners to attend to Lady Rishe. I bet she got kicked out of the running!\u201d Her eyes sparkled with confidence.\nAt last, there was a knock at the door.\n\u201cHer Royal Highness, Princess Rishe.\u201d\nThe maids quickly fell into bows. Diana\u2019s chest ached with anticipation as heels clicked on the floor, approaching the line of girls. From the corner of their eyes, the maids saw a wide-skirted court dress. A gentle scent washed over them.\nWithout even looking at her, they could tell Crown Princess Rishe was a lovely woman. Diana and her friends swelled with pride that she was to become their mistress.\nBut then Laura whispered to Diana, \u201cHey, isn\u2019t this scent familiar?\u201d\n\u201cQuiet!\u201d Clearly it was some sort of expensive perfume. Or so Diana thought, but then she realized what it was. The words just slipped out. \u201cIt\u2019s soap.\u201d\n\u201cHuh? Did you just say something?\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s soap. The same kind we always use.\u201d Diana was sure of it.\nThe princess said, \u201cPlease rise.\u201d \nWhy did her voice sound so familiar? An incredible foreboding gripping her, Diana looked up. She gasped.\n\u201cMy name is Rishe Irmgard Weitzner.\u201d\nBefore her stood the beautiful newcomer\u2014the thorn in her side for the past few days. The smile she wore was peaceful and just the slightest bit satisfied.\n \n***\n \nI\u2019m so glad I managed to finish washing the sheets in time!\nStanding before the maids with Arnold\u2019s attendant Oliver at her side, Rishe was panicking on the inside. She\u2019d had so much to do this morning that she\u2019d put off the laundry to the last minute. She took deep, controlled breaths, praying no one would notice that she\u2019d raced here at a dead sprint.\nOliver was none the wiser as he spoke to the assembled girls. Rishe took the opportunity to look them over. She locked eyes with Elsie, who was gaping at her. It was a nice change\u2014usually her face was as blank as a rock wall.\nI\u2019m sorry for the deception. I figured blending in would give me the best picture of your working conditions.\nThe new maids wore similarly shocked expressions, while others watched her with delight. Meanwhile, the veterans, including Diana, had all gone pale. They trembled, stunned into silence. One seemed locked in a terrifying trance, while another looked on the verge of tears. All of them had spoken to Rishe with derision. As the ringleader, Diana was covering her mouth with both hands, like she was holding in a scream.\nOliver had finished his introduction. \u201cYour Highness, if you would?\u201d\nRishe stepped forward. \u201cFirst, I must apologize to you for what has transpired prior to this meeting. My deception, that is. However, it has granted me insight into how each one of you works.\u201d\nOliver\u2019s face creased in confusion. The newcomer maids began to panic, whispering among themselves.\n\u201cDoesn\u2019t this mean that she helped us out with the laundry?\u201d\n\u201cWe\u2019re going to be fired!\u201d\n\u201cIf I lose my position, my brother will have to quit school!\u201d\nNoticing the commotion, Oliver glanced at Rishe. \u201cYour Highness, two-thirds of these maids are newly recruited from the city. Since the majority of the castle maids were elderly, His Highness assumed you would prefer maids closer in age to yourself.\u201d\nRishe was startled. She had found it odd that most of her potential servants were new hires, but she hadn\u2019t expected this to be the reason.\n\u201cWhile the prince has entrusted the selection of your maids to you,\u201d Oliver went on. \u201cHiring someone with no experience will not do. Despite Prince Arnold\u2019s views, I urge you to reject the newcomers.\u201d\n\u201cOliver.\u201d\n\u201cI have a list of their names here. Elsie\u2014\u201d\n\u201cElsie, Nichole, Hilde, Marguerite, Rosa.\u201d Rishe began listing the names of the newly recruited maids. She\u2019d made a point to memorize them in the washhouse. \u201cElke, Amelia, and\u2014\u201d\nOliver looked at her wildly. \u201cYou know them all?! Even though they\u2019ve never served you in the past?\u201d\n\u201cYes, of course I do. Servants are essential to the maintenance of our lifestyle, why wouldn\u2019t I get to know them?\u201d Rishe listed the remaining names for good measure. \u201cAll twenty of you, listen to me.\u201d \nThe new maids stiffened. Diana and the other maids whose names hadn\u2019t been called were getting their wind back, wearing increasingly triumphant looks.\nRishe said, \u201cThe twenty names I just called will be my maids.\u201d\nTime seemed to stand still a moment, and then Oliver broke in with an astonished, \u201cB-but, my lady! They are all inexperienced\u2014\u201d\n\u201cYes. And my palace will be the perfect place to learn.\u201d\nThe new recruits were completely speechless, unsure of exactly what was happening. \nRishe smiled at Elsie. \u201cI hope you\u2019ll serve me well, Elsie.\u201d\nElsie was still frozen in place. \u201cHuh? Y-yes, my lady, but\u2014\u201d\nA shaking Diana cried out, \u201cBut why, my lady?! You\u2019ve seen their work! They\u2019re useless, the lot of them! The rest of us get so much more done in a shorter amount of time!\u201d\n\u201cWatch your tongue, girl,\u201d Oliver said sharply.\nDiana ignored him. \u201cWe\u2019re hard workers! Any job you assign us, we can do it! Please, I beg you, my lady!\u201d\n\u201cStep back,\u201d Oliver warned. \u201cDo not take a single step closer to Lady Rishe.\u201d\nDiana spoke in a rush, words pouring out of her. \u201cI-I freely admit that I was impolite before, but I didn\u2019t know who she was! I\u2019ll take any punishment, so please, give me the chance to show you how well I can work!\u201d\nRishe said, \u201cDiana, I have a request.\u201d\n\u201cTh-thank you, my lady!\u201d Diana heaved a sigh of relief. \u201cYou mean you\u2019ll\u2014\u201d \nRishe cut across her. \u201cAs of today, you are no longer a maid in this palace.\u201d \n\u201cWhat?\u201d Her face, usually so fixed with determination, paled. \u201cBut why? I\u2019m so much better than any of them! I\u2019ll do a perfect job no matter what task you set before me. Please don\u2019t dismiss me, my lady!\u201d \n\u201cListen to me, Diana.\u201d Rishe dropped her lofty tone, speaking as one woman would to another. \u201cYou have noticed it, haven\u2019t you? No matter what you claim, these new girls aren\u2019t worthless.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2026I don\u2019t understand.\u201d\n\u201cCan you remember your first month in service? How difficult it was?\u201d\nDiana looked completely bewildered. Her gaze darted around as if looking for help.\nPulling herself together, she forced herself to follow Rishe\u2019s directions. She thought back and finally alighted on a response. \u201cI\u2026I didn\u2019t know how to do the job. Before, when my family was still prominent, I\u2019d washed shirts and bedsheets. Never gowns or military uniforms.\u201d\n\u201cPerfectly reasonable,\u201d Rishe said. \u201cOnly natural for someone just starting out.\u201d\n\u201cThe older girls were so busy, they told me to just watch them since they didn\u2019t have time to teach me. When I had questions\u2026well, there was nobody to ask.\u201d\n\u201cI bet. And did you have any other problems?\u201d\n\u201cWell, yes. There was a lot to learn. Different kinds of soap and washboards depending on the cloth. You use different tools for different materials. I had to learn how they worked and how to put them away. I was\u2026punished if I didn\u2019t get it right the first time.\u201d\nThe newcomers were exchanging surprised looks. Rishe understood why.\nEverything Diana said was familiar to them. They spent valuable time searching for their materials and the proper ways to use them, but they shrank from asking for help. Everyone always looked so busy. This was a universal problem.\n\u201cDespite all that, I got better!\u201d Diana protested. \u201cI only needed to be taught once. Unlike them! They\u2019re useless!\u201d\n\u201cYes, well. There\u2019s a difference between you and them,\u201d Rishe told Diana. \u201cYou can read and write.\u201d\n\u201cOh!\u201d Diana started in surprise. Elsie looked at the floor.\nThe literacy rate among commoners was low no matter where you went. Very few families had the means to afford an education, especially for daughters. Diana had been born to a merchant\u2019s family\u2014she\u2019d received formal schooling. The maids she was close friends with were likely from similar backgrounds. The majority of those in service were not so fortunate.\n\u201cWhat if you only received instructions on how to do a job once and weren\u2019t able to write it down to remind yourself later?\u201d Rishe asked. \u201cWould you be so confident?\u201d\n\u201cI-I don\u2019t\u2014\u201d Diana reflexively thrust a hand into her apron pocket, where she had a list of daily tasks recorded in her neat handwriting to reference throughout the day. Hopefully now she would understand how much of an edge her privileged literacy gave her over the other maids.\n\u201cEveryone else works as hard as they can, just like you do,\u201d Rishe said. \u201cRemember how it was for you at first? They all have to start somewhere. I hope you\u2019ll keep that in mind.\u201d\n\u201cThey\u2019re no different from me,\u201d Diana mumbled begrudgingly, glancing around the room, looking at the less experienced maids. As if coming to a decision, she said, \u201cI\u2019m sorry.\u201d\n\u201cDiana?\u201d\nLike a child enumerating her regrets, Diana went on, \u201cI\u2019ve done you wrong, all of you. It\u2019s just, I had nothing. Or so it felt like. No money, no title. I thought I had to make my way in the world on my own. That I had to start from zero.\u201d Her shoulders trembled as she buried her face in her hands. \u201cBut I was wrong! I wasn\u2019t starting from zero. I had everything that I learned growing up. I didn\u2019t realize how fortunate I was. I let it all go to my he\n \n\u201cRISHE IRMGARD WEITZNER! You are a vile woman! A truly malicious creature unworthy of the crown prince! As of this instant, our engagement is off!\u201d \n\u201cAs you wish, Your Highness.\u201d\n\u201c\u2026Huh?\u201d\nThe prince\u2019s declaration echoed throughout the ballroom. Rishe, the duke\u2019s daughter, bowed in response, her coral-toned hair swaying gracefully. The assembled guests found themselves captivated by her dignified beauty. Despite having just witnessed a broken engagement, they couldn\u2019t bring themselves to pity her.\nSlowly, Rishe lifted her head and fixed the prince with a pale-emerald gaze. It caught him off guard, but he quickly recovered.\n\u201cDidn\u2019t you hear what I just said?! I\u2019m calling off our engagement! Doesn\u2019t that trouble you?\u201d\n\u201cNot really.\u201d\nRishe already knew what happened next: false accusations, exile, and her family severing all ties and leaving her to survive on her own. She turned from the prince. There was no point wasting any time.\nThis is my seventh loop, after all.\nRishe had done this all before.\nThe next few hours will be busy. I must hurry and retrieve my things before I\u2019m barred from the family estate. I don\u2019t want this to be one of the times I\u2019m too slow and I have to start my new life with nothing.\n\u201cRishe, halt and hear me! I have spent the past week perfecting my recitation of your crimes!\u201d\nI should take more than dresses this time\u2014there\u2019s plenty of things I could use out in the world. What trade should I take up? In my first life, I was a merchant. In my second, an apothecary. I\u2019ve got a few more I want to try out\u2026 Augh! If time\u2019s just going to keep resetting, I wish I could start at an earlier point. I need more time to prepare!\n\u201cWait! Rishe!\u201d\nThe crown prince was on the verge of tears, and the spectators struggled to suppress their snickers. \nA thought occurred to Rishe, and she stopped. She then turned, her eyes gleaming beneath long lashes as she stared down her ex-fianc\u00e9. \u201cAh, Your Highness, I almost forgot.\u201d \n\u201cYes, tell me!\u201d the prince fumed. \u201cLet me guess, you are hurt beyond measure and yet love me still\u2026correct?\u201d\nAs if. Rishe was grateful to be granted her freedom. In fact, she was smiling as she said, \u201cI hope you and Lady Mary are happy together.\u201d\n\u201cWhat?!\u201d\n\u201cMay we both lead fulfilling lives. Farewell!\u201d Rishe lifted the skirts of her evening gown and turned on her heel, departing as briskly as she could.\n\u201cHow do you know about Mary? I haven\u2019t told you I love her!\u201d The prince was shouting something behind her, but she paid him no mind. She had things to do.\nDuring her first loop, the prince\u2019s accusations had shocked her to the core and she\u2014foolishly so",
    "query_text": "\u2014had attempted to defend herself. Now she knew better than to expect the prince to behave reasonably. \nHow will life unfold this time? I\u2019m excited to find out! Rishe fixed her mind on the future.\nThis is my seventh \u201cdo-over.\u201d I\u2019ve led happy and carefree lives before, but this time\u2014this time, I swear I\u2019ll live a long happy and carefree life!\nIn other words, she needed to avoid getting killed. At any cost. \n \n***\n \nIn the first loop, with her engagement broken and her reputation in tatters, Rishe roamed with nothing but the clothes on jewelry"

    "prefix_text": " like any noblewoman, but your manner is\u2026\u201d \n\u201cEmperor Arnold Hein!\u201d \nThe man\u2019s eyes widened. He didn\u2019t mistake her surging contempt. Rishe had crossed swords with this man. Recently. He was the one responsible for ending her sixth life. \nHe must be a guest at the banquet. It makes sense.\nArnold Hein was the scion of a military nation not far from Rishe\u2019s home country of Hermity, the one in which they now stood. Their kingdoms, so recently at war, had brokered an ostensible peace, and the two ruling families met from time to time. Crown Prince Dietrich\u2019s engagement party would be one such occasion. He\u2019d gathered elites from far and wide to introduce to his beloved Mary.\nThe man eyed Rishe with rising curiosity. \u201cYou know me? This is my first time in Hermity.\u201d\nUh-oh. Rishe pasted on a smile as her mind spun in circles. This man was dangerous. She had to avoid entanglements with him at all costs. Five years from now, Arnold Hein would invade Hermity. \nHe was an extraordinarily skilled swordsman and, with a powerful military at his back, was destined to conquer kingdom after kingdom. He had done as much in her second, third, fourth, and fifth lives. In her sixth, Rishe had faced him in battle herself and died by his hand.\nWe never had a chance. That war was lost before it began.\nArnold\u2019s brilliance lay not in his swordplay but in his skill as a tactician. He set countries up for conquest and knocked them down, swallowing them one by one.\nI know him, but he doesn\u2019t know me. We haven\u2019t met in this life. I need an excuse fast. \nRishe curtsied slowly. \u201cMy name is Rishe Irmgard Weitzner. We\u2019ve never been introduced, but I\u2019ve heard of you.\u201d\nArnold donned an amused smile. \u201cYou plant your weight like a trained swordswoman. Your center of gravity is perfect.\u201d\n\u201cYou exaggerate,\u201d Rishe demurred. \u201cThat was simply a curtsy to an esteemed guest.\u201d \n\u201cI must have misheard, but I swear you called me \u2018emperor\u2019 just now.\u201d \nRishe froze.\n\u201cMy father yet lives,\u201d Arnold said. \u201cI am simply a crown prince. Why would you call me that?\u201d \n\u201cUh, um\u2026\u201d Rishe floundered for an answer.\nShe\u2019d made such a foolish mistake. Arnold\u2019s gaze cut right through her. It felt like he\u2019d see through any lie she told right down to her soul. She remembered this from the battlefield\u2014how his attention alone felt like a sword thrust.\nBut why even bother to lie? They\u2019d never meet again, so who cared what he thought of her? Sure, she harbored a hard feeling or two over the recent slaying, but there was no point complaining about it to this Arnold. Calling him the emperor was boorish, but Rishe was in the process of being forcibly exiled. Why play at diplomacy?\nShe took a deep breath and bowed low. This was not the curtsy of a noble lady but of a servant bowing in supplication to her master.\n\u201cMy humblest apologies, Your Highness. I was in a rush. Such a rude slip of the tongue.\u201d She raised her head. \u201cMy ex-fianc\u00e9 just annulled our engagement, so I\u2019ve got a lot on my mind. If you would excuse me.\u201d \n\u201cHe annulled your engagement?\u201d\nAt that, Rishe turned and fled.\nThis unexpected run-in with Arnold had taken up valuable time. She threw open the door to the balcony and hiked up her skirts, kicking off her shoes in anticipation of jumping into a tree. Looking down, she realized the ground was far closer than she\u2019d feared.\nExcellent! I can just drop into the garden!\nArnold, who up until now had been rendered speechless, shook himself out of his fugue as Rishe clambered over the railing. \u201cHey!\u201d\nRishe\u2019s moonlight-silver dress flowed around her as she leapt. The lawn was soft, but the fall was still far enough to risk injury.\nWeight evenly distributed on the soles of my feet, roll to transfer the impact to my shins and thighs, then onto my hips and my back.\nShe landed safely, rolled nimbly in her dress, and popped back up. Her hair was covered in leaves. \nI need to hurry up!\nBracing against a nearby rock, she used her weight to snap the heels off of her shoes. There. That would make running a little easier. Satisfied, she slipped them back on and made haste toward the family estate. \n \n***\n \nUp on the balcony, Crown Prince Arnold of Galkhein watched the spectacle play out from beginning to end. He gazed at the girl with the coral hair. Her appearance was that of any young noblewoman, but she moved like a well-trained knight. She\u2019d leapt from the balcony and landed skillfully, showing no signs of distress at her ripped dress or disheveled hair. Instead, she\u2019d knocked the heels off her shoes and dashed away.\nAlso, she had called him an emperor.\nPlaying it all over again in his head, Arnold broke out into a rare chuckle. As his shoulders quivered with laughter, his attendant approached him from behind.\n\u201cThere you are, Your Highness. What are you doing out here? I\u2019m aware you don\u2019t desire a wife, but beginning the search would be wise\u2026 Er, Your Highness?\u201d The attendant\u2019s eyes flew wide. His bored and scowling master was laughing. \u201cDid something happen?\u201d\n\u201cOliver, ready my coach. Wait, no. That will take too much time. Bring me a horse.\u201d\n\u201cAt once, Your Highness. Might I ask why?\u201d\nArnold didn\u2019t respond\u2014he just grinned like a hungry wolf catching scent of his prey.\n \n***\n \nOnce outside the palace gates, Rishe threw herself into the waiting coach, shouting for the driver to make haste. She stopped it a few hundred yards from the manor and bid him farewell. \u201cI\u2019m leaving! Thanks for always being such a safe driver, Daniel!\u201d\nThe road to the manor was muddy from a morning rain shower. She knew from her second life that the coach would get stuck, resulting in a loss of valuable time. It was better to just get out and run. \n\u201cHuff, huff.\u201d Despite her last life\u2019s physical conditioning, this body had no stamina. She\u2019d need to try to get fitter faster this time around.\nRishe reached the end of the road",
    "query_text": ", and her heart promptly sank all the way to her feet. \u201cOh no.\u201d\nThe front door was thronged with people, all of them surrounding a carriage bearing the royal family\u2019s coat of arms.\nI need to get out of here.\nWhile she stood frozen in indecision, one of the knights doing crowd control shouted, \u201cYour Highness! I have eyes on Lady Rishe!\u201d\n\u201cGet out of my way!\u201d A familiar voice started up a bellow. \u201cLet me through! Rishe, how dare you make me wait so long?\u201d\nRishe\u2019s ex-fianc\u00e9, Crown Prince Dietrich, stepped triumphantly forward.\n\u201cI know the thought of hearing your crimes enumerated by the man you love must pain you, but alas, as future king, it is my duty to bring down"

    "prefix_text": " wanted to marry Rishe. Her murderer wanted to marry her.\nWhy is he doing this? He must have some ulterior motive, a broader goal. But I have to give him an answer.\nThe onlookers were holding their breath as Rishe said flatly, \u201cI reject your proposal.\u201d\nArnold said nothing.\nShe had to reject him. She was going to live a long, peaceful, carefree life, damn it, and no one would stop her. And yet\u2026\nArnold began to laugh, and the deep, creeping sense of dread inside Rishe only grew. Why does he seem so amused by this?!\n \n***\n \nHer previous life was her sixth. Disguised as a man, Rishe rose as a warrior of an island country she came upon in her travels. It was a conventional yet charming kingdom formed of red brick. After striking up a friendship with a group of knights who didn\u2019t realize she was a woman, Rishe followed their advice and joined them.\nThe training was grueling enough to make her wish she were dead. Back when she had lived as a noble, she\u2019d learned how to wield a sword for basic self-defense, but training as a noble lady had in no way prepared her for this. She drilled relentlessly, barely taking the time to sleep. Just as she became a full-fledged knight, Emperor Arnold\u2019s forces lay siege to the castle.\n \n***\n \nHow could this happen? \nIn her seventh life, Rishe wearily sank into her chair. Across from her sat Arnold, his legs crossed and chin propped up on his hand, watching her lazily.\n\u201cWhat\u2019s the matter?\u201d he asked. \u201cYou seem unhappy.\u201d\n\u201cYou could say that.\u201d Even her voice was grumpy. Still, she couldn\u2019t very well tell him it was because she bore a grudge from a previous life. After the first time her life rewound to that pivotal moment, she\u2019d resolved to keep her loops a secret. \u201cI had plans for my exile. A brand-new life. And now because of you, my parents are involved. Even the king has heard about it!\u201d\nAfter Rishe rejected Arnold, Dietrich had immediately cried out, \u201cTh-the crown prince of Galkhein proposed to Rishe?!\u201d\nHis shrieks were loud enough to attract the attention of the master and mistress of the manor.\nWhen her parents came out, Rishe had protested, \u201cI\u2019m not going to marry him! I\u2019m leaving the country just as Dietrich commanded.\u201d\nNo one listened. Their faces just paled with nervous confusion.\nJust then, a glittering coach arrived. Half-stuck in the mud, the man inside it was forced to trudge over the swampy ground, and so the king of Hermity himself arrived, staggering and dirt-stained. \nHe grabbed hold of his son\u2019s collar, pushing him into a low bow. He then turned to Prince Arnold and said, rather loudly, \u201cYour Highness! Allow me to apologize for my son\u2019s foolishness! You are an esteemed guest all the way from Galkhein! It is unthinkable he would not offer you the courtesy you are due!\u201d\n\u201cYou\u2019re hurting me, Father! My back!\u201d\nThe king then turned to Rishe. \u201cMy lady, allow me to sincerely apologize as both a king and a father. My son\u2019s behavior toward you has been utterly disgraceful. I beg you to please give Prince Arnold\u2019s proposal due consideration. Not only for your own sake but for the sake of your country.\u201d\nThe king bowed to her as deeply as his son had to Arnold, and her parents joined him. Rishe felt dizzy at the sight of this abject debasement in the presence of citizens.\nArnold, who had been watching the proceedings with a detached amusement, sobered and stepped toward the king. \u201cYour Majesty, please rise.\u201d\nWithout the smirk, Arnold\u2019s face immediately reverted to its cold mask. The king didn\u2019t move. Maybe something in Arnold\u2019s voice kept him frozen.\n\u201cSuch a trifle won\u2019t cause discord between our kingdoms,\u201d he went on. \u201cHowever, I would beg a little time to speak with Lady Rishe.\u201d\nLater, Rishe would learn that Arnold\u2019s attendant had spoken to the king\u2019s own gentleman, certain that his words would reach their target. \u201cMy master took such trouble to attend these festivities, and this is the welcome he is offered? I wonder, what will the emperor think when he learns of his son\u2019s slighting at your nation\u2019s hands?\u201d\n\u201cIf you would, Lady Rishe?\u201d The plump king looked to be on the verge of tears.\nRishe had no obligation to accept and no desire to spend a moment longer in this country than was absolutely necessary. But acquiescence seemed the fastest way to move things along.\nAs her mind whirled, Arnold leaned in to whisper, \u201cIf you refuse to hear my suit, you won\u2019t deter me. I\u2019ll simply move on to Plan B.\u201d\nAnd that was how she found herself in one of the palace\u2019s parlors, here to \u201cjust talk\u201d to Prince Arnold. The ball guests were all gone. It was just the two of them.\n\u201cI want to know what you\u2019re planning,\u201d Rishe said flatly.\n\u201cPlanning? Me?\u201d\n\u201cBy asking me to marry you. You don\u2019t know me. A proposal like this wouldn\u2019t come out of the blue.\u201d\nThis man was destined to become an aggressive warmonger over the next few years. He wouldn\u2019t do anything without a dozen motives.\nPrince Arnold just smiled. \u201cI have no plans. I\u2019m simply enamored with you.\u201d\n\u201cEnamored\u2026?\u201d\nThat was the last thing she\u2019d expected him to say. Asking him to elaborate didn\u2019t seem worth the breath\u2014he was obviously lying. As if this ruthless, inhuman creature with ice in his veins could feel even a flicker of affection.\n\u201cWhy refuse me?\u201d Arnold asked. \u201cYour engagement is broken, you\u2019re on the verge of exile, and you have no faction or supporters. At this rate, you\u2019ll be dead within a fortnight. I\u2019d call my offer a stroke of unbelievable fortune.\u201d\n\u201cYou\u2019re not wrong,\u201d Rishe admitted. \u201cOnce upon a time, I would have jumped at your offer.\u201d\nIf it had been made in her first life, for instance. But now Rishe knew better. Her life was only just getting started, and the future held endless possibilities. After the horror of her sixth loop, she yearned for freedom.\nI don\u2019t want to marry him. I won\u2019t be anyone\u2019s captive. Still\u2026\nRishe, more than anyone, knew that the slightest adjustment could enact profound changes on the trajectory of a life. No doubt she\u2019d have many more lives, but this could be the only one where marriage to Arnold would be an option.\nThe dread emperor. The tyrant. The man who will stoke the fires of war. \nRishe knew the gossip, the endless conjecture behind Arnold Hein\u2019s bloody reign, but she didn\u2019t know the truth.\nWhy? The question had haunted her since her first life. She\u2019d never before had the chance to even speak to him.\nShe had wondered it as a merchant, hearing of the distant outbreak of war. She\u2019d wondered when the news of the dead and dying reached her apothecary. When she had comforted her terrified mistress in her life as a maid, assuring her everything would be all right. When she squared off against him in battle, as he plunged a sword through her heart\u2014even then she wondered. \nIf I stick around, maybe I\u2019ll finally have my answer. Half of her was dying to know. The other half didn\u2019t give a damn. And yet\u2026\nShe recalled a childhood dream. Rather, a longing.\nRishe let out a breath. \u201cYou claim you are enamored with me.\u201d\n\u201cYes. I am completely under your spell.\u201d\nTo think he could spout such nonsense with a straight face!\n\u201cThen will you grant me anything I desire?\u201d\n\u201cSo long as it is within my power,\u201d Arnold said. \u201cAnything you want will be yours.\u201d\nRishe hesitated, gathering her thoughts. \u201cI have some conditions.\u201d Arnold silently motioned for her to go on. \u201cI want full control over the wedding festivities. Everything must be procured through merchants of my choosing.\u201d\n\u201cFine.\u201d Arnold nodded. \u201cYou\u2019re free to do business with whomever you wish.\u201d\n\u201cAfter we are married, I must be in a position to mingle with guests from abroad.\u201d\n\u201cThat sounds within the purview of the crown princess. Anything else?\u201d\n\u201cI will be allowed to live in a separate residence from your mother and father.\u201d\nShe meant this seriously, but it made Arnold laugh. \u201cYou don\u2019t seem the type to worry about an overbearing mother-in-law.\u201d\n\u201cYou would be surprised. Combative relationships with one\u2019s new family are the most difficult part of marriage, or so they say. It could be a ramshackle cottage for all I care\u2014I just require a secondary residence.\u201d\nActually, Rishe didn\u2019t care at all about in-laws. When Arnold set his war into motion, his first move would be the assassination of his father. A genuine coup by patricide, not at all like Dietrich\u2019s clumsy attempt. Next, he would name himself emperor, take control of the country, and mobilize the military.\nSeparating him from his parents will make the first step more difficult\u2014although not impossible, unfortunately.\n\u201cAnything else?\u201d Arnold asked. \u201cI\u2019ll do whatever it takes to marry you.\u201d\n\u201cIdeally, I\u2019d like to know your endgame,\u201d Rishe said with dignity. \u201cBut as I doubt there\u2019s any chance of that, I have one final request.\u201d She jabbed a finger into his face, regardless of how rude it was. \u201cI will spend my time idling around the castle. No work, no study. I shall be utterly useless.\u201d\nLet\u2019s see just how much you want me as your princess.\nAfter a long moment of silence, Arnold cracked a merry laugh. The proposal remained; all her conditions were met.\n\n(2) chapter number given is likely out of range: 0\nChapter: 7\n\nChapter 2\nChapter 2\n \n\u201cYOU KNOW, it was only after I went into commerce that I truly had a dream for the future,\u201d Rishe had once confided in a friend. \u201cUp until then, I existed only as the crown prince\u2019s fianc\u00e9e or my father\u2019s daughter. My every act was to become more worthy of that status. But now, for the first time, I actually have a goal of my own.\u201d\n\u201cOh, yeah?\u201d her friend said. He was the ruler of the desert kingdom, and his smile was awfully charming. \u201cWhat\u2019s that?\u201d\nRishe smiled back. \u201cI want to travel to every single country in the world. I want to see everything in every town, peruse their markets, and meet the eyes of every person who lives there!\u201d\nBy now, that felt like such a distant dream.\n \n***\n \nRishe awoke with a start, eyes snapping open as she sensed a disturbance in the air.\nShe unsheathed her sword halfway, primed for danger. \nInside the coach, her old enemy sat across from her, one hand outstretched. \u201cWhat do you think you\u2019re doing?\u201d she demanded.\nWhen they\u2019d boarded the coach, Rishe had warned him not to lay a single finger on her throughout the trip to his kingdom. Ordering the prince not to touch his consort was absurd, but Arnold readily agreed. He had, after all, promised to follow her every direction.\nAnd yet, here he was, already breaking his promise.\nArnold appeared unperturbed by her glare. \u201cDon\u2019t look at me like that. I was merely trying to recover what you took from me.\u201d\nConfused, Rishe looked at the sword in her hand. It had a black lacquered scabbard with a simple golden decoration. Engraved on the hilt was the Galkhein crest.\n\u201cOh!\u201d Rishe thrust the sword back at Arnold. \u201cMy apologies.\u201d\nArnold chuckled. \u201cYou caught me off guard. You were nodding off, and then you suddenly snatched up my sword. You looked quite content snuggling up with it.\u201d\nArnold propped the sword beside him. Rishe pressed a hand to her chest to quell her racing heart. The sword that gutted me in my previous life is now my bedmate. What a world. Her recent stint as a knight had left her ill at ease without a blade at hand. She just couldn\u2019t believe it was Arnold\u2019s she\u2019d reached for.\n\u201cI didn\u2019t mean to disturb you, but I doubted sleeping with a weapon would be comfortable. I\u2019m impressed you sensed my intent before I even touched you.\u201d Arnold rested one elbow against the window frame, watching her with shameless fascination. \u201cOne only develops instincts like that from combat training. And you were also a member of the court? How in the world did you find the time?\u201d\nRishe shrugged. She couldn\u2019t just say, I pretended to be a man in a previous life, that\u2019s how.\n\u201cI assume there\u2019s more to you than your devotion to the sword. You seem to like flowers.\u201d\nShe followed Arnold\u2019s gaze to where she\u2019d bundled a small bouquet in a handkerchief. This was their fifth day on the road to Galkhein. Every day, without fail, she\u2019d picked flowers whenever they stopped to water the horses. The ones from today were still fresh, but the ones she\u2019d begun drying five days ago were just about ready.\n\u201cI didn\u2019t pick these because they\u2019re pretty.\u201d Rishe brought the blooms to her face, spirits rising at their sweet scent. Spring wildflowers had a soft and gentle smell. Rishe looked out the window at the forest spreading toward Galkhein, thinking of the rare native flowers going into bloom. She wished she could pick those as well, but that would cause too much delay. She gazed on wistfully.\nAfter watching her in silence for some time, Arnold said, \u201cBy the way, I sent one of my men ahead on a fast horse to deliver your order to the company you requested. They\u2019ll be invited to Galkhein to discuss the wedding ceremony.\u201d\n\u201cThank you,\u201d Rishe said. \u201cI\u2019m glad you kept your word.\u201d\n\u201cThe Aria Trading Company,\u201d Arnold mused. \u201cI\u2019ve heard of them. They\u2019re up-and-comers, aren\u2019t they? Have you done business with them before?\u201d\n\u201cNo, but I heard from a friend that they hold a very high standard of quality.\u201d\nRishe was pleasantly surprised at how easily Arnold had acceded to her request. Typically, a royal household had their own personal dealer. Getting them to do business with someone else could be difficult.\nI want to establish a connection with Aria as soon as possible, Rishe thought. It was, of course, the company that had taken her in during her first life.\nThe company had been established just two years prior to picking her up by its owner, a man named Tully. They were still in their growth stage, but in just a few years, they would be the grandest trading company in all the world. They\u2019d proven a great boon in her life as an apothecary as well, helping to distribute her newest medicines. She\u2019d struggled to win their trust initially, but she pledged to work much harder this time around.\nThis marriage isn\u2019t going to happen\u2014I need an escape plan for when it all falls apart. I must bring to bear all my knowledge and influence as a crown princess.\nRishe didn\u2019t know Arnold\u2019s plans, but she had no intention of sitting around and waiting for him to use her as he pleased. She\u2019d spend her time as his consort wisely. Everything must serve her ultimate goal: to live longer than five years, and live well.\nHer fierce determination must have shown on her face because Arnold gave her a little bemused smile. \u201cYes?\u201d\nGod! Rishe grimaced at that flawlessly handsome countenance. Such beauty, possessed by such powerful destruction. The fact that he\u2019d been the man to kill her did nothing to lessen her fascination. In fact, it almost made it worse. The study of contrasts.\n\u201cSorry, I just\u2014\u201d\nShe was interrupted by the horses\u2019 loud whinnies.\n\u201cStop! Hey, stop the coach!\u201d\nShouts drifted back from conveyance ahead of theirs, which contained the luggage and attendants. The squadron of knights tailing the column of coaches sped off toward the front.\n\u201cWho do you think you\u2014graaargh!\u201d\nThat didn\u2019t sound good. Rishe moved to climb out, but Arnold was faster. He drew his sword.\n\u201cHey!\u201d\nArnold locked the door from the outside. \u201cStay hidden.\u201d\nWhy is he putting himself in danger? That\u2019s what knights are for! The fact that Rishe had been about to do the same thing didn\u2019t occur to her. It\u2019s probably bandits. He told me to stay hidden in here, but I\u2019m not so sure about that.\nArnold had left her locked in from the outside, hoping to keep her safe, but Rishe didn\u2019t like her odds. There were five coaches, but this one was certainly the grandest. It locked on the inside as well, but that wouldn\u2019t stop someone with enough determination. If she did as she was told, she\u2019d just be waiting patiently for a bandit to break a window and drag her out.\nKeeping one eye on the coachmen fleeing into the forest, Rishe began a methodical search for something to help her. Right\u2014her hairpin!\nThis sure brings me back. She unfastened it, twisting it into the gap in the door. Back when I was a maid, my lady would lock herself in her chambers all the time to avoid her studies. I had to break her out just like this.\nThe lock on the coach was simple, and it came open easily. Once she was free, she scanned her surroundings. She didn\u2019t see anyone who looked immediately hostile, but there was noise up ahead. Cautiously, she headed toward it.\nBefore long, she found Arnold.\nWow.\nRoughly ten men\u2014the bandits, she presumed\u2014lay crumpled on the ground. In their midst stood Arnold, in the process of tripping",
    "query_text": " another man into the dirt. He scowled, blade at the man\u2019s throat. \u201cIs that it, then?\u201d\n\u201cGwugh!\u201d\nArnold kicked the bandit in the stomach, eyes blazing with cruelty. \u201cThat\u2019s all the thrill you offer me after I went to the trouble of drawing my sword? Barely worth it. I\u2019m bored already.\u201d\nHe wasn\u2019t angry; on the contrary, he stared his enemies down with chilly disappointment, as if this had all been a letdown. Even Arnold\u2019s own knights seemed terrified of their master when he was in a mood. Arnold smoothly flicked the blood off his sword, wiping the blade on the bandit\u2019s shirt before sheathing it. The rest of the men on the ground seemed to be unconscious.\nWait, he didn\u2019t kill anyone? Why not"

Rishe had encountered this poison several times before, curing a customer afflicted with it during her life as an apothecary.\n\u201cA lethal dose for a grown man would fill a wine glass. They likely got less than a hundredth of that,\u201d Rishe explained to Arnold, not looking up from her work. \u201cStill, the numbness can block their airways with the roots of their tongues. It\u2019s best to lay them on their sides.\u201d\n\u201cYes, I understand the theory and the solution.\u201d Arnold gazed down at Rishe\u2019s hands. \u201cThe part I\u2019m struggling with is why you\u2019re the one telling me this.\u201d\n\u201cWell, I know how to make the antidote,\u201d Rishe said patiently as she muddled the herbs together in the white soup bowl she\u2019d borrowed for her flowers. She crushed them with the back of a spoon before adding another dried flower, crushing that as well, and combining them to form a paste. This process would be easier with a pestle, but she wasn\u2019t about to complain. \u201cThis poison is common\u2014it\u2019s cheap and easy to make, which often means the antidote is simple as well.\u201d\nThe antidote was synthesized, in fact, when hunters witnessed a deer showing no symptoms after eating a certain mushroom. They tested those along with other common herbs the deer ate. Rishe mentally thanked them for their scientific rigor as she added a bit of water, straining it all through a cloth.\nRishe stood up, brandishing the bowl of bright green medicine. \u201cBoiling would make the antidote more potent, but this works in a pinch.\u201d\nThat was when she noticed the astonished stares. Unsure of what social faux paus she\u2019d perpetrated, she looked away. Oliver was completely stunned. Arnold looked thoughtful. It was imperative the knights were treated as soon as possible, but to Rishe\u2019s dismay, no one was moving. \nDo they not trust me? That makes sense. Anyone would be reluctant to use medicine concocted by a complete stranger. But the longer we wait, the harder the poison will become to cure. \nShe needed to dispel their doubts. Rolling up her sleeve, Rishe approached Arnold and drew his sword from its scabbard. \u201cI need to borrow this for a moment, Your Highness.\u201d\n\u201cWhat are you\u2014\u201d\nShe pushed the blade against the soft skin of her inner arm. Blood welled up, along with the sharp sting of pain. Nothing compared to her injuries sustained during her life as a knight, though.\nArnold did not share her nonchalance. \u201cWhat do you think you\u2019re doing?!\u201d\nHe grabbed for her arm. She stepped out of his grasp. Was blood truly so shocking? She didn\u2019t have the time to worry about it. Clutching the overfull bowl, Rishe hurried back to the knights.\n\u201cDon\u2019t worry. This isn\u2019t poison,\u201d Rishe said. She demonstrated as much by drizzling it with a spoon over her own fresh wound. It stung. That meant the ingredients were working.\n\u201cThis is crushed liquori grass, luqua flowers, and carilya nuts. I\u2019ll swallow some if that\u2019s what it takes to prove it\u2019s safe.\u201d It was horribly bitter; she hoped it wouldn\u2019t come to that. \u201cThe paralysis will last for days. Please make up your mind quickly.\u201d\n\u201cMake up our mind?\u201d\n\u201cWill you allow me to cure the poison? Or would you rather drag paralyzed soldiers all the way to Galkhein? I suppose you could waste His Highness\u2019s time searching for a hunter\u2019s settlement to use their antidote.\u201d She smiled serenely. \u201cIt makes no difference to us. Right, Your Highness?\u201d\nIn the end, Rishe applied the antidote.\nThe recovery took a few hours. While they waited, Rishe picked herbs in the same meadow she\u2019d been gazing at with yearning from the carriage. A fortuitous turn of events. She found anti-inflammatory herbs and flowers to ease sour bellies, ingredients for curing headaches, and mushrooms for inducing slumber. She wrapped them all up in a handkerchief.\nIn the meantime, Arnold dispatched a messenger to this region\u2019s lord, making arrangements to deliver the apprehended bandits. After coordinating with Oliver, he drifted over to Rishe.\n\u201cI see your interest in flowers is mercenary, rather than ornamental,\u201d he said, surveying the heaps of herbs gathered on the bank of the pond. He sat down beside her.\nWhen he didn\u2019t say anything more, Rishe went back to work plucking leaves from plants with valuable stems. The leaves had no medicinal effects, but they did make a decent broth. Slumber mushroom spores were a nuisance unless dried; they were spread out beside her in the sun.\nI wonder, would he be annoyed if I attached herbs to the roof of the coach? That would be unusual adornment for a crown prince\u2019s retinue, but it wouldn\u2019t hurt to ask.\nShe realized, quite suddenly, that Arnold was looking at her. At her hands, specifically. He sat cross-legged with his chin propped on his fist, staring absently, like a kid watching a column of ants march by.\nWhat is so fascinating about herbs?\nTheir eyes met. \u201cAm I bothering you?\u201d he asked.\nRishe shook her head slowly. \u201cNot at all. I was just curious what caught your eye.\u201d\n\u201cNothing specific. I was just thinking how very unusual you are.\u201d He was smiling again. \u201cI\u2019m looking forward to how you\u2019ll surprise me next.\u201d\nLike I\u2019m some sort of rare pet he bought to entertain him. She didn\u2019t like that. Nothing she\u2019d done was at all remarkable\u2014normal tasks performed by a normal person.\n\u201cI didn\u2019t make that antidote for your amusement.\u201d\n\u201cI realize that.\u201d The instigating smile faded from his lips. \u201cYou know, those knights you coerced into taking your home-brewed medicine were all born in the slums.\u201d\n\u201cCoerced? That\u2019s hardly the word I\u2019d use.\u201d\n\u201cGalkhein claims to value merit above all else, but in the end, people are judged by where they came from. Despite this, those men fought their way up from nothing.\u201d\nRishe paused in plucking the seeds from a flower and looked up at Arnold.\n\u201cThe men with the worst cases of the paralysis were all newly assigned. They\u2019ve spent weeks training to ensure this mission was a success. That older knight\u2014the one who bowed to you\u2014sustained an injury protecting the rookies. He cares deeply about his men.\u201d\n\u201cYou seem to care about them too,\u201d Rishe commented.\n\u201cI handpicked them for my retinue.\u201d Arnold clambered to his feet, only to fall into a bow. \u201cAnd you kept them safe. You have my deepest gratitude.\u201d\nRishe found herself at a loss for words. Was this Arnold putting on a mask to hide the monster within? Or was this the real him? She remembered the way he\u2019d looked when he held his blade to the bandit\u2019s throat, like a child poised to break a toy he had grown bored of.\n\u201cDon\u2019t mention it,\u201d Rishe said, uncomfortable. \u201cI knew how to do it, so I did.\u201d\nArnold laughed softly. \u201cBe that as it may, I\u2019d still count a noblewoman who can brew remedies from wildflowers by the side of the road a rare find.\u201d\n\u201cEarlier, when you grabbed my wrist\u2026\u201d Rishe steered the subject away from her incongruous knowledge. \u201cYou broke your promise. You said you wouldn\u2019t touch me.\u201d\n\u201cThat was reflex,\u201d Arnold protested. \u201cI thought you were going to hurt yourself.\u201d\nSuch a simple conversation, so casual. It had Rishe feeling positively peculiar.\n\u201cWhy are your knights so wary around me?\u201d she asked. \n\u201cWary? Oh, they were all at the palace when you broke your first engagement. They\u2019re most likely concerned I\u2019m bringing home a villainous jilt who will lead to my ruin. Something silly like that.\u201d\n\u201cI see.\u201d Apparently, being dumped by a prince called into question one\u2019s herbalist abilities.\n\u201cI\u2019m glad you mentioned it,\u201d Arnold went on, \u201cbecause there may be people in Galkhein who will oppose our union. I will do everything in my power to protect you, but you must bring any insults or threats to me right away.\u201d\n\u201cAre there likely to be many?\u201d\n\u201cIn theory, the crown prince may choose his own wife, but the done thing is, of course, to marry a princess. I assume a duke\u2019s daughter would have at least some ties to the royal family?\u201d\nHe assumed correctly. She was in the family tree, if a rather distant branch.\n\u201cMy father has ordered me to choose a bride from a different kingdom rather than a woman of my own land because\u2014\u201d\n\u201cOne never knows when a hostage will come in handy,\u201d Rishe finished for him.\nGalkhein was an expansionist empire. Currently, peace reigned\u2014but peace was precarious. If Galkhein demanded any of the countries to hand over a princess bride, then none were in a position to refuse. With his daughter in the hands of a foreign power, no king would dare oppose a war that power cared to wage.\n\u201cI sent a message to my father telling him I happened upon a close relation of Hermity\u2019s king\u2014a duke\u2019s daughter who had been recently tossed aside by her fianc\u00e9e,\u201d Arnold said. \u201cI also may have implied I was the reason for your falling out\u2014yours and the prince\u2019s. Why, when I saw a woman so powerful and connected and beloved, I couldn\u2019t help but plunder you.\u201d\n\u201cPlunder me? That\u2019s certainly one way to describe it.\u201d Dietrich had kicked up an almighty fuss, despite being the one who broke the engagement.\n\u201cMy father approves of you because he sees you as a bargaining chip. There will be others who aren\u2019t prepared to accept you so willingly.\u201d\n\u201cIs that so?\u201d Rishe said steadily.\n\u201cNever fear,\u201d Arnold responded. \u201cThey\u2019ll eat their words, every one of them. They will receive you as their crown princess if they value their\u2014\u201d\n\u201cNo, being a hostage is perfect.\u201d \nArnold stared at her. \u201cHm?\u201d\n\u201cAs a hostage, I\u2019ll have no official duties, will I? We can pretend I\u2019m here only under great duress, and there will be no need for my comment on governmental or diplomatic affairs.\u201d\nArnold hesitated. \u201cI suppose not.\u201d\n\u201cExcellent! Then I can live my dream of being utterly useless.\u201d Rishe trembled with delight. The thought of acting as an ambassador had really been weighing on her mind. Being a princess was nonstop work. Having been groomed for the position from an early age, Rishe knew members of the royal family barely even had time to sleep.\nBut prisoners didn\u2019t have places in government.\n\u201cThis is such a weight off my mind,\u201d Rishe admitted. \u201cThank you so much for keeping your promise, Your Highness.\u201d\n\u201cEr, of course.\u201d\n\u201cBut don\u2019t worry, I won\u2019t shirk my duties as wedding planner.\u201d Nearly ready to collapse with relief, Rishe returned to her herbs.\n \n***\n \nAfter the bandit incident, Rishe felt the knights begin to ease a bit in her presence.\nDespite their initial reluctance to accept her help, they continued to report the injured men\u2019s progress and bring any concerns directly to her. In return, they took over gathering herbs from the surrounding countryside on their rest stops.\nShe hadn\u2019t done it for gratitude, but she was nonetheless touched. Gathering medicinal herbs had been second nature ever since her life as an apothecary, and it was foolish to ever turn down loyalty.\nSeveral days after the altercation with the bandits, the coach train finally arrived in the imperial capital of Galkhein.\n\u201cOh my,\u201d Rishe murmured as they passed through the gates.\nWhite stone buildings stood in straight rows, lining clean, orderly streets. The first stories all appeared to be shops, while the second-floor windows were festooned with flowers. Everywhere she looked were smiling faces, citizens turned out to witness their prince\u2019s return over the smooth brick roads. Overlooking it all was the towering magnificence of the imperial palace.\n\u201cThe capital is the",
    "query_text": " seat of power in Galkhein,\u201d Arnold explained. \u201cSeveral key trade routes converge here.\u201d\nRishe nodded, suddenly anxious to be out of the coach. More and more people were gathering to watch their progress, some carrying shopping bags in both arms or holding hands with children. Many of them waved, as if greeting someone dear to them.\nHappy citizens and clean, orderly streets meant wealth. Galkhein was well-off. Rishe couldn\u2019t help but grin at an adorable little girl watching them roll by with sparkling eyes. When she saw Rishe\u2019s smile, she blushed and leapt up in the air, laughing with delight.\nThe coach made its way through the city before passing through the castle gates. Lines of disciplined knights flanked the road, ready to greet the crown prince and his fianc"

He had azure-blue eyes and blond hair\u2014a prince straight out of a picture book. His looks and place in the succession meant a never-ending swarm of women vying for his affections. He was brought up a pampered princeling, never wanting for anything. It manifested in a pompous manner and an overconfidence in his own abilities. Rishe had cautioned him about his attitude before, but he never paid her any mind.\nI\u2019m so glad I don\u2019t have to marry him.\nShe wished she could go"

There\u2019ll be plenty of\u2014\u201d \n\u201cIt\u2019s going to rain, is all.\u201d\nThe maids exchanged glances. \u201cHow can you be so sure?\u201d\n\u201cLook at the clouds amassing. The butterflies and the bees are flying low. The moisture in the air will make the drying take longer.\u201d\n\u201cWhat?\u201d\nAnother maid spoke up in a soft voice. \u201cDiana, you were the one who said we should take the initiative to wash the bigger pieces. You said the crown prince would choose us for his household!\u201d\n\u201cStop putting the blame on me! This isn\u2019t my fault.\u201d An indignant flush crept over the redhead\u2019s face. \u201cThere\u2019s no way some upstart can tell what time it\u2019s going to rain! The weather is going to be fantastic all day. Come on, we\u2019re hauling these over to the wash!\u201d\nThe three girls meekly followed Diana.\nRishe sighed, turning to the blonde girl. \u201cAre you hurt?\u201d\n\u201cNo, I\u2019m fine.\u201d The girl\u2019s gaze darted around nervously. \u201cI\u2019m Elsie. Thank you for helping me.\u201d Her face was studiously blank, but from the way she struggled with her words, Rishe could tell she was being genuine.\n\u201cDon\u2019t worry about it,\u201d Rishe said. \u201cYour uniform seems to have fared less well.\u201d\n\u201cOh no.\u201d Elsie looked down at herself. Her face remained vacant, but she seemed sad. \u201cAnd I just got it.\u201d \n\u201cYou can get the dirt out if you wash it straight away. It\u2019s going to rain, but this dress should dry quickly. Use lots of soap, but don\u2019t scrub it by hand\u2014scrape the mud off with a brush.\u201d\n\u201cWhy a brush?\u201d\n\u201cBecause your fingers will just grind dirt into the threads. A brush is more porous.\u201d\nThe young sons of the family Rishe served spent their time tumbling in the dirt, and she had plenty of experience scraping mud out of clothes. She could even salvage dirty socks that had spent days crumpled in the corner.\n\u201cDo you\u2026 Are you\u2026\u201d Elsie trailed off, blinking rapidly a couple of times before finally looking Rishe in the eyes. \u201cAre you the crown princess\u2019s maid?\u201d\nUnsure how to answer, Rishe couldn\u2019t meet her eyes.\n \n***\n \nAfter parting ways with Elsie, Rishe returned to the detached wing with her fresh water. She put clean sheets on the bed the knights had installed, satisfied that she had a comfortable place to sleep. This room also had the highest-up balcony in the whole detached palace.\nTaking a break, she wandered out onto the balcony and looked off over the capital, the golden afternoon tinged with the onset of twilight. The day was fresh with a recent rain, the air clear enough to see for miles. The spring breeze felt good against her skin, sweaty from cleaning. Rishe leaned against the railing, leaning her head back and closing her eyes.\nShe felt like collapsing into bed immediately, but she desperately needed a wash. Still, she didn\u2019t want to pull herself away from the view and the breeze just yet. When she resumed gazing out absentmindedly, something her mother once said drifted back to her. \n\u201cRishe, there is no need for you to think for yourself.\u201d\nShe frowned, the memories coming thick and fast now.\n\u201cYou mustn\u2019t forget that the duty of our family is to live our lives fully devoted to the kings of the land. You\u2019re smart, but all the thinking in the world won\u2019t do a woman any good. You need only concern yourself with how best to serve the crown prince.\u201d\n\u201cStudies? Focus on social etiquette\u2014that\u2019s what you need for navigating high society. The crown prince\u2019s bride must be flawless. Your smile is lacking. You must always strive to appear amiable.\u201d\nRishe breathed out a long sigh. When I was fifteen, their lectures were the only thing I thought about.\nHer parents preached constantly. \u201cA woman\u2019s true happiness is to marry a suitable man and give birth to his heirs.\u201d\n\u201cBut, Mother\u2026\u201d\nObjection was not permitted. Any argument was immediately dispensed with. As a woman, Rishe could not inherit her father\u2019s title. Her only value was in her marriage. \nDespite knowing now that the opinions of others were as worthless as empty titles, the words still echoed in her memories.\nRishe\u2019s fingertips twitched, and she opened her eyes. Unmoving, she said, \u201cShouldn\u2019t you be seeing to your duties?\u201d\n\u201cMore hidden depths, I see,\u201d came a voice tinged with pleasure. Rishe straightened and turned. There was Arnold, leaning against the door to the balcony. \u201cYou seem able to sense my approach no matter how far or how hard I try.\u201d\n\u201cYou\u2019re quite naughty, aren\u2019t you? You\u2019ve been making your presence known little by little, emanating threat, to see how quickly I catch on.\u201d\n\u201cSo you noticed that as well.\u201d Arnold joined Rishe on the balcony. She tensed, but all he did was cast a curious glance at the view. \u201cWhat were you looking at?\u201d\n\u201cThe city.\u201d Rishe was hardly going to tell him she\u2019d been looking at nothing, merely ruminating on her mother\u2019s overbearing advice. The view from the balcony was spectacular, though. \u201cWhat\u2019s that over there?\u201d\n\u201cYou mean the library? The state invested funds to expand it. We have books from all over the world.\u201d\n\u201cReally? You have a library that big?\u201d Rishe\u2019s eyes sparkled with delight. She pointed out another building. \u201cWhat about that spire? It\u2019s beautiful.\u201d\n\u201cThe church and clock tower. The bells ring out the hour.\u201d\n\u201cOoh, how wonderful! And it looks like there\u2019s a rather big market there too?\u201d\n\u201cYes, the largest market in the city. Carts line up in the early morning. Most of the offerings are made fresh every day.\u201d\n\u201cAmazing! And what about that pretty mountain over there?\u201d\nRishe tried and failed to contain her excitement. She couldn\u2019t help but imagine what seeing all these places up close would be like. The grand library, the beautiful church that told the time, and the morning market with fresh, delicious food\u2014she wanted to experience it all.\nSeeing Arnold\u2019s bemused face, she said, \u201cWhat?\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m just wondering where all this interest is coming from,\u201d he said. \u201cYou were so reluctant to come, yet here you are, brimming with curiosity for my city.\u201d\n\u201cWell\u2026\u201d she trailed off, unsure of how to respond.\nWhat should I say? Should I just tell him the truth?\nThis wasn\u2019t a secret, but talking about her hopes and dreams to the man who had killed her was a little awkward. A strange self-consciousness settled on her, her cheeks heating as she mumbled, \u201cBecause I\u2019ve always wanted to.\u201d\nArnold looked at her keenly. \u201cWanted to what?\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019ve always wanted to come here.\u201d\nDuring her life as a merchant, Rishe developed her single dream to visit everywhere in the world. That dream was cut tragically short when only one country remained: Galkhein.\nIn each of her consecutive lives, Rishe\u2019s priority became staying alive. Every time, without fail, just as she found her footing, the world was plunged into chaos. She never had the chance to see Galkhein. This betrothal was her chance. \u201cIt\u2019s probably why I agreed to marry you,\u201d she added after a moment\u2019s hesitation.\nArnold swept a tepid glance over the city. \u201cThere\u2019s nothing here worth seeing.\u201d\n\u201cThat\u2019s not true! The places you just told me about sound amazing! Your citizens are clean and happy, your knights are proper and kind. Oh, and another\u2014\u201d \nRishe broke off enumerating Galkhein\u2019s charms as Arnold turned to look at her. His face was impassively calm, but something seemed to pass by underneath, like a shadow in deep water.\n\u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d Rishe said. \u201cDid I say something odd?\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m just amazed you could be so unaware of yourself.\u201d \nWh-what a rude thing to\u2014\n\u201cI\u2019ve never met anyone like you. No one has ever spoken to me the way you do. I don\u2019t know any girls of your class with the knowledge or the physical abilities you possess. Noblewomen don\u2019t concern themselves with such things.\u201d\nRishe, there is no need for you to think for yourself.\nShe frowned. \u201cPerhaps you\u2019re right, but everything I\u2019ve",
    "query_text": " learned is precious to me. No one can take my skills away\u2014I value them with my life. Some may say that my knowledge is worthless, but it makes no difference to me.\u201d She turned from the balcony, fixing him with a piercing gaze. \u201cI\u2019m the one who decides what I value.\u201d\nRis"

His good looks only compounded it\u2014he was so handsome that every expression was stark.\nHe looks more like Emperor Arnold Hein now, but still not the same.\nArnold appeared to notice her watching him. When he looked at her, his sourness disappeared, replaced by a genuine smile. All around him, women found themselves flushing. Arnold paid no heed to their fervent gazes, instead leaning in to give Rishe a brief moment of consideration.\nThen he leaned in close enough to kiss her.\n\u201cA dull trip,\u201d he said again, pulling away. \u201cBut fortuitous. Without it, I would have never met the woman destined to be my wife.\u201d\nA shocked murmur rolled through the crowd. Rishe, who hadn\u2019t recovered from seeing Arnold\u2019s beautiful face at close range, barely noticed the looks of utter loathing the assembled women were throwing her.\n\u201cH-His Highness is smiling? At his hostage bride?\u201d\n\u201cHe called her his wife?! He\u2019s never even looked at us!\u201d\nThey were whispers, but they carried.\nA portly man stepped forward with his daughter in tow. \u201cYour Highness, do you mean to say that this lovely young woman is your fianc\u00e9e?\u201d\nEvery eye in the ballroom was on Rishe, alight with curiosity, envy, or schemes. None of them could hide their contempt. But Rishe didn\u2019t falter.\nThis is nothing compared to being publicly dumped in a banquet hall. And I\u2019ve done that seven times!\nShe offered a polite smile and an astoundingly correct curtsy. Left leg at a diagonal behind the right, back straight, head bowed. \u201cHow do you do? My name is Rishe Irmgard Weitzner.\u201d\nEven the most hostile guests could find nothing impolite in her greeting, no sign of rough manners from the rustic daughter of a backwater nation. Rishe had years of training in expectation of ascending to the throne. Occasionally, habits from her other lives slipped through, but Arnold appeared to be the only one who noticed.\nNow he was looking at her with satisfaction. \u201cLady Rishe has only just arrived, and her acquaintances are few and far between. I hope I can count on you all to hold me accountable should I prove an incompetent husband.\u201d\n\u201cB-but of course, Your Highness.\u201d\n\u201cCome, Rishe.\u201d Arnold guided her out of the ring of spectators. The stares continued to follow them as they walked away.\nRishe dropped her voice to a whisper. \u201cYou sure know how to invite the ire of women.\u201d\n\u201cWhatever do you mean?\u201d\n\u201cThe way you harped on about me. Everything you said was tailor-made to stoke their jealousy. You\u2019ve gained me enemies, so thanks for that.\u201d\nArnold snorted. \u201cEverything I said was to protect you from enemies. They need to know you aren\u2019t just some trophy they can eliminate without recourse. We need to show them this to forestall any potential moves against you in the future.\n\u201cShow them what, exactly?\u201d\n\u201cThat I\u2019ll protect you no matter what.\u201d\nHe said it with such nonchalance that it brought her up short. Protect me? Arnold Hein, protect me?\nSuch an ironic position to take. She couldn\u2019t tell him that, of course. Her response came out somewhat strangled. \u201cI doubt they\u2019ll be anything to worry about. In fact, the biggest threat facing me is you.\u201d\n\u201cOh? And why do you say that?\u201d\n\u201cFor many reasons, the most obvious being that I\u2019m no match for you with a blade.\u201d As much as it pained her to admit it.\nArnold looked pleased. \u201cPerhaps we should duel.\u201d\n\u201cYes, please! And if it wouldn\u2019t be an intrusion\u2014I would like to train with you.\u201d If she studied him, she could learn his strategies and his attack patterns. She\u2019d never be a match in speed or raw power, but any insight would be invaluable.\n\u201cSure.\u201d Arnold shrugged. \u201cI don\u2019t mind.\u201d\n\u201cTruly?\u201d Her eyes glittered with anticipation.\nHe chuckled. \u201cYour answers never disappoint me.\u201d\n\u201cWhat\u2019s that supposed to mean? Oh, it looks like they\u2019re playing a new song.\u201d\nA soft melody drifted across the hall. The crowd divided, heading toward the center of the floor or against the wall. The next dance was starting, and everyone was waiting to see what the crown prince and his new fianc\u00e9e would do.\n\u201cWe don\u2019t have to dance if you don\u2019t want to,\u201d Arnold said.\n\u201cOh? As it happens, I like dancing.\u201d Plus, she couldn\u2019t resist a blatant challenge. She offered him her hand.\n\u201cVery well, then.\u201d Arnold only hesitated for a moment before taking it and steering her gently to an empty spot on the floor. He didn\u2019t seem like the dancing type, but his movements were slick and effortless. Facing one another, they joined hands. Arnold wrapped his other arm around her waist. \nOoh. His hand felt huge against her back. She realized she was breathing a little faster. They\u2019d never been this close before.\nNo, that isn\u2019t quite true. This is the second time. Rishe\u2019s final memories from her last life flashed vividly through her mind.\nThis was indeed the second time they had been this close\u2014the first had ended with a sword through her chest.\nEmperor Arnold Hein had single-handedly decimated the knights in the castle. Rishe stood in the midst of the carnage, breath ragged as she gripped the hilt of her sword, slick with her own blood. She was the last line of defense. The chamber behind her housed the royal family.\nIf they could reach the hidden passageways, the young prince and his party could find shelter with their allies across the border. Rishe and the other knights were prepared to sacrifice their lives to allow the royal family to survive. Their escape meant victory.\nBells tolled out, urging flight. All is lost. Run. Rishe managed to graze Arnold\u2019s cheek with her blade before she looked down to find his jet-black sword blooming out of her chest.\nShe remembered how it burned, as if the blade was made of fire. It was heat, not pain, but her breathing grew labored, and when Emperor Arnold Hein withdrew his sword, Rishe crumpled. \nHe knelt by her side and whispered something.\nThe words were seared into her memory. Rishe squeezed Arnold\u2019s hand as they danced.\nI\u2019ll be the bully this time. \nRishe shifted her weight back, slipping out of the hold on her waist. She broke Arnold\u2019s lead and spun, drifting on the harmony of the dance. She took him by surprise; his eyes went wide.\nI wonder what you\u2019ll do when you\u2019re no longer on top, Your Highness. Her smile was a declaration of war. Watching him attempt to follow her lead would be delightful. She pulled his hand toward her, attempting to move them into a spin.\nBut Arnold held fast. He planted his hand on her waist and turned them in a different direction, using her inertia against her. Hey! As a result, Rishe twirled by herself on the spot.\nShe didn\u2019t miss a step. She turned elegantly, the hem of her dress whispering across the ballroom floor. She heard appreciative murmurs from the wallflowers lined up watching.\nDespite that, Rishe took it as a defeat. Round one to Arnold. \nSo\u2026you can think on your feet. How about this?\nArnold remained unruffled, evading her next scheme like it was nothing. He grinned down at her, his eyes shining with a dare.\nHe thinks I can\u2019t beat him. His ease vexed her, but it was his smugness that made her angry.\nShe let out a hard breath, attempting a maneuver to lure him in while turning. He leaned back, not falling for it at all.\nHe\u2019s just too good at changing his center of gravity! She kept her astonishment under wraps, but she felt it. Despite how close we\u2019re dancing, I can\u2019t throw off his timing at all. He\u2019s sidestepped all my attempts, and he takes back the lead the second I let down my guard!\nIt made her increasingly angry. She twirled and stepped as the dance dictated, all the while feeling out for moments of weakness. Arnold played along with her game, completely unruffled.\nEvery single time. I\u2019m doing my utmost to trip him up, but he doesn\u2019t even seem annoyed! At this point she\u2019d just settle for any reaction at all.\nTheir unusual dance style had gathered a crowd. Rishe paid them no mind, focused only on her goal. Then something occurred to her, and her breath caught in her throat.\nWait a minute, he has left an opening. It\u2019s the same one from before. She thought back to their fight to the death, to that moment when she had managed to draw blood. That may indeed have been his only weakness.\nIf I strike the same way\u2014huh? Before she could try, Arnold appeared to lose patience, wrapping his arm around her waist. He bent her back into a dip so deep it felt like he\u2019d pulled a carpet from under her feet. She yelped, grabbing at him reflexively, clinging tight. His big hands gripped her securely enough to mitigate the sensation of falling. Relief flooded through her, and she felt a laugh rumble against her ear.\nThe music came to an end with one last ringing note. She blinked. The dance is over?\nA hush fell over the ballroom. Then cheers broke out, followed by a round of applause.\n\u201cThat was incredible!\u201d\nThe watching nobles crowded in.\n\u201cYou two moved in such perfect harmony!\u201d\n\u201cI was on the edge of my seat. I felt like I was watching a sword duel!\u201d\n\u201cIs this a dance from Hermity? I\u2019ve never seen such steps before.\u201d\n\u201cUh, well\u2026\u201d Rishe floundered. She glanced up at Arnold, who appeared to be enjoying her struggle. She\u2019d get no help from him.\nRishe dealt with the barrage of questions as best she could, letting the crowd sweep them into the dining room, which was set up for a buffet-style meal. She made sure to greet every guest, riveting their faces into her memory.\nShe must have been acting peculiar, because Arnold eventually said, \u201cRishe, I think the wine is getting to you. Shall we get some fresh air?\u201d\nRishe hadn\u2019t touched a single drop. In fact, she\u2019d been caught up in so many conversations that she hadn\u2019t even had the chance to eat, but she had experience working on an empty stomach. She accepted Arnold\u2019s encouragement as the escape it was.\nJust when I least expect it, he\u2019ll act the gentleman. Maybe he\u2019d remembered her demand for a carefree life of doing nothing.\nRishe cast a charming look across the crowd. \u201cThank you for your consideration, Your Highness. Forgive me.\u201d She gave a polite bow before quietly slipping away. \nShe didn\u2019t head straight to the balcony but rather slowly walked around the hall. There was only so much she could find out glued to Arnold\u2019s side all night.\nI need information. Galkhein\u2019s political landscape was a mystery to me through all my past lives. I only know the rumors that made it abroad.\nAlthough she knew of Arnold\u2019s eventual patricide, she had no concept of the circumstances leading up to it. She needed a better picture of the factions and power balance inside the court. The lives these people led.\nI know better than to believe wartime gossip. This Arnold Hein is a lot different from what I\u2019d heard he was like at nineteen. He\u2019s not as diabolical as the rumors led me to believe. He likes to push, but he isn\u2019t unkind. The thought drifted across her mind, leaving her conflicted. Well, he\u2019s not unkind now. But I still don\u2019t like not knowing his motives. And he\u2019s a bit of a jerk, to be honest. \nShe tried to settle her mind and just observe. Gathering intelligence was necessary to lead a long, carefree life lazing around the palace.\nIf I recall correctly, that\u2019s Lord Hannawald. He seems to be on good terms with Count Gayle. Duke Hudemann and Duke Teinitz are having a friendly enough conversation, yet they don\u2019t seem close. Rishe ticked off the names of people she\u2019d met, committing them to memory.\nA wave of sweet perfume wafted over her. A pretty girl with soft blonde hair had appeared at her side. \u201cHow do you do, Lady Rishe? I\u2019m Cornelia Thea Toona.\u201d\nDuke Toona\u2019s family was the thirty-first house she\u2019d met tonight.\nRishe smiled graciously. \u201cRishe Irmgard Weitzner. A pleasure to meet you.\u201d\n\u201cThe pleasure is all mine.\u201d Cornelia smiled sweetly. Her eyes were big and bright, her lips full. She held a glass in each hand and offered one to Rishe. \u201cWine? I see you\u2019re empty-handed.\u201d\nA gaggle of other ladies nearby began giggling among themselves.\n\u201cHow dare she act so haughty when she\u2019s a captive. It\u2019s time for her learn just what she is. A pawn to be played and discarded.\u201d\n\u201cShe should enjoy her time on Prince Arnold\u2019s arm while she can.\u201d\n\u201cShe is from a minor nation, after all.\u201d\nAs Rishe took note of their whispers, Cornelia gazed at her with doe eyes. \u201cDoes my offering offend you in some way?\u201d\nIf I remember correctly, House Toona holds a vast territory in southern Galkhein.\nRishe held out a hand to accept the glass. \u201cHow could it? Thank you, Lady Cornelia.\u201d\nBefore Rishe could touch the glass, Cornelia gave a dramatic shout. \u201cOh dear! My hand slipped!\u201d She dropped it, quite obviously on purpose. Without thinking, Rishe grabbed her skirts and leaned back, plucking the glass out of the air with the other hand.\nCornelia let out a cry of surprise as Rishe caught the wine before any could spill. She swirled the glass and brought it to her nose to breathe in the bouquet.\nHmm\u2026 That\u2019s mashed capsicum. Where did she even get that? What a waste of perfectly good wine. And why bother spicing it enough to singe the tongue if she just planned to ruin my dress? Pick a plan, my dear.\nHiding her exasperation, Rishe smiled brightly. \u201cI\u2019ve never had a wine quite like this. What an unusual scent.\u201d\nCornelia bit her lip in frustration. Rishe beamed at her. You\u2019ve got such a pretty face, Lady Toona. Why don\u2019t you smile?\nRishe leaned in close to Cornelia. \u201cThis vintage isn\u2019t available where I\u2019m from. I\u2019m ever so anxious to learn more. Should I perhaps invite Prince Arnold over to enjoy a glass? Which tray did you get this from?\u201d\n\u201cWhat? Oh, um\u2026\u201d Rishe had a policy of never backing down from a fight, but it seemed Cornelia didn\u2019t share it. \u201cS-sorry, but I don\u2019t remember. Such a large hall, you see.\u201d\n\u201cA shame. I\u2019ll just give His Highness this one, then. I\u2019ll be sure to let him know who it\u2019s from.\u201d\n\u201cUh, wait!\u201d Cornelia rapidly shook her head. \u201cI-I got that glass for you, so I think you should\u2014you know what? Never mind! Maybe I should just take that\u2014oh no!\u201d\nRishe ignored the ashen-faced Cornelia, raising the",

I do hope the two of us can spend more time together. Perhaps\u2026a tea party?\u201d\n\u201cTh-the two of us?\u201d Cornelia stammered.\n\u201cYes. I want to know all about House Toona.\u201d\nCornelia looked flabbergasted, but she recovered herself and nodded.\nThat should do. One of Rishe\u2019s eventual plans required a plot of land in a temperate climate. House Toona\u2019s would likely be perfect, but she needed to confirm a few things with Cornelia.

    "prefix_text": "I need to sow a plot of land, grow herbs, do lots of shopping, get cheap alcohol, and then\u2026 \nRishe began a to-do list that had nothing to do with war in the least.\n \n***\n \nAs the ball wound to a close, a lone boy stood in the gloomy courtyard of the imperial palace. He had soft black hair and round blue eyes. No older than sixteen, he had an androgynous grace to him, gaze fixed on the balcony above. \nHe was watching a girl.\nShe had coral-colored hair, and even from this distance, he could tell she was beautiful. She stood there alone, apparently waiting for someone. Whoever it was must have shown up because her hand slipped from the banister, and she stepped away. Not too long after, a man appeared where she had been standing.\nThe man turned a silent glare down into the garden, as if he\u2019d known the boy had been there the whole time, despite the shadows.\nA shiver ran down the boy\u2019s spine and he smiled reflexively, delighting in the intense aura of threat the man gave off. It was just a warning, it seemed, as the man abruptly turned on his heel and disappeared. \n\u201cAww, we can\u2019t play together either?\u201d The boy hung his head. \u201cI miss you, Brother.\u201d\nIt had to be the woman. The beauty. She\u2019d made the boy\u2019s life hell since the day she arrived. \nHis brother had prohibited him from attending balls like this one. That was fine; he\u2019d sooner avoid them altogether. Still, he\u2019d wanted to meet that girl. \n\u201cBut we\u2019ll meet soon enough, won\u2019t we?\u201d He spoke to himself in a soft voice. \u201cI\u2019ve got plans for you, Sister.\u201d \n\n(2) chapter number given is likely out of range: 0\nChapter: 8\n\nChapter 3\nChapter 3\n \n\u201cYOU\u2019RE ALL SO USELESS!\u201d Diana the redheaded maid\u2019s voice rang out inside the stone washhouse. \nThree days had passed since the afternoon Rishe shook off her guard and came out to the well. Rishe was once again dressed to fit in with the maids. At Diana\u2019s shout, she looked up without pausing in her work. \n\u201cIs even laundry beyond your capabilities? I asked you to wash these this morning, and now it\u2019s past noon! Meanwhile, we\u2019ve finished cleaning the entire first floor in a third of the time!\u201d\n\u201cI-I\u2019m sorry, Diana.\u201d\nThe new maids went silent with shame. Among them was Elsie, the girl Rishe stood up for the other day. Rishe pulled her hands out of the soapy water, gently rinsed them, and said, \u201cLet me help. What still needs to be done?\u201d\n\u201cYou again?\u201d Diana rounded on Rishe. \u201cI don\u2019t know who you serve, but I\u2019m amazed you have the time to do other people\u2019s work. I wish I had so much free time.\u201d\nHuffily, she turned from Rishe. \u201cLet\u2019s just ignore these useless fools. Laura, Maya. Come on. If we want to be chosen as Lady Rishe\u2019s maids, we mustn\u2019t waste our time.\u201d\nDiana took out a slip of paper from her pocket, smoothing it out. \u201cIt looks like the new bedsheets for her palace will arrive today. We should inspect them to make sure everything is perfect!\u201d\n\u201cWait up, Diana!\u201d\nThe two maids followed Diana out. Rishe waited for the door to close before turning to Elsie and the others. \u201cLet\u2019s keep working. If there\u2019s anything too large and cumbersome, feel free to pass it over to me.\u201d\n\u201cTh-thank you so much!\u201d The new maids went weak with gratitude. One of them, a girl on the verge of tears, even fell into a full bow. Rishe muttered encouragement as she scrubbed some bedsheets.\nElsie, who was washing the sheets with her, wore a rueful look. \u201cI\u2019m so sorry for the trouble. We\u2019re just not learning fast enough.\u201d\n\u201cYou haven\u2019t been working here long, have you? It takes time to learn a new job, no matter who you are,\u201d Rishe said as she kept scrubbing. \u201cAnd it\u2019s not like you\u2019ve never washed a single thing in your life before, right?\u201d\nElsie nodded nervously. \nRishe had realized over the past few days doing the laundry that not all the newcomers were complete amateurs. They\u2019d obviously done chores at home, or something similar. When set a specific task, they could perform it properly, but Diana\u2019s complaints weren\u2019t unfounded. They did take far too much time with laundry.\nBut it\u2019s obvious why. \u201cDo you know anything about Diana?\u201d Rishe asked Elsie. \u201cLike, is she from a well-off family?\u201d\nElsie said, \u201cI heard that her father was a business owner. She worked with him.\u201d\n\u201cI heard that as well,\u201d added another maid. \u201cBut he fell into debt and had to sell off.\u201d \nRishe stopped scrubbing for a moment to consider this.\n\u201cUm, is something the matter?\u201d Elsie asked.\nRishe smiled and shook her head. \u201cNo, nothing. Let\u2019s just focus on getting these washed for the time being.\u201d\n \n***\n \nThat afternoon, thirty maids were assembled in the detached wing of the palace. Ten of them were old hands, long in service to the royal family, while the other twenty were freshly hired. The crown princess was to choose her maids from among these thirty. They wore their nerves plainly on their sleeves. \n\u201cHey, I thought this palace was in a terrible state of neglect,\u201d one maid whispered. \u201cWhy is it so sparkling clean?\u201d\n\u201cYeah, you\u2019re right,\u201d said another. \u201cSomeone must have sorted it out before we arrived.\u201d\n\u201cI wonder what kind of person Lady Rishe is. Ooh, I\u2019m so nervous.\u201d\nThe girls looked around anxiously.\n\u201cHey, Elsie, that girl who was always helping us isn\u2019t here.\u201d\nElsie blinked. \u201cYou\u2019re right.\u201d\n\u201cLook, Diana. That impertinent newbie didn\u2019t get picked.\u201d \nAt her friend\u2019s observation, Diana preened with satisfaction. \u201cNo surprise there. You need some manners to attend to Lady Rishe. I bet she got kicked out of the running!\u201d Her eyes sparkled with confidence.\nAt last, there was a knock at the door.\n\u201cHer Royal Highness, Princess Rishe.\u201d\nThe maids quickly fell into bows. Diana\u2019s chest ached with anticipation as heels clicked on the floor, approaching the",
    "query_text": " line of girls. From the corner of their eyes, the maids saw a wide-skirted court dress. A gentle scent washed over them.\nWithout even looking at her, they could tell Crown Princess Rishe was a lovely woman. Diana and her friends swelled with pride that she was to become their mistress.\nBut then Laura whispered to Diana, \u201cHey, isn\u2019t this scent familiar?\u201d\n\u201cQuiet!\u201d Clearly it was some sort of expensive perfume. Or so Diana thought, but then she realized what it was. The words just slipped out. \u201cIt\u2019s soap.\u201d\n\u201cHuh? Did you just say something?\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s soap. The same kind we always use.\u201d Diana was sure of it.\nThe princess said, \u201cPlease rise.\u201d \nWhy did her voice sound so familiar? An incredible foreboding"

Thus ended her second life. \nOnce again, she found herself in the moment of her broken engagement, the curtain rising on the third loop. Her next four lives proceeded much the same way. As a skilled lady\u2019s maid, she helped a young noblewoman to a fortuitous marriage. Once, she even disguised herself as a man and became a knight. Every life was worth living, and she enjoyed them all. She enjoyed living, period.\nThere was just one problem.\nNo matter what I do, I die at twenty.\nShe enjoyed her lives, but she was not permitted to do so for long. With this time limit always hanging over her, she spent each loop in a state of constant activity.\nI would love to take it easy for a while. Is a little leisure time too much to ask? Obviously I don\u2019t want to die either! This time, I\u2019ll make as much money as I can in the first five years. Then, when I turn twenty, I\u2019ll live a life free of worldly cares. I\u2019ll do whatever\u2019s necessary to stay alive!\nHer mind made up, Rishe began her seventh life in a dead sprint through the palace. Regardless of her future plans, she was in a race against time. She needed to beat the messenger bearing news of her scandal.\nAs she ran, she yanked off her hair ornaments; she planned to sell them and didn\u2019t want to risk losing one. Her hair billowed out behind her, falling in loose waves.\nSuddenly, an idea occurred to her, one she hadn\u2019t had in any of her previous six lives.\nLeaving through the palace gardens would be faster. I can climb down a tree from the balcony.\nRishe had gone to war as a knight in the life just before this one. After the punishing battlefield training, climbing trees was nothing.\nSeamlessly, she changed direction. She raced for the balcony, where she ran into something at full speed.\n\u201cBwargh!\u201d Rishe let out a very unladylike grunt, staggering a few steps. She looked up to see what she\u2019d bounced off of. \u201cOh\u2026\u201d\nAn exceptionally handsome man stood in her path.\nHe had refined, patrician features and cruel, thin lips. He was slender yet powerful; even through his clothes, Rishe could tell his body was well conditioned. His jet-black hair covered his ears, creeping down to the nape of his neck. The tips of his locks bounced with his movements. They looked to be soft to the touch.\nFrom head to toe, he was a pleasure to look at\u2014but what held Rishe\u2019s attention were his eyes. They were long in shape and impossibly blue, but they possessed a blade-sharp intensity. His gaze was clear, beautiful, and cold as ice. His eyelashes cast shadows on his striking face. He was a work of art.\nCurrently, this work of art was staring her down with a look that could kill.\nHe laughed. \u201cYou barreled right into me. For a moment, I thought I\u2019d been attacked by a wild boar.\u201d\nIt was an exceedingly rude thing to say to a stranger, but as luck would have it, this man was not a stranger. At least not to Rishe.\n\u201cWhat are you even doing here?\u201d the man went on. \u201cThe party is in the\u2014\u201d\nRishe interrupted him with a wordless shout of dismay. The man drew back, reflexively reaching for his sword. He composed himself with visible difficulty. \u201cWho are you? You look like any noblewoman, but your manner is\u2026\u201d \n\u201cEmperor Arnold Hein!\u201d \nThe man\u2019s eyes widened. He didn\u2019t mistake her surging contempt. Rishe had crossed swords with this man. Recently. He was the one responsible for ending her sixth life. \nHe must be a guest at the banquet. It makes sense.\nArnold Hein was the scion of a military nation not far from Rishe\u2019s home country of Hermity, the one in which they now stood. Their kingdoms, so recently at war, had brokered an ostensible peace, and the two ruling families met from time to time. Crown Prince Dietrich\u2019s engagement party would be one such occasion. He\u2019d gathered elites from far and wide to introduce to his beloved Mary.\nThe man eyed Rishe with rising curiosity. \u201cYou know me? This is my first time in Hermity.\u201d\nUh-oh. Rishe pasted on a smile as her mind spun in circles. This man was dangerous. She had to avoid entanglements with him at all costs. Five years from now, Arnold Hein would invade Hermity. \nHe was an extraordinarily skilled swordsman and, with a powerful military at his back, was destined to conquer kingdom after kingdom. He had done as much in her second, third, fourth, and fifth lives. In her sixth, Rishe had faced him in battle herself and died by his hand.\nWe never had a chance. That war was lost before it began.\nArnold\u2019s brilliance lay not in his swordplay but in his skill as a tactician. He set countries up for conquest and knocked them down, swallowing them one by one.\nI know him, but he doesn\u2019t know me. We haven\u2019t met in this life. I need an excuse fast. \nRishe curtsied slowly. \u201cMy name is Rishe Irmgard Weitzner. We\u2019ve never been introduced, but I\u2019ve heard of you.\u201d\nArnold donned an amused smile. \u201cYou plant your weight like a trained swordswoman. Your center of gravity is perfect.\u201d\n\u201cYou exaggerate,\u201d Rishe demurred. \u201cThat was simply a curtsy to an esteemed guest.\u201d \n\u201cI must have misheard, but I swear you called me \u2018emperor\u2019 just now.\u201d \nRishe froze.\n\u201cMy father yet lives,\u201d Arnold said. \u201cI am simply a crown prince. Why would you call me that?\u201d \n\u201cUh, um\u2026\u201d Rishe floundered for an answer.\nShe\u2019d made such a foolish mistake. Arnold\u2019s gaze cut right through her. It felt like he\u2019d see through any lie she told right down to her soul. She remembered this from the battlefield\u2014how his attention alone felt like a sword thrust.\nBut why even bother to lie? They\u2019d never meet again, so who cared what he thought of her? Sure, she harbored a hard feeling or two over the recent slaying, but there was no point complaining about it to this Arnold. Calling him the emperor was boorish, but Rishe was in the process of being forcibly exiled. Why play at diplomacy?\nShe took a deep breath and bowed low. This was not the curtsy of a noble lady but of a servant bowing in supplication to her master.\n\u201cMy humblest apologies, Your Highness. I was in a rush. Such a rude slip of the tongue.\u201d She raised her head. \u201cMy ex-fianc\u00e9 just annulled our engagement, so I\u2019ve got a lot on my mind. If you would excuse me.\u201d \n\u201cHe annulled your engagement?\u201d\nAt that, Rishe turned and fled.\nThis unexpected run-in with Arnold had taken up valuable time. She threw open the door to the balcony and hiked up her skirts, kicking off her shoes in anticipation of jumping into a tree. Looking down, she realized the ground was far closer than she\u2019d feared.\nExcellent! I can just drop into the garden!\nArnold, who up until now had been rendered speechless, shook himself out of his fugue as Rishe clambered over the railing. \u201cHey!\u201d\nRishe\u2019s moonlight-silver dress flowed around her as she leapt. The lawn was soft, but the fall was still far enough to risk injury.\nWeight evenly distributed on the soles of my feet, roll to transfer the impact to my shins and thighs, then onto my hips and my back.\nShe landed safely, rolled nimbly in her dress, and popped back up. Her hair was covered in leaves. \nI need to hurry up!\nBracing against a nearby rock, she used her weight to snap the heels off of her shoes. There. That would make running a little easier. Satisfied, she slipped them back on and made haste toward the family estate. \n \n***\n \nUp on the balcony, Crown Prince Arnold of Galkhein watched the spectacle play out from beginning to end. He gazed at the girl with the coral hair. Her appearance was that of any young noblewoman, but she moved like a well-trained knight. She\u2019d leapt from the balcony and landed skillfully, showing no signs of distress at her ripped dress or disheveled hair. Instead, she\u2019d knocked the heels off her shoes and dashed away.\nAlso, she had called him an emperor.\nPlaying it all over again in his head, Arnold broke out into a rare chuckle. As his shoulders quivered with laughter, his attendant approached him from behind.\n\u201cThere you are, Your Highness. What are you doing out here? I\u2019m aware you don\u2019t desire a wife, but beginning the search would be wise\u2026 Er, Your Highness?\u201d The attendant\u2019s eyes flew wide. His bored and scowling master was laughing. \u201cDid something happen?\u201d\n\u201cOliver, ready my coach. Wait, no. That will take too much time. Bring me a horse.\u201d\n\u201cAt once, Your Highness. Might I ask why?\u201d\nArnold didn\u2019t respond\u2014he just grinned like a hungry wolf catching scent of his prey.\n \n***\n \nOnce outside the palace gates, Rishe threw herself into the waiting coach, shouting for the driver to make haste. She stopped it a few hundred yards from the manor and bid him farewell. \u201cI\u2019m leaving! Thanks for always being such a safe driver, Daniel!\u201d\nThe road to the manor was muddy from a morning rain shower. She knew from her second life that the coach would get stuck, resulting in a loss of valuable time. It was better to just get out and run. \n\u201cHuff, huff.\u201d Despite her last life\u2019s physical conditioning, this body had no stamina. She\u2019d need to try to get fitter faster this time around.\nRishe reached the end of the road, and her heart promptly sank all the way to her feet. \u201cOh no.\u201d\nThe front door was thronged with people, all of them surrounding a carriage bearing the royal family\u2019s coat of arms.\nI need to get out of here.\nWhile she stood frozen in indecision, one of the knights doing crowd control shouted, \u201cYour Highness! I have eyes on Lady Rishe!\u201d\n\u201cGet out of my way!\u201d A familiar voice started up a bellow. \u201cLet me through! Rishe, how dare you make me wait so long?\u201d\nRishe\u2019s ex-fianc\u00e9, Crown Prince Dietrich, stepped triumphantly forward.\n\u201cI know the thought of hearing your crimes enumerated by the man you love must pain you, but alas, as future king, it is my duty to bring down the hammer of justice upon a villainess such as yourself!\u201d\n\u201cI see I\u2019ve timed it badly,\u201d Rishe muttered. \u201cIn fact, this is my worst loop yet. I\u2019d rather be barred from the house than see you again.\u201d\n\u201cHmm? What are you grumbling about?\u201d Dietrich looked Rishe up and down. \u201cI knew it. You put on a brave face, but I can sense the sorrow in your heart.\u201d\n\u201cI beg your pardon?\u201d\n\u201cYour heart!\u201d the prince repeated. \u201cYour heart! It must be absolutely crushed! Because I called off our engagement!\u201d\nRishe wasn\u2019t sure where he was drawing these conclusions from. Possibly the same place he mined for all his bottomless self-confidence.\n\u201cI can tell you\u2019ve been wandering aimlessly, distraught,\u201d the prince went on. \u201cLook at you.",
    "query_text": " Your dress is caked in mud, your shoes are broken, and there are cuts marring your face and arms. What other possible cause could there be than heartbreak?\u201d\nRishe narrowed her eyes. \u201cDo you ever stop to think about the words coming out of your mouth?\u201d\n\u201cWhat?\u201d\nHis interpretation of events was fanciful to the point of absurdity. \u201cI did not dirty my dress or snap my shoes out of heartbreak. Because I feel none. You\u2019ve always been a little slow, so I\u2019ll make this"

They\u2019re clearly just here to report my movements to Arnold Hein, Rishe reflected as she walked through a courtyard full of flowers, bucket in hand. Iridescent butterflies cavorted playfully around her feet. He doesn\u2019t seem in a hurry to introduce me to the king. Although if I\u2019m just a hostage, that doesn\u2019t surprise me.\nShe hoped she got to meet the current emperor at least once.

    "prefix_text": " brows lifted high, making him the picture of innocence. \u201cBelieve me, Lady Rishe, every word I speak is chosen with extreme care.\u201d\nFinally realizing who Arnold was, Dietrich visibly paled. \u201cArnold? He\u2019s the crown prince of Galkhein?\u201d\nMary yelped. The knights stood down, shamefaced. The gossip-hungry neighbors who\u2019d gathered to witness a scandal play out drew back in fear.\n\u201cHe\u2019s the demon prince? The one who single-handedly destroyed a whole order of enemy knights?\u201d\n\u201cWatch your tongue, fool! Do you want him to do the same to you?\u201d\nThe two nations enjoyed peaceful relations, but Arnold remained the dreaded prince, heir to the throne of a former enemy. Current rumor wasn\u2019t as widespread as it would be in five years, but he was still regarded with distrust.\nThe onlookers stood rooted to the spot, too terrified to flee.\nWell, this has devolved into a full-fledged disaster.\nRishe heaved a frustrated sigh. \u201cPrince Arnold, to what do we owe this honor? Surely a crown prince would not draw his sword for a mere jest.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m here on business,\u201d Arnold said. \u201cBut first, I must beg forgiveness for my rudeness.\u201d\nHuh, what do you know? Once he became emperor, he\u2019d gladly behead any subject who so much as dared speak a word against him.\nI guess at nineteen he still knew how to apologize.\nIf that surprised her, Arnold\u2019s next act completely obliterated her sense of reality. \nWith a flourish, he fell to his knees. \n\u201cHuh?\u201d Is this actually happening? \nHe was a man destined for an imperial crown. A man who would stand at the head of a military powerhouse and spread his rule across continents.\nArnold, known for his frigid pride, knelt to the disgraced daughter of a duke.\nAnd not only that\u2014his head was bowed, looking nothing so much as a knight swearing allegiance to his lady. If it were anyone else, it would be a delightful, pious image. Instead, the assembled looked on in terrified awe.\nNot Rishe, though.\n\u201cWhat are you doing?\u201d she hissed. \u201cGet up!\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m apologizing for my baseless impertinence. Also, I\u2019m asking you\u2026\u201d He trailed off to take Rishe\u2019s hand, tugging her forward so forcefully she staggered. He gazed up at her.\nUgh. He\u2019s so beautiful. No matter how many times she looked at him, it didn\u2019t become any less disarming. Long eyelashes, arched brows, a noble nose. His bright blue eyes reminded her of the drift ice she\u2019d seen in a northern kingdom, gazing out from a ship in one of her past lives. She knew she was dwelling on this to buy time, even as the reality before her sank in.\n\u201c\u2026to become my wife.\u201d\nShe froze, unable to process the words. \u201cWhat?\u201d Rishe glanced around, desperately searching the faces of the crowd. They all seemed as stunned as she felt. She looked down at Arnold again. \u201cYour wife?\u201d \n\u201cYes, that\u2019s right.\u201d\n\u201cYou want me to become your wife?\u201d\n\u201cYes.\u201d\nRishe couldn\u2019t speak. This was truly happening. It was real. It clicked into place in her head, and she let out a strangled grunt.\nWhat is going on? Why is this happening?\nShock lapped at her, fuzzing at the corners of her vision. He wanted to marry her. Arnold wanted to marry Rishe. Her murderer wanted to marry her.\nWhy is he doing this? He must have some ulterior motive, a broader goal. But I have to give him an answer.\nThe onlookers were holding their breath as Rishe said flatly, \u201cI reject your proposal.\u201d\nArnold said nothing.\nShe had to reject him. She was going to live a long, peaceful, carefree life, damn it, and no one would stop her. And yet\u2026\nArnold began to laugh, and the deep, creeping sense of dread inside Rishe only grew. Why does he seem so amused by this?!\n \n***\n \nHer previous life was her sixth. Disguised as a man, Rishe rose as a warrior of an island country she came upon in her travels. It was a conventional yet charming kingdom formed of red brick. After striking up a friendship with a group of knights who didn\u2019t realize she was a woman, Rishe followed their advice and joined them.\nThe training was grueling enough to make her wish she were dead. Back when she had lived as a noble, she\u2019d learned how to wield a sword for basic self-defense, but training as a noble lady had in no way prepared her for this. She drilled relentlessly, barely taking the time to sleep. Just as she became a full-fledged knight, Emperor Arnold\u2019s forces lay siege to the castle.\n \n***\n \nHow could this happen? \nIn her seventh life, Rishe wearily sank into her chair. Across from her sat Arnold, his legs crossed and chin propped up on his hand, watching her lazily.\n\u201cWhat\u2019s the matter?\u201d he asked. \u201cYou seem unhappy.\u201d\n\u201cYou could say that.\u201d Even her voice was grumpy. Still, she couldn\u2019t very well tell him it was because she bore a grudge from a previous life. After the first time her life rewound to that pivotal moment, she\u2019d resolved to keep her loops a secret. \u201cI had plans for my exile. A brand-new life. And now because of you, my parents are involved. Even the king has heard about it!\u201d\nAfter Rishe rejected Arnold, Dietrich had immediately cried out, \u201cTh-the crown prince of Galkhein proposed to Rishe?!\u201d\nHis shrieks were loud enough to attract the attention of the master and mistress of the manor.\nWhen her parents came out, Rishe had protested, \u201cI\u2019m not going to marry him! I\u2019m leaving the country just as Dietrich commanded.\u201d\nNo one listened. Their faces just paled with nervous confusion.\nJust then, a glittering coach arrived. Half-stuck in the mud, the man inside it was forced to trudge over the swampy ground, and so the king of Hermity himself arrived, staggering and dirt-stained. \nHe grabbed hold of his son\u2019s collar, pushing him into a low bow. He then turned to Prince Arnold and said, rather loudly, \u201cYour Highness! Allow me to apologize for my son\u2019s foolishness! You are an esteemed guest all the way from Galkhein! It is unthinkable he would not offer you the courtesy you are due!\u201d\n\u201cYou\u2019re hurting me, Father! My back!\u201d\nThe king then turned to Rishe. \u201cMy lady, allow me to sincerely apologize as both a king and a father. My son\u2019s behavior toward you has been utterly disgraceful. I beg you to please give Prince Arnold\u2019s proposal due consideration. Not only for your own sake but for the sake of your country.\u201d\nThe king bowed to her as deeply as his son had to Arnold, and her parents joined him. Rishe felt dizzy at the sight of this abject debasement in the presence of citizens.\nArnold, who had been watching the proceedings with a detached amusement, sobered and stepped toward the king. \u201cYour Majesty, please rise.\u201d\nWithout the smirk, Arnold\u2019s face immediately reverted to its cold mask. The king didn\u2019t move. Maybe something in Arnold\u2019s voice kept him frozen.\n\u201cSuch a trifle won\u2019t cause discord between our kingdoms,\u201d he went on. \u201cHowever, I would beg a little time to speak with Lady Rishe.\u201d\nLater, Rishe would learn that Arnold\u2019s attendant had spoken to the king\u2019s own gentleman, certain that his words would reach their target. \u201cMy master took such trouble to attend these festivities, and this is the welcome he is offered? I wonder, what will the emperor think when he learns of his son\u2019s slighting at your nation\u2019s hands?\u201d\n\u201cIf you would, Lady Rishe?\u201d The plump king looked to be on the verge of tears.\nRishe had no obligation to accept and no desire to spend a moment longer in this country than was absolutely necessary. But acquiescence seemed the fastest way to move things along.\nAs her mind whirled, Arnold leaned in to whisper, \u201cIf you refuse to hear my suit, you won\u2019t deter me. I\u2019ll simply move on to Plan B.\u201d\nAnd that was how she found herself in one of the palace\u2019s parlors, here to \u201cjust talk\u201d to Prince Arnold. The ball guests were all gone. It was just the two of them.\n\u201cI want to know what you\u2019re planning,\u201d Rishe said flatly.\n\u201cPlanning? Me?\u201d\n\u201cBy asking me to marry you. You don\u2019t know me. A proposal like this wouldn\u2019t come out of the blue.\u201d\nThis man was destined to become an aggressive warmonger over the next few years. He wouldn\u2019t do anything without a dozen motives.\nPrince Arnold just smiled. \u201cI have no plans. I\u2019m simply enamored with you.\u201d\n\u201cEnamored\u2026?\u201d\nThat was the last thing she\u2019d expected him to say. Asking him to elaborate didn\u2019t seem worth the breath\u2014he was obviously lying. As if this ruthless, inhuman creature with ice in his veins could feel even a flicker of affection.\n\u201cWhy refuse me?\u201d Arnold asked. \u201cYour engagement is broken, you\u2019re on the verge of exile, and you have no faction or supporters. At this rate, you\u2019ll be dead within a fortnight. I\u2019d call my offer a stroke of unbelievable fortune.\u201d\n\u201cYou\u2019re not wrong,\u201d Rishe admitted. \u201cOnce upon a time, I would have jumped at your offer.\u201d\nIf it had been made in her first life, for instance. But now Rishe knew better. Her life was only just getting started, and the future held endless possibilities. After the horror of her sixth loop, she yearned for freedom.\nI don\u2019t want to marry him. I won\u2019t be anyone\u2019s captive. Still\u2026\nRishe, more than anyone, knew that the slightest adjustment could enact profound changes on the trajectory of a life. No doubt she\u2019d have many more lives, but this could be the only one where marriage to Arnold would be an option.\nThe dread emperor. The tyrant. The man who will stoke the fires of war. \nRishe knew the gossip, the endless conjecture behind Arnold Hein\u2019s bloody reign, but she didn\u2019t know the truth.\nWhy? The question had haunted her since her first life. She\u2019d never before had the chance to even speak to him.\nShe had wondered it as a merchant, hearing of the distant outbreak of war. She\u2019d wondered when the news of the dead and dying reached her apothecary. When she had comforted her terrified mistress in her life as a maid, assuring her everything",

Half of her was dying to know. The other half didn\u2019t give a damn. And yet\u2026\nShe recalled a childhood dream. Rather, a longing.\nRishe let out a breath. \u201cYou claim you are enamored with me.\u201d\n\u201cYes. I am completely under your spell.\u201d\nTo think he could spout such nonsense with a straight face!\n\u201cThen will you grant me anything I desire?\u201d\n\u201cSo long as it is within my power,\u201d Arnold said. \u201cAnything you want will be yours.\u201d\nRishe hesitated, gathering her"

Don\u2019t trouble yourself, you must have had quite a scare.\u201d\nThis was not unreasonable, but the wariness in his eyes made it clear he wanted her nowhere near his comrade. He isn\u2019t just being polite. He truly is on guard. \nBeside them, an injured knight groaned as another helped him up. \u201cWhat\u2019s wrong with you?\u201d the second knight asked the first. \n\u201cI-I feel\u2026numb.\u201d\n\u201cWhat? Damn.\u201d The knight grabbed up one of the fallen bandit\u2019s swords, going pale as he inspected the blade. \u201cYour Highness, look at this. Poison.\u201d\nArnold clicked his tongue. \u201cLocate every laceration and bind them close to the heart. Suck the poison from the wounds.\u201d\nHe mostly got that right, at least. In the meantime, Rishe located the nearest bound bandit and pulled his dagger out of its sheath. Its wet coating gleamed in the sunlight, just as the knight had said.\nThey applied the poison liberally\u2014whatever it is must be cheap and easily bought in bulk.\nShe wafted the smell toward her, bracing for something rancid, but detected nothing. Then she brought it closer to her nose.\nIt smells sweet, like an overripe apple. Shea grass and\u2026bluecap mushrooms. All the knights appear to have the same symptoms, so I won\u2019t have to check every blade.\nRishe stood back up and headed for the coach.\nOliver took a step after her. \u201cYour Highness, Lady Rishe is\u2014\u201d\n\u201cLeave her. She may do as she pleases.\u201d\n\u201cShe\u2019s well trained,\u201d Oliver mused. \u201cBut a battlefield is no place for a young lady. She probably wasn\u2019t prepared for such a dreadful spectacle.\u201d\nRishe ignored the murmurs and focused on her work. There they are. I\u2019ll take these, these, and\u2026\n\u201cThe poison must be a sleeping drug,\u201d she overheard Arnold saying. \u201cHunters use such drugs to weaken larger prey. I doubt this dose is lethal.\u201d\n\u201cBut it certainly is annoying,\u201d replied Oliver. \u201cWe\u2019re still two days out from Galkhein. Lugging a company of sleeping men in armor won\u2019t be pleasant.\u201d\n\u201cWe\u2019ll have to stop somewhere nearby. A hunter\u2019s settlement. Perhaps they will have an antidote\u2014\u201d\n\u201cExcuse me.\u201d Rishe, who\u2019d returned from the carriage, raised a hand. \u201cI have an antidote.\u201d\n\u201cWhat?\u201d\nThe entire company stared at her in awe.\n \n***\n \nAs it turned out, Arnold\u2019s guess was right. \nThis sweet-smelling substance was a hunter\u2019s drug, made from ingredients that were only toxic in their raw form. Heat rendered them harmless. Rishe had encountered this poison several times before, curing a customer afflicted with it during her life as an apothecary.\n\u201cA lethal dose for a grown man would fill a wine glass. They likely got less than a hundredth of that,\u201d Rishe explained to Arnold, not looking up from her work. \u201cStill, the numbness can block their airways with the roots of their tongues. It\u2019s best to lay them on their sides.\u201d\n\u201cYes, I understand the theory and the solution.\u201d Arnold gazed down at Rishe\u2019s hands. \u201cThe part I\u2019m struggling with is why you\u2019re the one telling me this.\u201d\n\u201cWell, I know how to make the antidote,\u201d Rishe said patiently as she muddled the herbs together in the white soup bowl she\u2019d borrowed for her flowers. She crushed them with the back of a spoon before adding another dried flower, crushing that as well, and combining them to form a paste. This process would be easier with a pestle, but she wasn\u2019t about to complain. \u201cThis poison is common\u2014it\u2019s cheap and easy to make, which often means the antidote is simple as well.\u201d\nThe antidote was synthesized, in fact, when hunters witnessed a deer showing no symptoms after eating a certain mushroom. They tested those along with other common herbs the deer ate. Rishe mentally thanked them for their scientific rigor as she added a bit of water, straining it all through a cloth.\nRishe stood up, brandishing the bowl of bright green medicine. \u201cBoiling would make the antidote more potent, but this works in a pinch.\u201d\nThat was when she noticed the astonished stares. Unsure of what social faux paus she\u2019d perpetrated, she looked away. Oliver was completely stunned. Arnold looked thoughtful. It was imperative the knights were treated as soon as possible, but to Rishe\u2019s dismay, no one was moving. \nDo they not trust me? That makes sense",

Rishe leaned against the railing, leaning her head back and closing her eyes.\nShe felt like collapsing into bed immediately, but she desperately needed a wash. Still, she didn\u2019t want to pull herself away from the view and the breeze just yet. When she resumed gazing out absentmindedly, something her mother once said drifted back to her. \n\u201cRishe, there is no need for you to think for yourself.\u201d\nShe frowned, the memories coming thick and fast now.\n"
