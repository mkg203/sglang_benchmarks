As of this instant, our engagement is off!\u201d \n\u201cAs you wish, Your Highness.\u201d\n\u201c\u2026Huh?\u201d\nThe prince\u2019s declaration echoed throughout the ballroom. Rishe, the duke\u2019s daughter, bowed in response, her coral-toned hair swaying gracefully. The assembled guests found themselves captivated by her dignified beauty. Despite having just witnessed a broken engagement, they couldn\u2019t bring themselves to pity her.\nSlowly, Rishe lifted her head and fixed the prince with a pale-emerald gaze. It caught him off guard, but he quickly recovered.\n\u201cDidn\u2019t you hear what I just said?! I\u2019m calling off our engagement! Doesn\u2019t that trouble you?\u201d\n\u201cNot really.\u201d\nRishe already knew what happened next: false accusations, exile, and her family severing all ties and leaving her to survive on her own. She turned from the prince. There was no point wasting any time.\nThis is my seventh loop, after all.\nRishe had done this all before.\nThe next few hours will be busy. I must hurry and retrieve my things before I\u2019m barred from the family estate. I don\u2019t want this to be one of the times I\u2019m too slow and I have to start my new life with nothing.\n\u201cRishe, halt and hear me! I have spent the past week perfecting my recitation of your crimes!\u201d\nI should take more than dresses this time\u2014there\u2019s plenty of things I could use out in the world. What trade should I take up? In my first life, I was a merchant. In my second, an apothecary. I\u2019ve got a few more I want to try out\u2026 Augh! If time\u2019s just going to keep resetting, I wish I could start at an earlier point. I need more time to prepare!\n\u201cWait! Rishe!\u201d\nThe crown prince was on the verge of tears, and the spectators struggled to suppress their snickers. \nA thought occurred to Rishe, and she stopped. She then turned, her eyes gleaming beneath long lashes as she stared down her ex-fianc\u00e9. \u201cAh, Your Highness, I almost forgot.\u201d \n\u201cYes, tell me!\u201d the prince fumed. \u201cLet me guess, you are hurt beyond measure and yet love me still\u2026correct?\u201d\nAs if. Rishe was grateful to be granted her freedom. In fact, she was smiling as she said, \u201cI hope you and Lady Mary are happy",

I haven\u2019t told you I love her!\u201d The prince was shouting something behind her, but she paid him no mind"

Not only for your own sake but for the sake of your country.\u201d\nThe king bowed to her as deeply as his son had to Arnold, and her parents joined him.

The king didn\u2019t move.

Once the floors were free of debris, she attacked them with the cloth.\n\u201cLady Rishe, is there anything we can do to help?\nRishe was grateful for the knight\u2019s offer, but she shook her head. \u201cYour job is to guard me, not do my housekeeping.\u201d\n\u201cThis is quite the place to clean on your own, detached though it may be,\u201d the knight said hesitantly. \u201cIt\u2019s not too late to move into the guest chambers instead.\u201d\n\u201cThat\u2019s all right. I like the place already.\u201d\nRishe remained steadfast in her refusal for one reason: readying guest chambers was an awful chore. The palace maids would be expected to work overnight to prepare them, even if the guests were only staying a single night. No speck of dust or strand of hair could remain. Certainly no wrinkled sheets. Rishe knew how exhausting and rigorous a maid\u2019s job was, how nerve-racking.\nShe refused to put the poor dears through such an ordeal for just a few days\u2019 stay. From the sound of things, the palace wasn\u2019t equipped with many housemaids. No doubt they already had their hands full.\n\u201cBesides, take a look.\u201d She held out her arms wide, gesturing to her sparkling clean floor. The knights stared at the bright room in admiration. \u201cCleaning a place with your own hands makes living there that much more satisfying, you see.\u201d\nThe knights smiled their awkward but good-natured agreement.\nRishe worked tirelessly, and before long, the chambers where she would spend the night were ready. The knights offered to carry in the bed, which she allowed.\nWhile they brought in furniture, Rishe started cleaning another room. She had run out of clean water, so she quietly slipped out to the well without informing the knights. It wasn\u2019t quite fair to them, but these were the palace grounds. Surely she didn\u2019t need to be chaperoned everywhere.\nBesides, they\u2019re guards in name only. They\u2019re clearly just here to report my movements to Arnold Hein, Rishe reflected as she walked through a courtyard full of flowers, bucket in hand. Iridescent butterflies cavorted playfully around her feet. He doesn\u2019t seem in a hurry to introduce me to the king.

How about this?\nArnold remained unruffled, evading her next scheme like it was nothing. He grinned down at her, his eyes shining with a dare.\nHe thinks I can\u2019t beat him. His ease vexed her, but it was his smugness that made her angry.\nShe let out a hard breath, attempting a maneuver to lure him in while turning. He leaned back, not falling for it at all.\nHe\u2019s just too good at changing his center of gravity! She kept her astonishment under wraps, but she felt it. Despite how close we\u2019re dancing, I can\u2019t throw off his timing at all. He\u2019s sidestepped all my attempts, and he takes back the lead the second I let down my guard!\nIt made her increasingly angry. She twirled and stepped as the dance dictated, all the while feeling out for moments of weakness. Arnold played along with her game, completely unruffled.\nEvery single time. I\u2019m doing my utmost to trip him up, but he doesn\u2019t even seem annoyed! At this point she\u2019d just settle for any reaction at all.\nTheir unusual dance style had gathered a crowd. Rishe paid them no mind, focused only on her goal. Then something occurred to her, and her breath caught in her throat.\nWait a minute, he has left an opening. It\u2019s the same one from before. She thought back to their fight to the death, to that moment when she had managed to draw blood. That may indeed have been his only weakness.\nIf I strike the same way\u2014huh? Before she could try, Arnold appeared to lose patience, wrapping his arm around her waist. He bent her back into a dip so deep it felt like he\u2019d pulled a carpet from under her feet. She yelped, grabbing at him reflexively, clinging tight. His big hands gripped her securely enough to mitigate the sensation of falling. Relief flooded through her, and she felt a laugh rumble against her ear.\nThe music came to an end with one last ringing note. She blinked. The dance is over?\nA hush fell over the ballroom.
