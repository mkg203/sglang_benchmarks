Her gaze darted around as if looking for help.\nPulling herself together, she forced herself to follow Rishe\u2019s directions. She thought back and finally alighted on a response. \u201cI\u2026I didn\u2019t know how to do the job. Before, when my family was still prominent, I\u2019d washed shirts and bedsheets. Never gowns or military uniforms.\u201d\n\u201cPerfectly reasonable,\u201d Rishe said. \u201cOnly natural for someone just starting out.\u201d\n\u201cThe older girls were so busy, they told me to just watch them since they didn\u2019t have time to teach me. When I had questions\u2026well, there was nobody to ask.\u201d\n\u201cI bet. And did you have any other problems?\u201d\n\u201cWell, yes. There was a lot to learn. Different kinds of soap and washboards depending on the cloth. You use different tools for different materials. I had to learn how they worked and how to put them away. I was\u2026punished if I didn\u2019t get it right the first time.\u201d\nThe newcomers were exchanging surprised looks. Rishe understood why.\nEverything Diana said was familiar to them. They spent valuable time searching for their materials and the proper ways to use them, but they shrank from asking for help. Everyone always looked so busy. This was a universal problem.\n\u201cDespite all that, I got better!\u201d Diana protested. \u201cI only needed to be taught once. Unlike them! They\u2019re useless!\u201d\n\u201cYes, well. There\u2019s a difference between you and them,\u201d Rishe told Diana. \u201cYou can read and write.\u201d\n\u201cOh!\u201d Diana started in surprise. Elsie looked at the floor.\nThe literacy rate among commoners was low no matter where you went. Very few families had the means to afford an education, especially for daughters. Diana had been born to a merchant\u2019s family\u2014she\u2019d received formal schooling. The maids she was close friends with were likely from similar backgrounds. The majority of those in service were not so fortunate.\n\u201cWhat if you only received instructions on how to do a job once and weren\u2019t able to write it down to remind yourself later?\u201d Rishe asked. \u201cWould you be so confident?\u201d\n\u201cI-I don\u2019t\u2014\u201d Diana reflexively thrust a hand into her apron pocket, where she had a list of daily tasks recorded in her neat handwriting to reference throughout the day.
